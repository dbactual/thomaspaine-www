Sir, – Reading Jonathan Clark’s essay on Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man
(Commentary, September 18) reminds me of a small dog nipping at the
heels of a passing steed. History is passing Clark by, and he does not
accept the fall of monarchism, and the demon Paine who precipitated
the fall. Clark has an ideological approach to Paine, evidenced by a
recent essay similar in dubious content and tone, “Thomas Paine: The
English dimension” (reviewed here: www.thomaspaine.org), in which
Clark described the British government in 1792: “the most famous and
successful example of the representative system, the Westminster
Parliament, was already operative in the Britain that Paine rejected
with hatred” (Selected Writings of Thomas Paine, Shapiro and Calvert,
eds, 2014). No need for the reforms of 1832 – it was the most
successful “representative” form! The rotten boroughs, the autocratic
repression, the endless wars, the oppressive poverty. Quite
successful. And Rights of Man was the death knell for monarchism, the
system cherished by Clark.

So as a historian, Clark strains to find a soft underbelly to take
apart Rights of Man. And he thinks he has found it in a few pages
describing the events of the beginning of the French Revolution. It
was the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College in New York
which confirmed that this passage was mostly written by Lafayette, not
an unusual practice of collaborative thinkers in the period, as Clark
should be aware. Lafayette was proud (as Clark confirms) to be a part
of Paine’s epic tome. Paine, Jefferson and Lafayette spent weeks
together in the late 1780s discussing the revolutionary political
philosophy taking shape in the transatlantic atmosphere, and there is
data to suggest Jefferson also had a hand in these few pages. But
Clark makes this accounting of a historical event a “foundational
episode” in Rights of Man, when in fact it merely sets the stage for
the philosophy of government and human rights that has made Rights of
Man central to the world movement for justice, liberty and
democracy. I know Clark has credentials, but at what point does
academia ask about his motives and cherry-picked manipulation of
historical details? He would discount the accuracy of these pages
because they didn’t come directly from the mind of Paine, a man he
diminishes at every chance, and dismisses as irrelevant at every
opportunity. A first-hand account from a capable eyewitness is a
valuable piece of literature to use. And Paine did so properly, never
pretending to have been standing in Paris as these events unfolded.

Sir, – As I am currently writing a textbook on Thomas Paine’s Rights
of Man, I would like to respond to Jonathan Clark’s essay.

Although it may well be possible that Paine had access to other
sources, to suggest that the disputed passage was lifted from
Lafayette or other writers goes too far even if we concede the
flattering portrayal of the young marquis given his initial tepidness
in the pursuit of reform. Indeed, if Paine was as “repellently
egotistical” as claimed by Clark elsewhere, would he have stooped to
engage in such practices?

As for the 6,000-word excerpt itself, there is no doubt that even
though it reveals Paine’s interpretation of the French Revolution,
it is at most a descriptive narrative of the conflicts among the
parlement of Paris, the Assembly of Notables, and the royal
court. Note, too, that it also serves to reinforce his earlier criticisms of the aristocracy and the king’s ministers, forming a
consistent whole with the rest of the work. The very phrase that Clark
identifies as Paine’s – the equation between “nobility” and
“no-ability” – may have been borrowed from Lafayette, who had referred
to them as “notables” in 1787.

This brings us to Clark’s more contentious claim that “rights are
everywhere in Paine’s text” yet remain “hardly unpacked”. It is in
these very pages that Paine refashioned the radical Dissenting and
Whiggish ideas of such writers as James Burgh, Major John Cartwright
and Joseph Priestley, recombining them with an infusion of
Jeffersonian anti-aristocratic populism: much of which came to be
refracted in the writings of French reformers and radicals such as
Marat and Robespierre. This occurred at a time when British and French
reformers exchanged thoughts on the earlier English republican ideas
of Marchamont Nedham and James Harrington.

Paine’s true achievement lies in his analysis of the inequities faced
by his contemporaries. Unlike any of the writings of the English Whigs
or the French physiocrates, Paine’s Rights introduced the idea of
natural and civil rights to a much wider political audience in a
highly accessible style, challenging the feudalism of the British
government, while proposing physiocrat-like measures to benefit the
poor and elderly: ideas which had not been circulated so
comprehensively since the Diggers in the late 1640s and would not be
revived until 1935 with the arrival of Social Security in America.

It is therefore not surprising that Paine came to be treated as a
modern Prometheus of sorts. Perhaps this is why good ol’ Tom continues to attract such “hagiographic readings” in our own time as we
struggle with the familiar problems of increased inequality and the
disproportionate political influence of the wealthy.

Sir, – My essay on Thomas Paine (Commentary, September 18) provoked
some heated responses (Letters, September 25). I would welcome a
serious academic debate, since my aim is to encourage greater
attention to a figure recently too often taken for granted rather than
rethought historically. What, then, did your correspondents offer?

First, Gary Berton. He is part of a team at Iona College, New York,
that is undertaking the computer modelling of Paine’s prose in order
to determine which anonymous essays, long credited to Paine, were
probably not by him. I have applauded this enterprise since first
learning of it, as I still do, for I had been engaged in a similar
exercise using the more traditional tools of textual criticism. To
that end, we exchanged co-operative emails, and I supplied Berton
with successive drafts of the Appendix to my book, “Paine
De-attributions”, to assist his own research. When I framed the
hypothesis that the key 6,000-word passage in Rights of Man was not
primarily by Paine, I announced the idea at a conference at Yale,
copied it to colleagues, and conveyed it also to Berton. He
replied “I am also intrigued about the Rights of Man passage, and we
will add that to our testing list as we perfect our techniques”. He
later wrote “There is nothing in there [my Appendix] that we disagree
with”. His TLS letter did not dispute my reattribution to Lafayette,
but rightly recorded that the Iona team “confirmed” it. So what is his
problem?

His problem is that Berton is also the highly engaged leader of the
American Thomas Paine National Historical Association. Later, he read
other work on Paine by myself and reacted strongly against it,
evidently on the grounds that I was insufficiently respectful of St
Thomas. What, then, is the substance of his case? It is only that I
am a bad man to write such things. Now, I must seriously protest
against this estimate of my character. The truth is that I am very,
very much wickeder, since far from being insufficiently respectful I
take the view that it is no part of the historian’s remit to intrude
normative judgements on people or movements in the past at all; and
that this intrusion merely occludes real understanding. So it is here:
Berton thinks it enough to remind readers to repeat the familiar idea
that Rights of Man is “central to the world movement for justice,
liberty and democracy”, but I, having been brought up with that very
assumption, now find that much evidence points in different
directions. It will be unfortunate if Berton’s indignation detracts
from the work of the Iona College group on the verification of texts,
in which study there is much common ground between us.

Second, Frances Chiu. She was evidently unaware that the Iona College
results confirmed my reattribution, and, reasserting Paine’s
authorship, repeats the conventional interpretation that Rights of Man
was central in the triumph of natural rights theory.  Again, this is
what I, too, once thought but have come to doubt. I argue at length
elsewhere that natural rights discourse became ever more widely
diffused during the eighteenth century, to the point where it was
easily replaced by the discourses of utilitarianism and socialism in
the early nineteenth. A wider and longer perspective than that yielded
by Chiu’s reading of Rights of Man alone is needed if this hypothesis
is to be fairly tested. Her description of “the British government”
of the 1790s as “feudalism” hardly inspires confidence in her
historical grounding.

Paine was a remarkable and important figure; but he was remarkable
and important in ways that Berton and Chiu have not grasped. If these
arguments are to be adequately explored in academe, we must set aside
the passionate normative commitments, for and against, that have
distorted the interpretation of Paine from his lifetime to the
present. I would encourage Gary Berton and Frances Chiu in that cause.

In response once again to Clark on Thomas Paine and Rights of Man, I
have only space for two points in correction: First, he misrepresents
the exchanges regarding our Text Analysis work. The purpose is not, as
he stated, to simply de-attribute misattributed Paine essays, but to
discover new, undiscovered essays of Paine. His intent was the former,
so he ignored our real purpose. To date there are already far more new
finds than his confirmed list of misattributions, a list that consists
mostly of essays previously questioned by other scholars. We
questioned several on his list as inconclusive so far, but we were
adamant that “Magazine in America” from his list was clearly
Paine’s. So his statement that we agreed with the list is flawed,
shall we say. And he was no help in our process. As to this passage
from Rights of Man, we had three contributing possible authors, led by
Lafayette, but also including Paine and Jefferson, suggesting the
strong collaboration between the men I stated in my other response. So
my “problem” is not about the source of the passage, but its
interpretation. To Clark it’s the smoking gun that brings into
question the importance and legacy of Rights of Man; to most informed
scholars of Paine, it is a well-known footnote to the work that goes
back to Conway in 1894 who noted it came from Paine and “the best men
in France--Lafayette, Danton, Brissot, and others,--".(Thank you,
Mariam Touba). His strained interpretation is the “problem”.

Secondly, my indignation is with someone presenting baseless judgments
as an established historian, not objective deliberation. In personal
dealings with Clark I have seen his selective, anti-Paine vision in
action. I am here not to defend Paine, but to bring what knowledge I
have gained in 45 years of studying him, study that afterward brought
me to the Paine Association. We are applying cutting edge technology
to get to the truth, and to see Clark manipulate that according to his
own ideology raises indignation. To extrapolate this rediscovered
passage in Rights of Man into re-evaluating the French Revolution is
at best a misguided attempt to cast doubt on Paine’s impact on
history, at worst an absurd dead end.

If Jonathan Clark wants a “serious academic debate,” he shall have
one.  

Had Clark not decided to respond so hastily, he would have realized
that my statement on Paine’s “challenging of the feudalism of the
British government” was not necessarily claiming that Britain was
feudal in the 1790s--but rather that the contours of the British
government were still essentially so.  There is a reason, after all,
why reformers and radicals from the 1770s through 1820s stubbornly
invoked the idea of the Norman Yoke--and why so many objected
vehemently to Burke’s veneration for the age of chivalry in
his Reflections on the Revolution in France. There is also a reason
why James Mackintosh, Vicesimus Knox and so many others complained of
the many lingering feudal vestiges; as William Godwin famously put it,
“the feudal spirit still survives.”  The fact is that the church and
aristocracy (in both the House of Lords and House of Commons)
continued to wield disproportionate political influence in late
18th-century England: indeed, it is one of the reasons for the
popularity of the Gothic novel in the 1790s, with its mock medieval
settings, crumbling castles, arrogant aristocrats and evil
ecclesiastics.  Of all people, Clark should know this as he repeatedly
refers to 18th-century England as an “ancien regime state,” where
“hereditary rule, primogeniture, and religion were society’s
organizing principles.”     

As for the apparent replacement of the discourse of natural rights by
those of utilitarianism and socialism, Clark should also be reminded
that this shift in discourse had far more to do with the sheer facts
of rapid industrialization and the repeal of the Test and Corporation
Acts than any significant diminution of Paine’s popularity. Let’s not
forget  that arguments made by Paine in favor of universal male
suffrage and against hereditary government and church-state
establishments came to be re-adopted by Bentham after 1809--whatever
his dismissive references to natural rights as “nonsense on stilts”
and “bawling on paper.” Nor is it surprising that the growth of
capitalism would necessitate a shift from the demonization of
aristocrats to the demonization of capitalists, one accompanied no
less by a shift in rhetoric from the rights of man to the rights of
labourers (something which Paine himself had briefly addressed in
his Case of the Excise Officers in 1774 and Rights of Man, Part 2). 

But even here, it is difficult to overlook Paine’s impact on radical
journalism and the rise of Chartism: a movement that would influence
Engels and Marx. Indeed, if anything, the spirit of Paine--rather than
communism--can be said to be the spectre that was haunting
19th-century Europe and America alike: nowhere yet everywhere. That
Paine’s fundamental emphases on equality and a government which
attends to the needs of the vast majority have remained central to
liberal and progressive thought throughout the 19th and 20th centuries
cannot be denied, regardless of the actual terms of discourse. This
may explain why Tea Baggers and Occupiers alike have embraced Paine
for his populist rhetoric and bashing of elites.

Sir, - You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it
drink. Recently (Letters, October 2) I invited your two correspondents
to be at least open to thinking historically about Thomas Paine,
rather than repeat passionate commitments for or against him. I
suggested that there just might be evidence that pointed away from the
conventional interpretations. Alas, all in vain. They respond
(Letters, October 9), as Gary Berton too frankly discloses, with
“indignation”.

I questioned Frances Chiu’s remarkable characterisation of “the
British government” of the 1790s as “feudalism”, but in her latest
letter she decides to nail her colours to this mast. She asserts, even
after reflection, that “the contours of the British government were
still essentially so”, as if “the church and aristocracy” in 1790 were
“essentially” the same as in 1090. It would be unseemly to argue
further against so weak a case. Inconsistently, she sees natural
rights discourse as dominant in her feudal society of the 1790s; but
the contradiction is evidently unimportant for her, as long as Paine
can be credited with that dominance.

There is a problem, though, partly because the conventional scenario
of the supposed inspirational transference of revolutionary natural
rights theory from America to France did not rest on Paine’s authority
(such a transference has anyway, in my view, been overstated), and she
does not think through the significance of the Iona group’s
endorsement of my argument that the “primary author” of the key
passage of Rights of Man was not Paine.

Berton cannot disagree, only protesting (perhaps irrelevantly) that it
is “possible” that others as well as Lafayette may have had a hand in
composing this passage (I had myself argued that Paine “wrote out”
this narrative, and put some of it into his own words). We await the
results of quantitative research on that point. Meanwhile – and this
is an unrelated problem – Berton can still only see any polite
questioning of familiar nostrums as an “anti-Paine vision”, a
normative attack on the man himself. If he holds to this article of
faith, I fear that nothing will persuade him. By all means let the
results of the computer-assisted analysis of prose styles contribute
to our knowledge; but let those results not contribute to hagiography.

To pick up on Clark’s horsey proverb, let me add a rejoinder by
observing that it would be equally unseemly to flog a dead horse. As
such, I would like to reiterate the importance of fact, fact,
fact--even at the risk of sounding like that other Thomas, Dickens’
Gradgrind--and begin by addressing Clark’s somewhat disingenuous
statements on the curious phenomenon of a natural rights discourse in
a period which still betrayed the contours of feudalism. Again, one
need look no further than the pages of another work of his, The
Language of Liberty 1660-1832, for validation. Here, Clark explains
that although “it may appear paradoxical that 18th-century British
society….should have been increasingly pictured by its own dissidents
in terms of sinister feudal, monarchical and clerical anachronisms,”
this apparent inconsistency can be explained by recalling that the
“rebellions of the 1640s and 1688 did not constitute a revolutionary
watershed” and that in fact “many social forms and institutions of
ancient lineage survived into a Whig present to be the targets of
attack.” So there you have it--straight from the horse’s mouth! Unless
Clark has completely reversed his position from 1993, I see no reason
for his quibble.

Indeed, the very nature of that quibble should make us question
Clark’s assessments  even more rigorously. I do not object so much to
the attribution of the 6,000-word passage to Lafayette, Jefferson or
anyone else as to Clark’s views on Paine’s interpretations of the
American and French revolutions--or the still more incredible notion
of Paine’s overall inconsequentiality. To reiterate how the various
state constitutions and Declaration of Independence--not to mention
Paine’s own widely read Letter addressed to the Abbe Raynal--were
subjects of debate and sources of inspiration for the Estates General
of 1789 is to belabor the obvious but not exclusive influence of the
American revolution. As for Paine himself, let us remember the famous,
if grudging acknowledgment by his arch nemesis, John Adams--the last
person to be guilty of Paine "hagiography": “I know not whether any
man in the world has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs
for the last thirty years than Tom Paine….Call it then the Age of
Paine.” In short, whether or not one admires the ideas of this
"mongrel between pig and puppy," it was true in 1805--and still true
more than two centuries later.

It is a ruse to suggest we are not thinking historically. That’s all
we are doing. But history is an interpretive art, and as such, when
facts are left out, or exaggerated, then the interpretation is
skewed. Paine’s role, in general, has not been exaggerated, but
usually the opposite.  Most history books for 200 years have
marginalized Paine. That was the “conventional” interpretation
then. It is that bias that has been largely overcome in the last 30
years, led by Claeys and Aldridge, as well as E. Foner. The absent
facts, sidelined by biased judges of history, were placed into the
discussion and Paine’s significance grew in the eyes of this
generation of scholars. It is not clear whether this is what Clark now
calls “conventional”. That may be (if that means it is winning the
day), but it is evolving with the new data and analyses.

The noted historian of the American Revolution, for example, Bernard
Bailyn, had little use for Paine, and mentioned him as an also-ran to
history, relying on the work of the historians of the past 200
years. But in his work he isolated one tract that he considered as
providing “brilliant sparks thrown off by the clash of Revolutionary
politics in Pennsylvania, lit up the final steps of the path that led
directly to the first constitutions of the American states.”
(Ideological Origins, pg 182) He put this pamphlet, “Four Letters on
Interesting Subjects”, as one of a few that defined the American creed
of government and represented the fruits of the American
Revolution. Bailyn was unaware that Paine had written it, but our Text
Analysis confirms Aldridge’s suggestion that this was Paine. I wonder
if Bailyn would have reconsidered Paine’s role if he had this
knowledge? That creed spread to France where Paine brought those ideas
of constitutions to his work on the 1793 constitution, which then
spread to the public debates. Facts, not hagiography. This is just one
of many contributions to our growing knowledge - not to idolize, but
to elucidate. Our information will be that much richer and
comprehensive.


The passage in question is not a new discovery, and it is descriptive
not theoretical. It does not begin to undermine the debate over
natural rights theory, or Paine’s place in the history of political
philosophy. Clark needs to find something of substance if he is to
reverse the scholarship on Paine.
