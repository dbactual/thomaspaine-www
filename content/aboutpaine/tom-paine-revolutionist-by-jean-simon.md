   Thomas Paine was born on Jan. 29, 1737. On Jan. 10, 1776, his historic
   call for the American revolution, Common Sense was published. Both of
   these events nowadays receive passing notice. But for those who seek to
   understand the dynamics of the revolutionary process in America and the
   role outstanding individuals played in that process, Tom Paine deserves a
   much larger place than the official hero-makers give him.

   Most history books, if they mention Paine at all, merely note the
   undeniable fact that Common Sense was an important contribution to the
   preparation of the public mind for the open revolt against England. Few
   attempt to explain what went into the making of the man and why he was
   able to leave his indelible mark on American history.
    

    

   Early Background

   Tom Paine was born in Thetford, England, the son of a Quaker staymaker
   (corset maker), a handicraft of the same category as shoemaking or
   tailoring in that day; his mother was a conservative Church of England
   member. So from his earliest childhood Paine's critical approach to
   religion was stimulated, by the differences in his own home.

   An only child, he was sent for six or seven years to a local grammar
   school which differed from most in that it provided some education in
   history and science. He left school at the age of 13 to be taught
   staymaking. He ran away to sea after five years, was brought back home by
   his father before he could actually leave the country, but ran away again,
   this time to spend a brief period on a privateer.

   During the rest of his early life in England he supported himself by
   working from time to time as an exciseman, as a staymaker and as a
   teacher.
    

    

   Philosophical Influence

   In London in 1757 he attended philosophical lectures at night. The
   lecturer was A. Ferguson, author of the History of Civil Society (1750)
   which is quoted favorably by Marx in Capital. Marx refers to Ferguson as
   Adam Smith's predecessor and an economist who had a keen appreciation of
   the harmful effects of the development of capitalist manufacture on the
   worker. Ferguson undoubtedly influenced Paine's philosophical and
   political-economic thinking, as expressed in his later writings.

   Paine also participated in philosophical debates in a club that met at the
   White Hart Tavern in Lewes, where he was stationed as an exciseman, or
   government tax inspector, in 1768.

   In 1772 he acted as spokesman for the excisemen seeking an increase in
   pay. He wrote a tract called The Case of the Officers of the Excise which
   cited the discrepancy between their nominal salary and their real wages,
   described the scope and effects of poverty, and urged the government in
   its own self-interest to raise wages in order to guarantee the honesty and
   loyalty of its employees by removing temptations.

   Spokesman in a Wage Struggle

   Subsidized by the contributions of the excisemen, Paine published the
   report and spent some time in London lobbying It Parliament. The net
   result of his negotiations was no raise for the men, and the spotting of
   Paine as a "trouble-maker" to be removed at the first opportunity.

   While in London, Paine met Benjamin Franklin, who was there on behalf of
   the colonies, made a favorable impression and later received a letter of
   recommendation from him to friends in Philadelphia.

   Then Paine was finally removed from his government job, for being "absent
   without leave," he settled his financial accounts by selling the property
   of a small shop he and his wife and maintained, separated from his wife,
   and left for Philadelphia, where he arrived November 30, 1774, with
   Franklin's letter of introduction.

   In Revolutionary America

   By January 1775 he was editor of the Pennsylvania Magazine, and actively
   interested in the colonial cause. The issue of independence had not yet
   been set forth positively by the revolutionary leaders, who still
   functioned on the basis of demands for reforms.

   The first clear-cut call to the masses to break with England and monarchy,
   to give up the "patchwork" of reform and embark on the revolutionary
   course of independence, was issued in Paine's Common Sense , published in
   January 1776. With this Paine took his place as the chief propagandist of
   the American Revolution.

   The pamphlet was written in simple, direct language, devoid of all obscure
   historical, biblical and other learned references and allusions so common
   in the literary style of the day. It was a powerful appeal to every
   segment of the population to join in a broad united front to win complete
   freedom from England and embark on a career as an independent nation.

   A biographer of Thomas Paine has called Common Sense "This pamphlet, whose
   effect has never been paralleled in literary history ..." The passage of
   60 years since this comment was written has seen great mass socialist
   movements and a response to Marxist pamphlets far overshadowing Paine.
   Nevertheless, the effect of Paine's great tract has still never been
   paralleled by anything in the literary history of the United States.

   Program of the Revolution

    We must recall that when Paine penned Common Sense , the full program of
   the Revolution had not as yet been given to the people. The Revolutionary
   War was under way, and the people were in effect fighting for
   independence, but without as yet realizing it. No one, not even Samuel
   Adams himself, had as yet put forward the full revolutionary program; not
   openly at any rate. All minds were weighed down by the incubus of past
   centuries: monarchy, empire, feudal servitude, all the untouchables of
   bygone days clouded the minds of the living.

   Into this atmosphere, Thomas Paine flung his remarkable pamphlet, which
   advocated, at one stroke, independence, republicanism, equalitarian
   democracy, and intercolonial unity! The Revolution was thenceforward armed
   with a program, or, to put the matter precisely, the program that was in
   the minds and private conversation of most radicals became the public
   property of the revolution.

   Paine's great literary gift sparkles from every page of Common Sense  He
   stirred the workers and farmers of colonial times with his blunt and
   unceremonious comments, such as this:

   "In England a King hath little more to do than to make war and give away
   places (jobs); which, in plain terms, is to impoverish the nation and set
   it together by the ears. A pretty business indeed for a man to be allowed
   eight hundred thousand sterling a year for, and worshiped into the
   bargain! Of more worth is one honest man to society, and in the sight of
   God, than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived."

   In similar blunt terms, he made out the case for completing the Revolution
   by independence. "Everything that is right or reasonable pleads for
   separation. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries,
   `TIS TIME TO PART.'" These words sank into the consciousness of the new
   nation, and prepared the way for the Declaration of Independence, which
   followed in six months.

   Indicative of how popular Paine's arguments were, Common Sense immediately
   became a best seller. About one hundred thousand copies were sold within
   the first six months after its publication. Since there was no copyright
   law, several pirated editions were also widely sold, so that the total
   distribution of the pamphlet is estimated at at least three hundred
   thousand - and this at a time when the population was less than three
   million!

   Paine and the Crisis

    Paine's other major literary contributions to the American revolution
   were the Crisis papers, issued periodically throughout the war. Aimed at
   maintaining the morale of the soldiers and the colonial forces, they
   reported on the events in the war, polemicized against the British and
   American Tories appealed to the British people, and exuded revolutionary
   optimism despite defeats.

   It is difficult to measure the effect of any particular document, but the
   circumstances surrounding the issuance of the first Crisis pamphlet give
   some indication of the basis for the comment of Joel Barlow, a
   contemporary American poet who served as minister to France under Madison.
   "The great American cause owed as much to the pen of Paine as to the sword
   of Washington," Barlow wrote.

   Morale was at a low ebb when Paine started the Crisis series. From August
   to December 1776, the Americans had suffered defeats, retreats and
   desertions. Congress had fled to Baltimore. Washington's freezing soldiers
   were retreating across New Jersey. Paine, who was accompanying them,
   gauged the mood and the need correctly, when, without false optimism, he
   wrote the now famous lines:

   "These are the times that try men's souls: The summer soldier and the
   sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his
   country; but be that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man
   and woman. Tyranny, like bell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this
   consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the
   triumph."

   Washington had the pamphlet read aloud to every army detachment. A few
   nights later the army made the icy crossing of the Delaware that has been
   immortalized in painting and story, and won the victory at Trenton that
   began to turn the tide.

   Paine as a Man of Action

    Acknowledgments of the tremendous role played by Paine in mobilizing
   sentiment for the revolution have been plentiful from his enemies as well
   as his friends, and from all the leaders of the colonial struggle as well
   as historians since. But few give a rounded picture of his activity in the
   revolution.

   In July 1776 Paine joined the Army as volunteer secretary to General
   Roberdeau, commander of the Flying Camp, an outfit that moved quickly to
   trouble spots where it was needed. From there Paine went "to the army of
   General Nathaniel Greene as volunteer aide-de-camp.

   In January 1777 Paine was appointed secretary of a commission to treat
   with the Indians in eastern Pennsylvania. His activities in Pennsylvania
   and around the Continental Congress continued throughout the war, and were
   by no means limited to legal and official bodies. He served, for example
   on the Committee of Inspection, a price control committee formed at a mass
   meeting in Philadelphia on May 27, 1779, to deal with merchants,
   innkeepers and others engaging in war-profiteering at the expense of the
   public. As W.E. Woodward puts it in his biography of Paine: "The committee
   had no legal standing, but it proposed to accomplish its ends by popular
   pressure; or by force, if necessary."

   In April 1776 he was elected secretary of the Committee on Foreign
   Affairs, formerly the Committee on Secret Correspondence, but was induced
   to resign on January 9, 1779, after he had exposed what he considered
   shady dealings in some of the secret diplomacy of individuals involved in
   securing French aid for the revolution.

   When Philadelphia was about to be attacked by the British in September
   1777, Paine was convinced the city could be saved if the citizens were
   called out, fully informed on the military situation, and mobilized to
   build barricades and prepare for street-fighting.

   Paine went to General Mifflin, who was then in the city, with his
   proposal, asking Mifflin, in his own words,

   "if two or three thousand men could be mustered up whether we might depend
   on him to command them, for without someone to lead, nothing could be
   done. He declined that part, not being then very well, but promised what
   assistance he could. A few hours after this the alarm happened. I went
   directly to General Mifflin but he had set off, and nothing was done. I
   cannot help being of the opinion that the city might have been saved ..."
    

   His Selflessness

   In 1779 Paine's chronic poverty was in a particularly acute stage, but
   within six months of his election as clerk of the Pennsylvania Assembly in
   November, he contributed $500 of his annual salary to head a subscription
   list for the relief of the Army. The funds raised were used to establish
   the Bank of Pennsylvania to provide for the Army's needs.

   Paine resigned his post in November 1780 and went on a mission to France,
   seeking aid for the colonies. He returned in August with 2,500,000 livres,
   but Paine was so broke that he had to borrow ferry passage across the
   Delaware on his way home.

   Upon the conclusion of the war Paine spent most of his time at his home in
   Bordentown, N.J., working on his inventions. A typical product of the
   spirit of scientific inquiry of his age, he was preoccupied after the
   revolution with the development of his idea for an iron bridge planned for
   the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia. He also worked on a planing machine,
   a new type of crane, an improved carriage wheel, and smokeless candles. He
   corresponded with Franklin, who encouraged him to continue.

   A Permanent Radical 

    

   Paine left for France with his model bridge on April 26, 1787. When he
   returned to America fifteen years later, revolutionary sentiment had so
   far abated that he was much too radical for his former colleagues and he
   was now a pariah where he had been a hero. He still had some friends, but
   persons were publicly discriminated against for holding to his views.
   Jefferson, however, invited him to stay for a while at the Executive
   Mansion, and he did. An attempt to murder Paine was made at his New
   Rochelle home on Christmas Eve 1804. Though he suspected Christopher
   Derrick, a local laborer, this revolutionist who exalted objectivity and
   abhorred personal vindictiveness refused to press charges.

   In January 1805 Paine went to New York City to live. He and his admirers
   continued to he victimized for his views. When he went to vote in New
   Rochelle on Election Day, 1806, the witch-hunters of his time, got in
   their final blow: they charged that the man who had lived for nothing but
   the American cause and the spreading of its principles to Europe was an
   alien, and denied him the ballot.

   When Paine died on June 8, 1809, after prolonged illness, at 59 Grove St.,
   New York City, he had been reduced to almost complete friendlessness, so
   that the only attendants at his funeral in New Rochelle were a Quaker
   watchmaker, friends from France - Mrs. Bonnevine and her two sons - and
   two Negro pall-bearers.
    

   Revolutionary Concept of World Scope

   The significance of the man and his ideas remain, but they cannot be fully
   appreciated on the basis of his role in the American Revolution alone.
   Paine was not a narrow patriot in the modern sense. He was a principled
   revolutionist first, and when he went to France, and then England, after
   American independence was established, he continued to' champion the
   struggles against the ancient order in those countries as whole-heartedly
   as he had the American cause. "Where liberty is not there is my country,"
   he is said to have declaimed at his departure from America.

   During his stay in England he was the guest of Edmund Burke and other Whig
   leaders for a period, while they were trying to court favorable trade
   relations with America. But their friendship cooled when they found him
   unsympathetic to their proposals.

   Paine arrived in Paris in 1789 when the French Revolution was underway.
   Lafayette gave Paine the key to the Bastille as a token of esteem for
   George Washington, symbol of the American Revolution.

   When the French Revolution was viciously attacked and the divine right of
   kings upheld by Burke in his Reelections, published in 1790, Paine took up
   his pen again in defense of revolution, and wrote an answer, Part I of the
   Rights of Man. It was approved by the English Society for Promoting
   Constitutional Knowledge, and other democratic groups; but created a
   considerable controversy not only in England, but in America as well.
   Jefferson, Madison and Randolph commended it, and Jefferson sent it to an
   American printer.
    

   Activity in French Revolution

   In July 1791 Paine was a prime mover in the organization of the Republican
   Society which aimed at the overthrow of monarchy and establishment of a
   French Republic. At the time, many who were later to become Jacobins were
   still hesitant about advocating the abolition of monarchy, but the
   Republican Society placarded Paris with a manifesto written by Paine
   demanding the abdication of the king and elimination of the office.

   In November of the same year, back in London, Paine was guest of honor at
   the annual dinner of the Revolution Society formed to commemorate the
   English Revolution of 1688. There he made a speech toasting "The
   Revolution of the World" - the first man to raise that slogan, according
   to some historians. His remarks were noted and added to the dossier of the
   British government's preparations to arrest him for sedition.

   Part II of the Rights of Man was a continuation of the attack on monarchy
   and aristocracy, and was dedicated to Lafayette. Its publication early in
   1792 evoked a veritable lynch campaign against Paine in England. Burke's
   supporters instigated public protest meetings, book-burnings of the Rights
   of Man,  and the distribution of medallions bearing slogans like "The End
   of Pain," "The Wrongs of Man," and "We dance; Paine swings." Paine's
   publisher was arrested for printing seditious literature, and the legal
   sale of the book was stopped by royal proclamation. Black market sales
   continued.

   Paine fought the attack on his writings, distributing free copies of the
   Rights of Man and encouraging his supporters to stand up for his ideas at
   meetings called to incite feeling against them.

   Meanwhile the book was translated into French and acclaimed in that
   country. In August 1792 the French Assembly conferred the honorary title
   of Citizen on him, and four departments elected him to represent them in
   the National Convention. Consequently, when the English issued a warrant
   for his arrest, he left for France. He was found guilty of high treason in
   England in his absence.

   In France, Paine participated in the Convention with the Girondists. He
   was selected October 11 to help draft the constitution but he incurred
   popular disfavor when he attempted to save the life of the king by urging
   banishment instead of death, and was eventually expelled from the
   Convention in December 1793.

   While awaiting the next turn of events in the Revolution, he completed his
   The Age of Reason, an attack on the Bible and organized religion and an
   exposition of his Deist views.

   Paine was arrested by order of a Committee of Public Safety in January
   1794. Through the machinations of the American representative in France at
   the time, his old enemy, the arch-conservative Gouverneur Morris, Paine
   was disclaimed as an American citizen and kept in prison: Only when Morris
   was finally recalled at the request of the French, and replaced with James
   Monroe, was Paine released.

   He remained in France, living with Monroe while completing Part II of The
   Age of Reason. Later, when he was living with the editor and publisher,
   Nicolas Bonneville, Paine was approached by Bonaparte on the prospect of
   leading a liberating army in an invasion of England. The project did not
   materialize, but seven years later, in 1804, Paine wrote a letter To The
   People of England on the Invasion of England in which he still fancied the
   idea, which was again being discussed, "as the intention of the expedition
   was to give the people of England an opportunity of forming a government
   for themselves, and thereby bring about peace."

   The world revolutionist had considerable difficulty in getting back to
   America, since Britain ruled the seas and he was a marked man. In March
   1801, Jefferson, then president, wrote Paine that a frigate would pick him
   up. Jefferson was attacked for this in America, and Paine declined the
   offer to save his friend further difficulties on this score. When the war
   between England and France ended, so that French ships were no longer
   liable to attack, Paine sailed for the United States, arriving October 30,
   1802.

   His active personal participation in the British and French revolutionary
   movements was at an end, but he continued to write pamphlets and letters,
   such as the letter to the English people mentioned above, and a series of
   Letters to the Citizens of the United States, attacking the Federalists.

   Paine was reviled by his contemporary opponents, misrepresented by writers
   who repeated their slanders later, and has been inadequately or falsely,
   depicted also by the modern liberals who have claimed to "rehabilitate"
   him. Of his contemporaries, the British opponents of American independence
   would, under ordinary circumstances, be the least important since their
   bias is clear. But many of Paine's anti-democratic attackers on this side
   of the Atlantic could find nothing better to base their slanders on than
   the interested political hack jobs written by professional propagandists
   of the British Crown, and therefore it is necessary to trace such slanders
   to their source.

   Two of the earliest hatchet jobs done on Paine, were biographies written
   by Francis Oldys, A.M., who was actually George Chalmers, a London
   government clerk, and James Cheetham, an Englishman who came to America to
   edit an anti-democratic newspaper. Chalmers' book was published in the
   heat of the controversy between Burke and Paine over the French
   Revolution.

   But Paine's revolutionary ideas made him the butt of equally vicious
   attack in America. John Adams, for example, labeled him "the filthy Tom
   Paine," an epithet that has been continued through modern times.

   The New England Palladium called Paine a "lying, drunken, brutal infidel,
   who rejoiced in the opportunity of basking and wallowing in the confusion,
   bloodshed, rapine, and murder in which his soul delights."

   More recent examples of how the early slanders affected his reputation are
   the fact that Paine's name was voted down for the Hall of Fame, where
   other Revolutionary leaders are honored; Theodore Roosevelt referred to
   him as a "filthy little atheist," and as late as 1942 the Fairmount Park
   Commission of Philadelphia refused to permit the erection of a statue of
   Paine because of his "reputed religious views."

   Paine has not fared so well at the hands of the school of "objective
   historians" or the liberals who have attempted to "rehabilitate" him,
   either.

   Curtis P. Nettels of Cornell University, in The Roots of American
   Civilization (1946) stigmatizes Paine as a "restless English adventurer in
   radicalism and idealism," and credits Common Sense, the most important
   single piece of literature for independence in the arsenal of the radicals
   of 1776, as having been "written in a rough, vigorous, flamboyant style
   that drove home with fierce blows the necessity of independence."

   W.E. Woodward, in Tom Paine: America's Godfather, (1945) finds it
   necessary to deprive him of lasting significance by stating that "Paine
   was not a radical within the meaning of that term as it is used today. He
   was an individualist."

   John C. Miller, in Triumph of Freedom, 1775-1783, (1948) says that Paine
   reversed his line of criticism of the French government before the
   revolution in that country, accepting a bribe in the form of an offer to
   serve as paid propagandist for France in America. Paine answered that
   could slander himself.

   Miller adds that Paine's irreligion was so bad that Sam Adams had to
   rebuke him for contributing to the "depravity of the younger generation."

   James Truslow Adams, in The History of New England, 1691-1776 (1941),
   repeats the condescending characterization of Common Sense: "Crude and
   coarse as it was, it was written in words of power."

   Probably the best of the liberal treatments of Paine is that of Charles
   Beard in The Rise of American Civilization, which, though sketchily, gives
   some indication of Paine's principled consistency as an outstanding
   product of his times, as one who played an important part in helping shape
   revolutionary thinking, and as a courageous fighter whose plebian insight
   gave his writing a force that none of the superficial m- apologetic
   defenders of the propertied classes could equal.

   Paine was in the vanguard of the progressive bourgeois revolution of his
   day influenced by the classical political economists such as Ferguson and
   Adam Smith, and the natural rights philosophy, he was well equipped to
   attack and refute the apologists for the status quo like Burke.

   In the Rights of Man and other works, Paine expressed the same logic and
   concreteness in his approach to labor as on other questions. "Several laws
   are in existence for regulating and limiting workmen's wages," he wrote.
   "Why not leave them as free to make their own bargains, as lawmakers are
   to let their farms and houses."

   Paine opposed monarchy, slavery, poverty, organized religion and the
   Bible, and the unequal status of women. He was an advocate of universal
   education, reform of criminal law, pensions far the aged and other social
   security measures, reduction of armaments and universal peace.

   But Paine was no meek pacifist: in writing on his proposal for reduction
   of armaments, he said that if others should refuse to disarm, he would
   take up his musket and thank God for giving him the strength to do so.
   Moreover his enlistment in the colonial army and his whole life of
   revolutionary activity belie the picture some historians paint of him as a
   Quaker pacifist.

   The explanation for the popularity of his writings, their broad mass
   appeal, is undoubtedly to be found in the fact that of all the American
   revolutionary leaders and writers, he was one who by his origin,
   background and way of life represented the plebian masses and consequently
   could consistently give more content to the democratic slogans and ideas
   of the time.

   His popularity with the masses was based on his democratic convictions.
   Sam Adams, the chief organizer of the First American Revolution, also drew
   his chief strength from reliance on the masses. That Paine was in contact
   with and worked closely with Adams is indicated in the following quotation
   from a letter to Adams dated Jan. 1, 1803:

   "I am obliged to you for your affectionate remembrance of what you style
   my services in awakening the public mind to a declaration of independence,
   and supporting it after it was declared. I also, like you, have often
   looked back on those times, and have thought that if independence had not
   been declared at the time it was, the public mind could not have been
   brought up to it afterwards.

   "It will immediately occur to you, who were so intimately acquainted with
   the situation of things at that time, that I allude to the black times of
   Seventy-six; for though I know, and you my friend also know, they were no
   other than the natural consequences of the military blunders of that
   campaign, the country might have viewed there as proceeding from a natural
   inability to support its cause against the enemy, and have sunk under the
   despondency of that misconceived idea. This was the impression against
   which it was necessary that the country should be strongly animated."

   Paine's view of himself and the revolution was clearly stated in another
   article. "I had no thought of independence or of arms" (upon arriving in
   America), he wrote.

   "The world could not then have persuaded me that I should be either a
   soldier or an author. If I had any talents for either, they were buried in
   me, and might ever have continued so, had not the necessity of the times
   dragged and driven them into action."

   But Paine's talents as a soldier and author were based on still another
   quality: he was a revolutionary thinker, honest, courageous, and prepared
   to go to the root of things. As he put it: "When precedents fail to assist
   us, we must return to the first principles of things for information, and
   think as if we were the first men that thought." That was Tom Paine,
   revolutionist.
