   No. With Franklin, Paine took part in the Society for Political Enquiries
   before the Constitutional Convention to prepare the political ground for a
   democratic constitution. But Paine was kept away from the Convention
   because of his numerous essays denouncing the bicameral approach to
   government and supporting universal suffrage, an end to slavery and
   complete democratic structures. The tide in America had turned against the
   radical principles of the Declaration of Independence, and Paine looked to
   Europe for the next tide of Revolution. He left again for Europe in the
   Spring of 1787.
