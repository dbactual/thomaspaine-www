   Daniel Moncure Conway was born of Methodist slaveholding parents and
   educated at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa., graduating in 1849.
   He entered the Methodist ministry in 1850, and later studied at the
   Harvard Divinity School. He had become imbued with rationalistic ideas
   and attempted to preach them on his return to Virginia, but was obliged to
   leave the state. While serving in the Methodist ministry he was converted
   to Unitarianism, but because of his outspoken Abolitionist views he was
   dismissed from his first Unitarian pastorate, in Washington, D.C., in
   1856. He secured another pastorate in Cincinnati, Ohio, and while there 
   wrote several volumes, and became active in Abolitionist causes,
   editing The  Dial of Cincinnati (1860-61); even settling a colony of
   fugitive slaves at Yellow Springs, Ohio. In 1862 he became co-editor in
   Boston of the anti-slavery newspaper, the Commonwealth, earnestly
   advocating emancipation. During the Civil War he went to England to
   lecture on behalf of the North explaining the causes of the Civil War,
   becoming a pastor at South Place Chapel in  London, England (1864-84,
   1892-97). He returned to America near the close of the century, and made
   his home in New York.

   Conway contributed to journals in both England and the United States and
   wrote more than 70 books and pamphlets on a great variety of subjects. His
   published books include: Demonology and Devil Lore (1879); The Wandering
   Jew (1880); Thomas Carlyle (1881); Emerson at Home  and
   Abroad (1882); George Washington and Mount Vernon; Omitted Chapters of
   History Disclosed in the Life of Edmund Randolph  (1887); Pine and Palm, a
   novel (1887); Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne(1890); Prisms of Air, a novel
   (1891); The Life of Thomas Paine, 2  vols. (1892); Barons of the Potomac
   and the Rappahannock (1892); Centenary History of South Place
   Chapel (1893); The Writings of  Thomas Paine, 4 vols. (1894-96);Solomon
   and Solomonic Literature (1899); Autobiography (1904); My Pilgrimage to
   the Wise Men of  the East (1906); Addresses and Reprints,
   1850-1907 (Boston, 1909).  His Autobiography (1904) is valuable for
   sketches of important  19th-century figures.

   Conway was elected President of the Thomas Paine National Historical
   Association, February 22, 1906 and served as its President until his
   death in November of 1907.

                            PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION

                      -----------------------------------

   IN the Preface to the first edition of this work, it was my painful duty
   to remark with severity on the dissemination of libels on Paine in a work
   of such importance as Mr. Leslie Stephen's "History of English Thought in
   the Eighteenth Century."  The necessity of doing so was impressed on me by
   the repetition of some of Mr. Stephen's unfounded disparagements in Mr. O.
   B. Frothingham's "Recollections and Impressions." I have now the
   satisfaction of introducing this edition with retractations by both of
   those authors. Mr. Frothingham, in a letter which he authorizes me to use,
   says: "Your charge is true, and I hasten to say peccavi. The truth is that
   I never made a study of Paine, but took Stephen's estimates. Now my
   mistake is clear, and I am willing to stand in the cold with nothing on
   but a hair shirt. Your vindication of Paine is complete."  Mr. Frothingham
   adds that in any future edition of his work the statements shall be
   altered. The note of Mr. Leslie Stephen appeared in The National Reformer,
   September 11, 1892, to which it was sent by a correspondent, at his
   desire; for it equally relates to strictures in a pamphlet by the editor
   of that journal, Mr. John M. Robertson. 
   The account which I gave of Paine in the book upon the Eighteenth Century
   was, I have no doubt, erroneous. My only excuse, if it be an excuse, was
   the old one, `pure ignorance.' I will not ask whether or how far the
   ignorance was excusable.

   "Mr. Conway pointed out the error in an article contributed, I think, to
   the Fortnightly Review at the time. He has, no doubt, added, since then,
   to his exposure of my (and other people's) blunders, and I hope to read
   his book soon. Meanwhile, I must state that consequence of
   the Fortnightly article, I altered the statements in the second edition of
   my book. I have no copy at hand [Mr. S. writes from the country] and
   cannot say what alterations precisely I made, though it is very possible
   that they were inadequate, as for certain reasons I was unable to attend
   properly to the revision. If a third edition should ever be required, I
   would go into the question more thoroughly. I have since that time read
   some letters on Paine contributed by Mr. Conway to the New York Nation. I
   had seen the announcement of his new publication, and had made up my mind
   to take the first opportunity of going into the question again with Mr.
   Conway's additional information. I hope that I may be able to write
   Paine's life for the Dictionary of National Biography, and if so, shall
   have the best opportunity for putting on record my final judgment. It will
   be a great pleasure to me if I find, as I expect to find, that he was
   greatly maligned, and to make some redress for my previous misguided
   remarks."

   It is indeed to be hoped that Mr. Stephen will write the Life in the
   Dictionary, whose list of subjects for the coming volume, inserted in
   the Athenaeum since his above retraction, designates Thomas Paine as an
   "infidel" writer. Mr. Stephen can do much to terminate the carefully
   fostered ignorance of which he has found himself a victim. In advance of
   his further treatment of the subject, and with perfect confidence in his
   justice, I here place by the side of my original criticism a retraction of
   anything that may seem to include him among authors who have shown a lack
   of magnanimity towards Paine.

   The general statement (First Preface, p. xvi) must, however, remain; for
   recent discussions reveal a few unorthodox writers willing to throw, or to
   leave, "a traditionally hated head to the orthodox mob." On the other
   hand, some apology is due for this phrase. No orthodox mob is found. Here
   and there some halloo of the old Paine hunt is heard dying away in the
   distance, but the conservative religious and political press, American and
   English, has generally revised the traditional notions, and estimated the
   evidence with substantial justice. Nearly all of the most influential
   journals have dealt with the evidence submitted; their articles have been
   carefully read by me, and in very few are the old prejudices against Paine
   discoverable. Were these estimates of Paine collected with those of former
   times the volume would measure this century's advance in political
   liberty, and religious civilization.

   My occasionally polemical treatment of the subject has been regretted by
   several reviewers, but its necessity, I submit, is the thing to be
   regretted. Being satisfied that Paine was not merely an interesting
   figure, but that a faithful investigation of his life would bring to light
   important facts of history, I found it impossible to deal with him as an
   ordinary subject of inquiry. It were vain to try and persuade people to
   take seriously a man tarred, feathered, pilloried, pelted. It was not
   whitewashing Paine needed, but removal of the pitch, and release from the
   pillory. There must first of all be an appeal against such sentence. And
   because the wrongs represented a league of prejudices, the pleadings had
   to be in several tribunals -- moral, religious, political, social, --
   before the man could be seen at all, much less accorded the attention
   necessary for disclosure of the history suppressed through his
   degradation. Paine's personal vindication would still have required only a
   pamphlet, but that it was ancillary to the historic revelations which
   constitute the larger part of this work. A wiser writer unless too wise to
   touch Paine at all -- might have concealed such sympathies as those
   pervading this biography; but where sympathies exist the reader is
   entitled to know them, and the author subjects himself to a severer
   self-criticism if only in view of the vigilance he must excite. I have no
   feeling towards Paine inconsistent with recognition of his faults and
   errors. My vindication of him has been the production of evidence that
   removed my own early and baseless prejudices, and rendered it possible for
   me to study his career genuinely, so that others might do the same. The
   phantasmal Paine cleared away, my polemic ends. I have endeavored to
   portray the real Paine, and have brought to light some things unfavorable
   to him which his enemies had not discovered, and, I believe, could never
   have discovered.

   The errata in the first edition are few and of slight importance. I wish
   to retract a suggestion made in my apology for Washington which I have
   discovered to be erroneous. It was suggested (vol. ii., pp. 173 and 382)
   that Washington's failure to answer Paine's private letter of September
   20, 1795, asking an explanation of his neglect while he (Paine) was in
   prison and his life in peril, may have been due to its interception by
   Pickering (who had by a suppression of documents sealed the sad fate of
   his predecessor in office, Edmund Randolph). I have, however, discovered
   that Paine's letter did reach Washington.

   I would be glad if my own investigations, continued while preparing an
   edition of Paine's works, or any of my reviewers, had enabled me to
   relieve the shades with which certain famous names are touched by
   documentary acts in this history. The publication of those relating to
   Gouverneur Morris, while American Minister in France, was for personal
   reasons especially painful to myself. Though such publication was not of
   any importance to Paine's reputation, it was essential to a fair judgment
   of others -- especially of Washington, -- and to any clear comprehension
   of the relations between France and the United States at that period. As
   the correspondence between Gouverneur Morris and the French Minister
   concerning Paine, after his imprisonment, is in French, and the originals
   (in Paris) are not easily accessible to American and English readers, I
   have concluded to copy them here.

   A Paris le 14 fevrier 1794

   26 pluviose.

   Le Ministre plenipotentiaire des Etats Unis de l'Amerique pres la
   Republique franc,aise au Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres.

   Monsieur:

   Thomas Paine vient de s'addresser `a moi pour que je le reclame comme
   Citoyen des Etats Unis. Voici (je crois) les Faits que le regardent. Il
   est ne en Angleterre. Devenu ensuite Citoyen des Etats Unis il s'y est
   acquise une grande celebrite par des Ecrits revolutionnaires. En
   consequence il fut adopte Citoyen franc,ais et ensuite elu membre de la
   Convention. Sa conduite depuis cette Epoque n'est pas de mon ressort.
   J'ignore la cause de sa Detention actuelle dans la prison du Luxembourg,
   mais je vous prie Monsieur (si des raisons qui ne me sont pas connues
   s'opposent `a sa liberation) de vouloirbien m'en instruire pour que je
   puisse les communiquer au Gouvernement des Etats Unis.

   J'ai l'honneur d'etre, Monsieur,

   Votre tres humble Serviteur,

   Gouv. MORRIS. 
     
   Paris, 1 Ventose l'An 2d de la Republic une et indivisible.

   Le ministre des Affaires Etrangeres au Ministre Plenipotentiaire des Etats
   Unis de l'Amerique pres la Republique Franc,aise.

   Par votre lettre du 26 du mois dernier, vous reclamez la liberte de Thomas
   Paine, comme Citoyen americain. Ne en Angleterre, cet ex-depute est devenu
   successivement Citoyen Americain et Citoyen franc,ais. En acceptant ce
   dernier titre et en remplissant une place dans le corps legislatif, il
   s'est soumis aux lois de la Republique et il a renonce de fait `a la
   protection que le droit des gens et les traites conclus avec les Etats
   Unis auraient pu lui assurer.

   J'ignore les motifs de sa detention mais je dois presumer qu'ils sont bien
   fondes. Je vais neanmoins soumettre au Comite de Salut public la demande
   que vous m'avez adressee et je m'empresserai de vous faire connaitre sa
   decision.

   DEFORGIUES.

   The translations of these letters are on page 120, vol. ii., of this work.
   No other letters on the subject between these Ministers are known. The
   reader may judge whether there is anything in the American Minister's
   application to warrant the opening assertion in that of Deforgues. Morris
   forwarded the latter to his government, withheld his application, of which
   no copy exists in the State Archives at Washington.

                                    PREFACE

   AT Hornsey, England, I saw a small square mahogany table, bearing at its
   centre the following words: "This Plate is inscribed by Thos. Clio Rickman
   in Remembrance of his dear friend Thomas Paine, who on this table in the
   year 1792 wrote several of his invaluable Works."

   The works written by Paine in Rickman's house were the second part of "The
   Rights of Man," and "A Letter to the Addressers." Of these two books vast
   numbers were circulated, and though the government prosecuted them, they
   probably contributed largely to make political progress in England
   evolutionary instead of revolutionary. On this table he set forth
   constitutional reforms that might be peacefully obtained, and which have
   been substantially obtained. And here he warned the "Addressers,"
   petitioning the throne for suppression of his works "It is dangerous in
   any government to say to a nation, Thou shall not read. This is now done
   in Spain, and was formerly done under the old government of France; but it
   served to procure the downfall of the latter, and is subverting that of
   the former; and it will have the same tendency in all countries; because
   Thought, by some means or other, is got abroad in the world, and cannot be
   restrained, though reading may."

   At this table the Quaker chieftain, whom Danton rallied for hoping to make
   revolutions with rosewater, unsheathed his pen and animated his Round
   Table of Reformers for a conflict free from the bloodshed he had witnessed
   in America, and saw threatening France. This little table was the field
   chosen for the battle of free speech; its abundant ink-spots were the shed
   blood of hearts transfused with humanity. I do not wonder that Rickman was
   wont to show the table to his visitors, or hat its present owner, Edward
   Truelove -- a bookseller who has suffered imprisonment for selling
   proscribed books, -- should regard it with reverence.

   The table is what was once called a candle-stand, and there stood on it,
   in my vision, Paine's clear, honest candle, lit from his "inner light,"
   now covered by a bushel of prejudice. I myself had once supposed his light
   an infernal torch; now I sat at the ink-spotted candle-stand to write the
   first page of this history, for which I can invoke nothing higher than the
   justice that inspired what Thomas Paine here wrote.

   The educated ignorance concerning Paine is astounding. I once heard an
   English prelate speak of "the vulgar atheism of Paine." Paine founded the
   first theistic society in Christendom; his will closes with the words, "I
   die in perfect composure, and resignation to the will of my Creator,
   God." But what can be expected of an English prelate when an historian
   like Jared Sparks, an old Unitarian minister, could suggest that a letter
   written by Franklin, to persuade some one not to publish a certain attack
   on religion, was "probably" addressed to Paine.
   (Franklin's "Writings," vol. x., p. 281.)   Paine never wrote a page that
   Franklin could have so regarded, nor anything in the way of religious
   controversy until three years after Franklin's death. "The remarks in the
   above letter," says Sparks, "are strictly applicable to the deistical
   writings which Paine afterwards published." On the contrary, they are
   strictly inapplicable. They imply that the writer had denied a "particular
   providence," which Paine never denied, and it is asked, "If men are so
   wicked with religion, what would they be without it?"   Paine's "deism"
   differed from Franklin's only in being more fervently religious. No one
   who had really read Paine could imagine the above question addressed to
   the author to whom the Bishop of Llandaff wrote: "There is a philosophical
   sublimity in some of your ideas when speaking of the Creator of the
   Universe." The reader may observe at work, in this example, the tiny
   builder, prejudice, which has produced the large formation of Paine
   mythology. Sparks, having got his notion of Paine's religion at
   second-hand, becomes unwittingly a weighty authority for those who have a
   case to make out. The American Tract Society published a tract
   entitled "Don't Unchain the Tiger," in which it is said: "When an infidel
   production was submitted -- probably by Paine -- to Benjamin Franklin, in
   manuscript, he returned it to the author, with a letter from which the
   following is extracted: `I would advise you not to attempt unchaining the
   Tiger, but to burn this piece before it is seen by any other person." Thus
   our Homer of American history nods, and a tract floats through the world
   misrepresenting both Paine and Franklin, whose rebuke is turned from some
   anti-religious essay against his own convictions. Having enjoyed the
   personal friendship of Mr. Sparks, while at college, and known his charity
   to all opinions, I feel certain that he was an unconscious victim of the
   Paine mythology to which he added. His own creed was, in essence, little
   different from Paine's. But how many good, and even liberal, people will
   find by the facts disclosed in this volume that they have been accepting
   the Paine mythology and contributing to it? It is a notable fact that the
   most effective distortions of Paine's character and work have proceeded
   from unorthodox writers -- some of whom seem not above throwing a
   traditionally hated head to the orthodox mob. A recent instance is the
   account given of Paine in Leslie Stephen's "History of English Thought in
   the Eighteenth Century." On its appearance I recognized the old effigy of
   Paine elaborately constructed by Oldys and Cheetham, and while writing a
   paper on the subject (Fortnightly Review, March, 1879) discovered that
   those libels were the only "biographies" of Paine in the London Library,
   which (as I knew) was used by Mr. Stephen. The result was a serious
   miscarriage of historical and literary justice. In his second edition Mr.
   Stephen adds that the portrait presented "is drawn by an enemy," but on
   this Mr. Robertson pertinently asks why it was allowed to stand? ("Thomas
   Paine: an Investigation," by John M. Robertson, London, 1888). Mr.
   Stephen, eminent as an agnostic and editor of a biographical dictionary,
   is assumed to be competent, and his disparagements of a fellow heretic
   necessitated by verified facts. His scholarly style has given new lease to
   vulgar slanders. Some who had discovered their untruth, as uttered by
   Paine's personal enemies, have taken them back on Mr. Stephen's authority.
   Even brave O. B. Frothingham, in his high estimate of Paine, introduces
   one or two of Mr. Stephen's depreciations (Frothingham's "Recollection and
   Impressions," 1891).

   There has been a sad absence of magnanimity among eminent historians and
   scholars in dealing with Paine. The vignette in Oldys -- Paine with
   his "Rights of Man" preaching to apes; -- the Tract Society's picture of
   Paine's death-bed -- hair on end, grasping a bottle, -- might have excited
   their inquiry. Goethe, seeing Spinoza's face demonized in a tract, was
   moved to studies of that philosopher which ended in recognition of his
   greatness. (The chivalry of Goethe is indeed almost as rare as his genius,
   but one might have expected in students of history an historic instinct
   keen enough to suspect in the real Paine some proportion to his monumental
   mythology, and the pyramidal cairn of curses covering his grave. What
   other last-century writer on political and religious issues survives in
   the hatred and devotion of a time engaged with new problems?   What power
   is confessed in that writer who was set in the place of a decadent Satan,
   hostility to him being a sort of sixth point of Calvinism, and fortieth
   article of the Church? Large indeed must have been the influence of a man
   still perennially denounced by sectarians after heretical progress has
   left him comparatively orthodox, and retained as the figure-head of
   "Freethought" after his theism has been abandoned by its leaders.

   "Religion," said Paine, "has two principal enemies, Fanaticism and
   Infidelity." It was his strange destiny to be made a battle-field between
   these enemies. In the smoke of the conflict the man has been hidden. In
   the catalogue of the British Museum Library I counted 327 entries of books
   by or concerning Thomas Paine, who in most of them is a man-shaped or
   devil-shaped shuttlecock tossed between fanatical and "infidel" rackets.

   Here surely were phenomena enough to attract the historic sense of a
   scientific age, yet they are counterpart of an historic suppression of the
   most famous author of his time. The meager references to Paine by other
   than controversial writers are perfunctory; by most historians he is
   either wronged or ignored. Before me are two histories of "American
   Slavery" by eminent members of Congress; neither mentions that Paine was
   the first political writer who advocated and devised a scheme of
   emancipation. Here is the latest "Life of Washington" (1889), by another
   member of Congress, who manages to exclude even the name of the man who,
   as we shall see, chiefly converted Washington to the cause of
   independence. And here is a history of the "American Revolution"(1891), by
   John Fiske, who, while recognizing the effect of "Common Sense," reveals
   his ignorance of that pamphlet, and of all Paine's works, by describing it
   as full of scurrilous abuse of the English people, -- whom Paine regarded
   as fellow-sufferers with the Americans under royal despotism.

   It may be said for these contemporaries that the task of sifting out the
   facts about Paine was formidable. The intimidated historians of the last
   generation, passing by this famous figure, left an historic vacuum, which
   has been filled with mingled fact and fable to an extent hardly manageable
   by any not prepared to give some years to the task. Our historians, might,
   however, have read Paine's works, which are rather historical documents
   than literary productions. None of them seem to have done this, and the
   omission appears in many a flaw in their works. The reader of some
   documents in this volume, left until now to slumber in accessible
   archives, will get some idea of the cost to historic truth of this long
   timidity and negligence. But some of the results are more deplorable and
   irreparable, and one of these must here be disclosed.

   In 1802 an English friend of Paine, Redman Yorke, visited him in Paris. In
   a letter written at the time Yorke states that Paine had for some time
   been preparing memoirs of his own life, and his correspondence, and showed
   him two volumes of the same. In a letter of Jan. 25, 1805, to Jefferson,
   Paine speaks of his wish to publish his works, which will make, with his
   manuscripts, five octavo volumes of four hundred pages each. Besides which
   he means to publish "a miscellaneous volume of correspondence, essays, and
   some pieces of poetry." He had also, he says, prepared historical
   prefaces, stating the circumstances under which each work was written. All
   of which confirms Yorke's statement, and shows that Paine had prepared at
   least two volumes of autobiographic matter and correspondence. Paine never
   carried out the design mentioned to Jefferson, and his manuscripts passed
   by bequest to Madame Bonneville. This lady, after Paine's death, published
   a fragment of Paine's third part of "The Age of Reason," but it was
   afterwards found that she had erased passages that might offend the
   orthodox. Madame Bonneville returned to her husband in Paris, and the
   French "Biographical Dictionary" states that in 1829 she, as the
   depositary of Paine's papers, began "editing" his life. This, which could
   only have been the autobiography, was never published. She had become a
   Roman Catholic. On returning (1833) to America, where her son, General
   Bonneville, also a Catholic, was in military service, she had personal as
   well as religious reasons for suppressing the memoirs. She might naturally
   have feared the revival of an old scandal concerning her relations with
   Paine. The same motives may have prevented her son from publishing Paine's
   memoirs and manuscripts. Madame Bonneville died at the house of the
   General, in St. Louis. I have a note from his widow, Mrs. Sue Bonneville,
   in which she says: "The papers you speak of regarding Thomas Paine are all
   destroyed -- at least all which the General had in his possession. On his
   leaving St. Louis for an indefinite time all his effects -- a handsome
   library and valuable papers included were stored away, and during his
   absence the storehouse burned down, and all that the General stored away
   were burned."

   There can be little doubt that among these papers burned in St. Louis were
   the two volumes of Paine's autobiography and correspondence seen by Redman
   Yorke in 1802. Even a slight acquaintance with Paine's career would enable
   one to recognize this as a catastrophe. No man was more intimately
   acquainted with the inside history of the revolutionary movement, or so
   competent to record it. Franklin had deposited with him his notes and
   papers concerning the American Revolution. He was the only Girondist who
   survived the French Revolution who was able to tell their secret history.
   His personal acquaintance included nearly every great or famous man of his
   time, in England, America, France. From this witness must have come
   testimonies, facts, anecdotes, not to be derived from other sources,
   concerning Franklin, Goldsmith, Ferguson, Rittenhouse, Rush, Fulton,
   Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, the Adamses, Lees, Morrises, Condorcet,
   Vergennes, Sieyes, Lafayette, Danton, Genet, Brissot, Robespierre, Marat,
   Burke, Erskine, and a hundred others. All this, and probably invaluable
   letters from these men, have been lost through the timidity of a woman
   before the theological "boycott" on the memory of a theist, and the
   indifference of this country to its most important materials of History.

   When I undertook the biography of Edmund Randolph I found that the great
   mass of his correspondence had been similarly destroyed by fire in New
   Orleans, and probably a like fate will befall the Madison papers, Monroe
   papers, and others, our national neglect of which will appear criminal to
   posterity. After searching through six States to gather documents
   concerning Randolph which should all have been in Washington City, the
   writer petitioned the Library Committee of Congress to initiate some
   action towards the preservation of our historical manuscripts. The
   Committee promptly and unanimously approved the proposal, a definite
   scheme was reported by the Librarian of Congress, and -- there the matter
   rests. As the plan does not include any device for advancing partisan
   interests, it stands a fair chance of remaining in our
   national oubliette of intellectual desiderata.

   In writing the "Life of Paine" I have not been saved much labor by
   predecessors in the same field. They have all been rather controversial
   pamphleteers than biographers, and I have been unable to accept any of
   their statements without verification. They have been useful, however, in
   pointing out regions of inquiry, and several of them -- Rickman, Sherwin,
   Linton -- contain valuable citations from contemporary papers. The truest
   delineation of Paine is the biographical sketch by his friend Rickman.
   The "Life" by Vale, and sketches by Richard Carlile, Blanchard, and
   others, belong to the controversial collectanea in which Paine's
   posthumous career is traceable. The hostile accounts of Paine, chiefly
   found in tracts and encyclopaedias, are mere repetitions of those written
   by George Chalmers and James Cheetham.

   The first of these was published in 1791 under the title: "The Life of
   Thomas Pain, Author of 'The Rights of Men,' with a Defence of his
   Writings. By Francis Oldys, A.M., of the University of Pennsylvania.
   London. Printed for John Stockdale, Pickadilly." This writer, who begins
   his vivisection of Paine by accusing him of adding "e" to his name,
   assumed in his own case an imposing pseudonym. George Chalmers never had
   any connection with the University of Philadelphia, nor any such degree.
   Sherwin (1819) states that Chalmers admitted having received -L-500 from
   Lord Hawksbury, in whose bureau he was a clerk, for writing the book; but
   though I can find no denial of this I cannot verify it. In his later
   editions the author claims that his book had checked the influence of
   Paine, then in England, and his "Rights of Man," which gave the government
   such alarm that subsidies were paid several journals to counteract their
   effect. (See the letter of Freching, cited from the Vansitart
   Papers, British Museum, by W. H. Smith, in the Century, August, 1891.)  
   It is noticeable that Oldys, in his first edition, entitles his work
   a "Defence" of Paine's writings -- a trick which no doubt carried this
   elaborate libel into the hands of many "Paineites." The third edition
   has, With a Review of his Writings." In a later edition we find the
   vignette of Paine surrounded by apes. Cobbett's biographer, Edward Smith,
   describes the book as "one of the most horrible collections of abuse which
   even that venal day produced." The work was indeed so overweighted with
   venom that it was sinking into oblivion when Cobbett reproduced its libels
   in America, for which he did penance through many years. My reader will
   perceive, in the earlier chapters of this work, that Chalmers tracked
   Paine in England with enterprise, but there were few facts that he did not
   manage to twist into his strand of slander.

   In 1809, not long after Paine's death, James Cheetham's "Life of Thomas
   Paine " appeared in New York. Cheetham had been a hatter in Manchester,
   England, and would probably have continued in that respectable occupation
   had it not been for Paine. When Paine visited England and there
   published "The Rights of Man" Cheetham became one of his idolaters, took
   to political writing, and presently emigrated to America. He became editor
   of The American Citizen, in New York. The cause of Cheetham's enmity to
   Paine was the discovery by the latter that he was betraying the
   Jeffersonian party while his paper was enjoying its official patronage.
   His exposure of the editor was remorseless; the editor replied with
   personal vituperation; and Paine was about instituting a suit for libel
   when he died. Of Cheetham's ingenuity in falsehood one or two specimens
   may be given. During Paine's trial in London, for writing "The Rights of
   Man," a hostile witness gave testimony which the judge pronounced
   "impertinent"; Cheetham prints it "important."   He says that Madame de
   Bonneville accompanied Paine on his return from France in 1802; she did
   not arrive until a year later. He says that when Paine was near his end
   Monroe wrote asking him to acknowledge a debt for money loaned in Paris,
   and that Paine made no reply. But before me is Monroe's statement, while
   President, that for his advances to Paine "no claim was ever presented on
   my part, nor is any indemnity now desired." Cheetham's book is one of the
   most malicious ever written, and nothing in it can be trusted.

   Having proposed to myself to write a critical and impartial history of the
   man and his career, I found the vast Paine literature, however interesting
   as a shadow measuring him who cast it, containing conventionalized
   effigies of the man as evolved by friend and foe in their long struggle.
   But that war has ended among educated people. In the laborious work of
   searching out the real Paine I have found a general appreciation of its
   importance, and it will be seen in the following pages that generous
   assistance has been rendered by English clergymen, by official persons in
   Europe and America, by persons of all beliefs and no beliefs. In no
   instance have I been impeded by any prejudice, religious or political. The
   curators of archives, private collectors, owners of important documents
   bearing on the subject, have welcomed my effort to bring the truth to
   light. The mass of material thus accumulated is great, and its compression
   has been a difficult task. But the interest that led me to the subject has
   increased at every step; the story has abounded in thrilling episodes and
   dramatic surprises; and I have proceeded with a growing conviction that
   the simple facts, dispassionately told, would prove of importance far
   wider than Paine's personality, and find welcome with all students of
   history. I have brought to my task a love for it, the studies of some
   years, and results of personal researches made in Europe and America:
   qualifications which I count less than another which I venture to claim --
   the sense of responsibility, acquired by a public teacher of long service,
   for his words, which, be they truths or errors, take on life, and work
   their good or evil to all generations.

                        Footnotes at the end of Volume I

                                   CHAPTER  I

                               EARLY INFLUENCES 
                                  [1736-1756]

   THE history here undertaken is that of an English mechanic, of Quaker
   training, caught in political cyclones of the last century, and set at the
   centre of its revolutions, in the old world and the new.

   In the church register of Euston Parish, near Thetford, England, occurs
   this entry: "1734. Joseph Pain and Frances Cocke were married June 20th."
   These were the parents of Thomas Paine. The present rector of Euston
   Church, Lord Charles Fitz Roy, tells me that the name is there plainly
   "Pain," but in the Thetford town-records of that time it is officially
   entered "Joseph Paine."

   Paine and Cocke are distinguished names in the history of Norfolk County.
   In, the sixteenth century Newhall Manor, on the road between Thetford and
   Norwich, belonged to a Paine family. In 1553 Thomas Paine Gent., was, by
   license from Queen Mary, trustee for the Lady Elizabeth, daughter of Henry
   VIII., by Queen Anne Bullen. In St. Thomas Church, Norwich, stands the
   monument of Sir Joseph Paine, Knt., the most famous mayor and benefactor
   of that city in the seventeenth century. In St. John the Baptist Church is
   the memorial of justice Francis Cocke (d. 1628). Whether our later Joseph
   and Thomas were related to these earlier Paines has not been ascertained,
   but Mr. E. Chester Waters, of London, an antiquarian especially learned in
   family histories, expressed to me his belief that the Norfolk County
   Paines are of one stock.

   There is equal probability that John Cocke, Deputy Recorder of Thetford in
   1629, pretty certainly ancestor of Thomas Paine's mother, was related to
   Richard Cock, of Norwich, author of "English Law, or a Summary Survey of
   the Household of God upon Earth " (London, 1651). The author of "The
   Rights of Man" may therefore be a confutation of his own dictum: "An
   hereditary governor is as inconsistent as an hereditary author." One
   Thomas Payne, of the Norfolk County family, was awarded -L-20 by the
   Council of State (1650) "for his sufferings by printing a book for the
   cause of Parliament." Among the sequestrators of royalist church livings
   was Charles George Cock, "student of Christian Law, of the Society of the
   Inner Temple, now [1651] resident of Norwich." In Blomefield's "History of
   Norfolk County" other notes may be found suggesting that whatever may have
   been our author's genealogy he was spiritually descended from these old
   radicals.

   At Thetford I explored a manuscript -- "Freeman's Register
   Book" (1610-1756) -- and found that Joseph Paine (our author's father) was
   made a freeman of Thetford April 18, 1737, and Henry Cock May 16, 1740.
   The freemen of this borough were then usually respectable tradesmen. Their
   privileges amounted to little more than the right of pasturage on the
   commons. The appointment did not imply high position, but popularity and
   influence. Frances Cocke had no doubt resided in Euston Parish, where she
   was married. She was a member of the Church of England and daughter of an
   attorney of Thetford. Her husband was a Quaker and is said to have been
   disowned by the Society of Friends for being married by a priest. A search
   made for me by official members of that Society in Norfolk County failed
   to discover either the membership or disownment of any one of the name.
   Joseph's father, a farmer, was probably a Quaker. Had the son (b. 1708)
   been a Quaker by conversion he would hardly have defied the rules of the
   Society at twenty-six.

   Joseph was eleven years younger than his wife. According to Oldys he was
   "a reputable citizen and though poor an honest man," but his wife was "a
   woman of sour temper and an eccentric character." Thomas Paine's writings
   contain several affectionate allusions to his father, but none to his
   mother. "They say best men are moulded out of faults," and the moulding
   begins before birth.

   Thomas Paine was born January 29, 1736-7, at Thetford. The plain brick
   house was in Bridge Street (now White Hart) and has recently made way for
   a pretty garden. I was inclined to adopt a more picturesque tradition that
   the birthplace was in old Heathenman Street, as more appropriate for a
   paien (no doubt the origin of Paine's name), who also bore the name of the
   doubting disciple. An appeal for allowances might be based on such a
   conjunction of auspices, but a manuscript of Paine's friend Rickman, just
   found by Dr. Clair J. Grece, identifies the house beyond question.

   Thomas Paine is said by most of his biographers to have never been
   baptized. This rests solely on a statement by Oldys: 

   "It arose probably from the tenets of the father, and from the
   eccentricity of the mother, that our author was never baptized, though he
   was privately named; and never received, like true Christians, into the
   bosom of any church, though he was indeed confirmed by the bishop of
   Norwich: This last circumstance was owing to the orthodox zeal of Mistress
   Cocke, his aunt, a woman of such goodness, that though she lived on a
   small annuity, she imparted much of this little to his mother.

   "As he was not baptized, the baptism of Thomas Pain is not entered on the
   parish books of Thetford. It is a remarkable fact, that the leaves of the
   two registers of the parishes of St. Cuthbert's and St. Peter's, in
   Thetford, containing the marriages, births, and burials, from the end of
   1733, to the beginning of 1737, have been completely cut out. Thus, a
   felony has been committed against the public, and an injury done to
   individuals, by a hand very malicious and wholly unknown. Whether our
   author, when he resided in Thetford in 1787, looked into these registers
   for his own birth;   what he saw, or what he did, we will not conjecture.
   They contain the baptism of his sister Elizabeth, on the 28th of August,
   1738."
   This is Oldysian. Of course, if there was any mischief Paine did it,
   albeit against his own interests. But a recent examination shows that
   there has been no mutilation of the registers. St. Peter's and St.
   Cuthbert's had at the time one minister. In 1736, just before Paine's
   birth, the minister (John Price) died, and his successor (Thomas Vaughan)
   appears to have entered on his duties in March, 1737. A little before and
   during this interregnum the registers were neglected. In St. Cuthbert's
   register is the entry: Elizabeth, Daughter of Joseph Payne and Frances is
   wife of this parish, was born Aug't the 29th, 1738, baptized September ye
   20, 1738." This (which Oldys has got inaccurately, suo more) renders it
   probable that Thomas Paine was also baptized. Indeed, he would hardly have
   been confirmed otherwise.

   The old historian of Norfolk County, Francis Blomefield, introduces us to
   Thetford (Sitomagus, Tedford, Theford, "People of the Ford") with a strain
   of poetry:

   "No situation but may envy thee, 
    Holding such intimacy with the sea, 
    Many do that, but my delighted muse 
    Says, Neptune's fairest daughter is the Little Ouse."
   After reading, Blomefield's history of the ancient town, and that of
   Martin, and after strolling through the quaint streets, I thought some
   poet should add to this praise for picturesqueness some tribute on
   Thetford's historic vistas. There is indeed "a beauty buried everywhere,"
   as Browning says.

   Evelyn, visiting his friend Lord Arlington at Euston in September, 1677,
   writes: 

   "I went to Thetford, the Burrough Towne, where stand the ruines of a
   religious house; there is a round mountaine artificially raised, either
   for some castle or monument, which, makes a pretty landscape. As we went
   and return'd, a tumbler shew'd his extraordinary addresse in the Warren. I
   also saw the Decoy, much pleas'd with the stratagem."

   Evelyn leaves his own figure, his princely friends, and the tumbler in the
   foreground of "a pretty landscape" visible to the antiquarian all around
   Thetford, whose roads, fully followed, would lead past the great scenes of
   English history. In general appearance the town (population under five
   thousand) conveys the pleasant impression of a fairly composite picture of
   its eras and generations. There is a continuity between the old Grammar
   School, occupying the site of the ancient cathedral, and a new Mechanics'
   Institute in the old Guildhall. The old churches summon their flocks from
   eccentric streets suggestive of literal sheep-paths. Of the ignorance with
   which our democratic age sweeps away as cobwebs fine threads woven by the
   past around the present,   Thetford showed few signs, but it is sad to
   find "Guildhall " effacing "Heathenman" Street, which pointed across a
   thousand years to the march of the "heathen men" (Danes) of Anglo-Saxon
   chronicles.

   "A. 870. This year the (heathen army rode across Mercia into East Anglia,
   and took up their winter quarters in Thetford; and the same winter King
   Edmund fought against them, and the Danes got the victory, and slew the
   king, and subdued all the land, and destroyed all the ministers which they
   came to. The names of their chiefs who slew the king were Hingwar and
   Habba."
   If old Heathenman Street be followed historically, it would lead to Bury
   St. Edmunds, where, on the spot of his coronation, the young king "was
   placed in a goodly shrine, richly adorned with jewels and precious
   stones," and a royal saint added to the calendar. The blood of St. Edmund
   reconsecrated Thetford.

   "A. 1094. Then at Candlemas the king [William Rufus] went to Hastings, and
   whilst he waited there for a fair wind he caused the monastery, on the
   field of battle to be consecrated; and he took the staff from Herbert
   Losange, bishop of Thetford."
   The letters of this Bishop Herbert, discovered at Brussels, give him an
   honorable place in the list of Thetford authors; wherein also occur the
   names of Richard of Thetford, author of a treatise on preaching, Jeffrey
   de Rocherio, who began a history of the monarchy, and John Brame, writer
   and translator of various treatises. The works of these Thetford authors
   are preserved at Cambridge, England.

   Thetford was, in a way, connected with the first newspaper enterprise. Its
   member of Parliament, Sir Joseph Williamson, edited the London Gazette,
   established by the Crown to support its own policy. The Crown claimed the
   sole right to issue any journal, and its license was necessary for every
   book. In 1674 Sir Joseph, being Secretary of State (he bought the office
   for -L-5,000), had control of the Gazette and of literature. In that year,
   when Milton died, his treatise on "Christian Doctrine" was brought to
   Williamson for license. He said he could "countenance nothing of Milton's
   writings," and the treatise was locked up by this first English editor, to
   be discovered a hundred and forty-nine years later.

   On his way to the Grammar School (founded by bequest of Sir Richard
   Fulmerston, 1566) Paine might daily read an inscription set in the
   Fulmerston almshouse wall: "Follow peace and holines with all men without
   the which no man shall see the Lord." But many memorials would remindhim
   of how Williamson, a poor rector's son, had sold his talent to a political
   lord and reached power to buy and sell Cabinet offices, while suppressing
   Milton. Thomas Paine, with more talent than Williamson to dispose of, was
   born in a time semi-barbaric at its best, and savage at its worst. Having
   got in the Quaker meeting an old head on his young shoulders, he must bear
   about a burden against most things around him. The old churches were
   satanic steeple-houses, and if he strolled over to that in which his
   parents were married, at Euston, its new splendors were accused by
   surrounding squalor.

   Mr. F. H. Millington of Thetford, who has told Williamson's story1, has
   made for me a search into Paine's time there.  

   "In Paine's boyhood [says Mr. Millington in a letter I have from him] the
   town (about 2,000 inhabitants) possessed a corporation with mayor,
   aldermen, sword-bearers, macemen, recorder. The corporation was a corrupt
   body, under the dominance of the Duke of Grafton, a prominent member of
   the Whig government. Both members of Parliament (Hon. C. Fitzroy, and Lord
   Augustus Fitzroy) were nominees of Gafton. The people had no interest and
   no power, and I do not think politics were of any account in Paine's
   childhood. From Paine's `Rights of Man' (Part ii., p. 108) it is clear
   that his native town was the model in his mind when he wrote on charters
   and corporations. The Lent Assizes for the Eastern Circuit were held here,
   and Paine would be familiar with the procedure and pomp of a court of
   justice. He would also be familiar with the sight of men and women hung
   for trivial offences. Thetford was on the main road to London, and was a
   posting centre. Paine would be familiar with the faces and equipages of
   some of the great Whig nobles in Norfolk. Walpole might pass through on
   his way to Houghton. The river Ouse was navigable to Lynn, and Paine would
   probably go on a barge to that flourishing seaport. Bury St. Edmunds was a
   provincial capital for the nobility and gentry of the district. It was
   twelve miles from Thetford, and in closest connection with it. The
   religious life of Thetford would be quiet. The churches were poor, having
   been robbed at the reformation. The Quakers were the only non-conformists
   in the town. There is a tradition that Wesley visited the town; if he did
   Paine would no doubt be among his hearers. On the whole, I think it easy
   to trace in Paine's works the influence of his boyhood here. He would see
   the corrupting influence of the aristocracy, the pomp of law, the evils of
   the unreformed corporations; the ruins of great ecclesiastical
   establishments, much more perfect than now, would bring to his mind what a
   power the church had been. Being of a mechanical turn of mind no doubt he
   had often played about the paper-mill which was, and is, worked by
   water-power."
   When Paine was a lad the grand gentlemen who purloined parks and mansions
   from the Treasury were sending children to the gallows for small thefts
   instigated by hunger. In his thirteenth year he might have seen under the
   shadow of Ely Minster, in that region, the execution of Amy Hutchinson,
   aged seventeen, for poisoning her husband. "Her face and hands were
   smeared with tar, and having a garment daubed with pitch, after a short
   prayer the executioner strangled her, and twenty minutes after the fire
   was kindled and burnt half an hour." (Notes and Queries, 27 September,
   1873.) Against the prevailing savagery a human protest was rarely heard
   outside the Quaker meeting. Whether disowned or not, Paine's father
   remained a Quaker, and is so registered at burial; and his eminent son has
   repeatedly mentioned his own training in the principles of that Society.
   Remembering the extent to which Paine's Quakerism had influenced his
   political theories, and instances of their bearing on great events, I
   found something impressive in the little meetinghouse in Cage Lane,
   Thetford. This was his more important birthplace. Its small windows and
   one door open on the tombless graveyard at the back, -- perhaps that they
   might not be smashed by the mob, or admit the ribaldry of the street. The
   interior is hardly large enough to seat fifty people: Plymouth Brethren
   have for some years occupied the place, but I was told that the
   congregation, reduced to four or five, would soon cease to gather there.
   Adjoining the meetinghouse, and in contact with it, stands the ancient
   Cage, which still remains to explain the name "Cage Lane." In its front
   are two arches, once iron-grated; at one stood the pillory, at the other
   the stocks, -- the latter remembered by some now living.

   On "first day," when his schoolmates went in fine clothes to grand
   churches, to see gay people, and hear fine music, little Thomas, dressed
   in drab, crept affrighted past the stocks to his childhood's pillory in
   the dismal meeting-house. For him no beauty or mirth, no music but the
   paths of the pilloried, or shrieks of those awaiting the gallows. There
   could be no silent meeting in Cage Lane. Testimonies of the "Spirit"
   against inhumanity, delivered beside instruments of legal torture, bred
   pity in the child, who had a poetic temperament. The earliest glimpses we
   have of his childhood are in lines written on a fly caught in a spider's
   web, and an epitaph for a crow which he buried in the garden: 

   "Here lies the body of John Crow, 
    Who once was high, but now is low; 
    Ye brother Crows take warning all, 
    For as you rise, so must you fall."
   This was when he was eight years of age. It seems doubtful whether the
   child was weeping or smiling, but the humor, if it be such, is grim, and
   did not last long. He had even then already, as we shall see, gained in
   the Quaker meeting a feeling that "God was too good " to redeem man by his
   son's death, as his Aunt Cocke instructed him, and a heart so precocious
   was a sad birthright in the Thetford of that day. We look in vain for
   anything that can be described as true boyhood in Paine. Oldys was
   informed, no doubt rightly, that "he was deemed a sharp boy, of unsettled
   application; but he left no performances which denote juvenile vigour or
   uncommon attainments." There are, indeed, various indications that, in one
   way and another, Thetford and Quakerism together managed to make the early
   years of their famous son miserable. Had there been no Quakerism there had
   been no Thomas Paine; his consciousness of this finds full recognition in
   his works; yet he says: 

   "Though I reverence their philanthropy, I cannot help smiling at the
   conceit, that if the taste of a Quaker had been consulted at the creation,
   what a silent and drab-coloured creation it would have been! Not a flower
   would have blossomed its gaieties, nor a bird been permitted to
   sing."There is a pathos under his smile at this conceit. Paine wrote it in
   later life, amid the flowers and birds of his garden, which he loved, but
   whose gaieties he could never imitate. He with difficulty freed himself
   from his early addiction to an unfashionable garb; he rarely entered a
   theatre, and could never enjoy cards.

   By the light of the foregoing facts we may appreciate the few casual
   reminiscences of his school-days found in Paine's writings: 

   "My parents were not able to give me a shilling, beyond what they gave me
   in education; and to do this they distressed themselves.

   "My father being of the Quaker profession, it was my good fortune to have
   an exceeding good moral education, and a tolerable stock of useful
   learning. Though I went to the grammar school (the same school, Thetford
   in Norfolk, that the present counsellor Mingay went to, and under the same
   master), I did not learn Latin, not only because I had no inclination to
   learn languages, but because of the objection the Quakers have against the
   books in which the language is taught. But this did not prevent me from
   being acquainted with the subjects of all the Latin books used in the
   school. The natural bent of my mind was to science. I had some turn, and I
   believe some talent, for poetry; but this I rather repressed than
   encouraged, as leading too much into the field of imagination.

   "I happened, when a schoolboy, to pick up a pleasing natural history of
   Virginia, and my inclination from that day of seeing the western side of
   the Atlantic never left me."
   Paine does not mention his proficiency in mathematics; for which he was
   always distinguished. To my own mind his "turn" for poetry possesses much
   significance in the light of his career. In excluding poets from his
   "Republic" Plato may have had more reasons than he has assigned. The
   poetic temperament and power, repressed in the purely literary direction,
   are apt to break out in glowing visions of ideal society and fiery
   denunciations of the unlovely world.

   Paine was not under the master of Thetford School (Colman), who taught
   Latin, but under the usher, Mr. William Knowler, who admitted the Quaker
   lad to some intimacy, and related to him his adventures while serving on a
   man-of-war. Paine's father had a small farm, but he also carried on a
   stay-making business in Thetford, and his son was removed from school, at
   the age of thirteen, to be taught the art and mystery of making stays. To
   that he stuck for nearly five years. But his father became poorer, his
   mother probably more discontented, and the boy began to dream over the
   adventures of Master Knowler on a man-of-war.

                                  CHAPTER  II

                                EARLY STRUGGLES 
                                  [1756-1774]

   IN the middle of the eighteenth century England and France were contending
   for empire in India and in America. For some service the ship Terrible,
   Captain Death, was fitted out, and Thomas Paine made an effort to sail on
   her. It seems, however, that he was overtaken by his father on board, and
   carried home again. "From this adventure I was happily prevented by the
   affectionate and moral remonstrances of a good father, who from the habits
   of his life, being of the Quaker profession, looked on me as lost." This
   privateer lost in an engagement one hundred and seventy-five of its two
   hundred men. Thomas was then in his seventeenth year. The effect of the
   paternal remonstrances, unsupported by any congenial outlook at Thetford,
   soon wore off, and, on the formal declaration of war against France
   (1756), he was again seized with the longing for heroic adventure, and
   went to sea on the King of Prussia, privateer, Captain Mendez. Of that he
   soon got enough, but he did not return home.

   Of Paine's adventures with the privateer there is no record. Of yet more
   momentous events of his life for some years there is known nothing beyond
   the barest outline. In his twentieth year he found work in London (with
   Mr. Morris, stay-maker, Hanover Street, Longacre), and there remained near
   two years. These were fruitful years. "As soon as I was able I purchased a
   pair of globes, and attended the philosophical lectures of Martin and
   Ferguson, and became afterwards acquainted with Dr. Bevis, of the society
   called the Royal Society, then living in the Temple, and an excellent
   astronomer."

   In 1758 Paine found employment at Dover with a stay-maker named Grace. In
   April, 1759, he repaired to Sandwich, Kent, where he established himself
   as a master stay-maker. There is a tradition at Sandwich that he collected
   a congregation in his room in the market-place, and preached to them "as
   an independent, or a Methodist." Here, at twenty-two, he married Mary
   Lambert. She was an orphan and a waiting-woman to Mrs. Richard Solly, wife
   of a woollen-draper in Sandwich. The Rev. Horace Gilder, Rector of St.
   Peter's, Sandwich, has kindly referred to the register, and finds the
   entry: 

   "Thomas Pain, of the parish of St. Peters, in the town of Sandwich, in
   Kent, bachelor, and Mary Lambert, of the same parish, spinster, were
   married in this church, by licence, this 27th day of Sept., 1759, by me
   William Bunce, Rector." Signed "Thomas Pain, Mary Lambert. In the presence
   of Thomas Taylor, Maria Solly, John Joslin."
   The young couple began housekeeping on Dolphin Key, but Paine's business
   did not thrive, and he went to Margate. There, in 1760, his wife died.
   Paine then concluded to abandon the stay-making business. His wife's
   father had once been an exciseman. Paine resolved to prepare himself for
   that office, and corresponded with his father on the subject. The project
   found favor, and Paine, after passing some months of study in London,
   returned to Thetford in July, 1761. Here, while acting as a, supernumerary
   officer of excise, he continued his studies, and enjoyed the friendship of
   Mr. Cocksedge, the Recorder of Thetford. On 1 December, 1762, he was
   appointed to guage brewers' casks at Gantham. On 8 August, 1764, he was
   set to watch smugglers at Alford.

   Thus Thomas Paine, in his twenty-fifth year, was engaged in executing
   Excise Acts, whose application to America prepared the way for
   independence. Under pressure of two great hungers -- for bread, for
   science -- the young exciseman took little interest in politics. "I had no
   disposition for what is called politics. It presented to my mind no other
   idea than is contained in the word jockeyship." The excise, though a Whig
   measure, was odious to the people, and smuggling was regarded as not only
   venial but clever. Within two years after an excise of -L-1 per gallon was
   laid on spirits (1746), twelve thousand persons were convicted for
   offences against the Act, which then became a dead letter. Paine's post at
   Alford was a dangerous one. The exciseman who pounced on a party of
   smugglers got a special reward, but he risked his life. The salary was
   only fifty pounds, the promotions few, and the excise service had fallen
   into usages of negligence and corruption to which Paine was the first to
   call public attention. "After tax, charity, and fitting expenses are
   deducted, there remains very little more than forty-six pounds; and the
   expenses of housekeeping in many places cannot be brought under fourteen
   pounds a year, besides the purchase at first, and the hazard of life,
   which reduces it to thirty-two pounds per annum, or one shilling and
   nine-pence farthing per day."

   It is hardly wonderful that Paine with his globes and scientific books
   should on one occasion have fallen in with the common practice of
   excisemen called "stamping," -- that is, setting down surveys of work on
   his books, at home, without always actually travelling to the traders'
   premises and examining specimens. These detective rounds were generally
   offensive to the warehouse people so visited, and the scrutiny had become
   somewhat formal. For this case of "stamping," frankly confessed, Paine was
   discharged from office, 27 August, 17652.

   After Paine's dismission he supported himself as a journeyman with Mr.
   Gudgeon, a stay-maker of Diss, Norfolk, where he is said to have
   frequently quarrelled with his fellow-workmen. To be cast back on the
   odious work, to be discharged and penniless at twenty-eight, could hardly
   soothe the poor man's temper, and I suppose he did not remain long at
   Diss. He is traceable in 1766 in Lincolnshire, by his casual mention of
   the date in connection with an incident related in his fragment on
   "Forgetfulness." He was on a visit at the house of a widow lady in a
   village of the Lincolnshire fens, and as they were walking in the garden,
   in the summer evening, they beheld at some distance a white figure moving.
   He quitted Mrs. E. and pursued the figure, and when he at length reached
   out his hand, "the idea struck me," he says, "will my hand pass through
   the air, or shall feel anything?" It proved to be a love-distracted maiden
   who, on hearing of the marriage of one she supposed her lover, meant to
   drown herself in a neighboring pond.

   That Thomas Paine should sue for an office worth, beyond its expenses,
   thirty-two pounds, argues not merely penury, but an amazing
   unconsciousness, in his twenty-ninth year, of his powers. In London, for
   some months there stood between him and starvation only a salary of
   twenty-five pounds, given him by a Mr. Noble for teaching English in his
   academy in Goodman's Fields. This was the year 1766, for though Paine was
   restored to the excise on July 11th of this year no place was found for
   him. In January, 1767, he was employed by Mr. Gardiner in his school at
   Kensington. Rickman and others have assigned to this time Paine's
   attendance of lectures at the Royal Society, which I have however
   connected with his twentieth year. He certainly could not have afforded
   globes during this pauperized year 1766. In reply to Rickman's allusion to
   the lowly situations he had been in at this time, Paine remarked: "Here I
   derived considerable information; indeed I have seldom passed five minutes
   of my life, however circumstanced, in which I did not acquire some
   knowledge."

   According to Oldys he remained in the school at Kensington but three
   months. "His desire of preaching now returned on him," says the same
   author, "but applying to his old master for a certificate of his
   qualifications, to the bishop of London, Mr. Noble told his former usher,
   that since he was only an English scholar he could not recommend him as a
   proper candidate for ordination in the church." It would thus appear that
   Paine had not parted from his employer in Goodman's Fields in any
   unpleasant way. Of his relation with his pupils only one trace remains --
   a letter in which he introduces one of them to General Knox, September 17,
   1783:   "Old friend, I just take the opportunity of sending my respects to
   you by Mr. Darby, a gentleman who was formerly a pupil of mine in
   England."

   Oldys says that Paine, "without regular orders," preached in Moorfields
   and elsewhere in England, "as he was urged by his necessities or directed
   by his spirit." Although Paine's friendly biographers have omitted this
   preaching episode, it is too creditable to Paine's standing with the
   teacher with whom he had served a year for Oldys to have invented it. It
   is droll to think that the Church of England should ever have had an offer
   of Thomas Paine's services. The Quakerism in which he had been nurtured
   had never been formally adopted by him, and it offered no opportunities
   for the impulse to preach which seems to mark a phase in the life of every
   active English brain.

   On May 15, 1767, Paine was appointed excise officer at Grampound,
   Cornwall, but "prayed leave to wait another vacancy." On February 19,
   1768, he was appointed officer at Lewes, Sussex, whither, after a brief
   visit to Thetford, he repaired.

   Not very unlike the old Norfolk borough in which Paine was born was Lewes,
   and with even literally an Ouse flowing through it. Here also marched the
   "Heathen Men," who have left only the legend of a wounded son of Harold
   nursed into health by a Christian maiden. The ruined castle commands a
   grander landscape than the height of Thetford, and much the same historic
   views. Seven centuries before Paine opened his office in Lewes came
   Harold's son, possibly to take charge of the excise as established by
   Edward the Confessor, just deceased.

   "Paine" was an historic name in Lewes also. In 1688 two French refugees,
   William and Aaron Paine, came to the ancient town, and found there as much
   religious persecution as in France. It was directed chiefly against the
   Quakers. But when Thomas Paine went to dwell there the Quakers and the
   "powers that be" had reached a modus vivendi, and the new exciseman fixed
   his abode with a venerable Friend, Samuel Ollive, a tobacconist. The house
   then adjoined a Quaker meetinghouse, now a Unitarian chapel. It is a
   quaint house, always known and described as "the house with the monkey on
   it." The projecting roof is supported by a female nondescript rather more
   human than anthropoid. I was politely shown through the house by its
   occupant, Mr. Champion, and observed in the cellar traces of Samuel
   Ollive's -- afterward Paine's -- tobacco mill. The best room upstairs long
   bore on its wall "Tom Paine's study." The plaster has now flaked off, but
   the proprietor, Mr. Alfred Hammond, told me that he remembers it there in
   1840. Not far from the house is the old mansion of the Shelleys, -- still
   called "The Shelleys," -- ancestors of a poet born with the "Rights of
   Man," and a child of Paine's revolution. And -- such are the moral zones
   and poles in every English town -- here in the graveyard of Jireh Chapel
   -- is the tomb of William Huntington S. S. [Sinner Saved] bearing this
   epitaph: 

   "Here lies the Coalheaver, beloved of God, but abhorred of men: the
   omniscient judge, at the grand assize, shall ratify and confirm that to
   the confusion of many thousands; for England and its metropolis shall know
   that there hath been a prophet among them. W. H : S. S."
   While Paine was at Lewes this Hunt alias Huntington was a pious tramp in
   that part of England, well known to the police. Yet in his rubbish there
   is one realistic story of tramp-life which incidentally portrays an
   exciseman of the time. Huntington (born 1744), one of the eleven children
   of a day-laborer earning from seven to nine shillings a week in Kent, was
   sent by some friends to an infant school.

   "And here I remember to have heard my mistress reprove me for something
   wrong, telling me that God Almighty took notice of children's sins. It
   stuck to my conscience a great while; and who this God Almighty could be I
   could not conjecture; and how he could know my sins without asking my
   mother I could not conceive. At that time there was a person named
   Godfrey, an exciseman in the town, a man of a stern and hard-favoured
   countenance, whom I took notice of for having a stick covered with
   figures, and an ink-bottle hanging at the button-hole of his coat. I
   imagined that man to be employed by God Almighty to take notice, and keep
   an account of children's sins; and once I got into the market-house, and
   watched him very narrowly, and found that he was always in a hurry by his
   walking so fast; and I thought he had need to hurry, as he must have a
   deal to do to find out all the sins of children. I watched him out of one
   shop into another, all about the town, and from that time eyed him as a
   most formidable being, and the greatest enemy I had in all the world."

   To the shopkeepers this exciseman was really an adversary and an accuser,
   and one can well believe that his very physiognomy would be affected by
   such work, and the chronic consciousness of being unwelcome. We may
   picture Paine among the producers of Lewes -- with but four or five
   thousand people, then a notorious seat of smugglers -- with his stick and
   ink-bottle; his face prematurely aged, and gathering the lines and the
   keen look which mask for casual eyes the fundamental candor and kindliness
   of his face.

   Paine's surveys extended to Brighton; the brilliant city of our time being
   then a small fishingtown known as Brighthelmston. It was scarce ten miles
   distant, and had no magistrates, offenders being taken to Lewes. There was
   a good deal of religious excitement in the neighborhood about the time
   Paine went there to reside, owing to the preaching of Rev. George
   Whitefield, chaplain of Lady Huntingdon, at a chapel built by her ladyship
   at Brighthelmston. Lady Huntingdon already had a quasi-miraculous fame
   which in Catholic times would have caused her to be honored as St. Selina.
   In those days a pious countess was more miraculous than the dream that
   foretold about Lady Huntingdon's coming. Surrounded by crowds, she had to
   send for her chaplain, Whitefield, who preached in a field till a chapel
   was built. At the time when Lady Huntingdon was exhorting the poor
   villagers of Brighton, two relatives of hers, Governor Shirley of
   Massachusetts and his aide-de-camp Colonel George Washington, were
   preparing the way for the great events in which Paine was to bear a part.

   When Paine went on his survey he might have observed the Washington motto,
   possibly a trace of the pious countess, which long remained on a house in
   Brighton: Exitus acta probat. There was an ancient Washington who fought
   at the battle of Lewes; but probably if our exciseman ever thought of any
   Washington at all it was of the anomalous Colonel in Virginia founding a
   colonial association to disuse excisable articles imported from England.
   But if such transatlantic phenomena, or the preaching of Whitefield in the
   neighborhood, concerned Paine at all, no trace of their impression is now
   discoverable. And if there were any protest in him at that time, when the
   English government had reached its nadir of corruption, it cannot be
   heard. He appears to have been conventionally patriotic, and was regarded
   as the Lewes laureate. He wrote an election song for the Whig candidate at
   New Shoreham, for which the said candidate, (Rumbold by name) paid him
   three guineas; and he wrote a song on the death of General Wolfe, which,
   when published some years later, was set to music, and enjoyed popularity
   in the Anacreontic and other societies. While Britannia mourns for her
   Wolfe, the sire of the gods sends his messengers to console "the
   disconsolate dame," assuring her that her hero is not dead but summoned to
   lead "the armies above" against the proud giants marching against Heaven.

   The ballad recalls Paine the paien, but the Thetford Quaker is not
   apparent. And, indeed, there are various indications about this time that
   some reaction had set in after the preaching phase.

   "Such was his enterprise on the water," says Oldys, "and his intrepidity
   on the ice that he became known by the appellation of Commodore." William
   Carver (MS.) says he was at this time "tall and slim, about five feet
   eight inches."

   At Lewes, where the traditions concerning Paine are strong, I met Miss
   Rickman, a descendant of Thomas "Clio" Rickman -- the name Clio, under
   which his musical contributions to the Revolution were published, having
   become part of his name. Rickman was a youth in the Lewes of Paine's time,
   and afterwards his devoted friend. His enthusiasm was represented in
   children successively named Paine, Washington, Franklin, Rousseau,
   Petrarch, Volney. Rickman gives an account of Paine at Lewes: 
   "In this place he lived several years in habits of intimacy with a very
   respectable, sensible, and convivial set of acquaintance, who were
   entertained with his witty sallies and informed by his more serious
   conversations. In politics he was at this time a Whig, and notorious for
   that quality which has been defined perseverance in a good cause and
   obstinacy in a bad one. He was tenacious of his opinions, which were bold,
   acute, and independent, and which he maintained with ardour, elegance, and
   argument. At this period, at Lewes, the White Hart evening club was the
   resort of a social and intelligent circle who, out of fun, seeing that
   disputes often ran very warm and high, frequently had what they called the
   `Headstrong Book.'   This was no other than an old Greek Homer which was
   sent the morning after a debate vehemently maintained, to the most
   obstinate haranguer in the Club this book had the following title, as
   implying that Mr. Paine the best deserved and the most frequently obtained
   it:

   `The Headstrong Book, or Original Book of Obstinacy.'   Written by ****
   ****, of Lewes, in Sussex, and Revised and Corrected by THOMAS PAINE.

   "`Immortal PAINE, while mighty reasoners jar, 
     We cown thee General of the Headstrong War; 
     Thy logic vanquish'd error, and thy mind 
     No bounds but those of right and truth confined. 
     Thy soul of fire must sure ascend the sky, 
     Immortal PAINE, thy fame can never die; 
     For men like thee their names must ever save 
     From the black edicts of the tyrant grave.'

   "My friend Mr. Lee, of Lewes, in communicating this to me in September,
   1810, said: `This was manufactured nearly forty years ago, as applicable
   to Mr. Paine, and I believe you will allow, however indifferent the
   manner, that I did not very erroneously anticipate his future celebrity.'
   "
   It was probably to amuse the club at the White Hart, an ancient tavern,
   that Paine wrote his humorous poems.

   On the 26 March, 1771, Paine married Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Ollive,
   with whom he had lodged. This respected citizen had died in July, 1769,
   leaving in Lewes a widow and one daughter in poor circumstances. Paine
   then took up his abode elsewhere, but in the following year he joined the
   Ollives in opening a shop, and the tobacco-mill went on as before. His
   motive was probably compassion, but it brought him into nearer
   acquaintance with the widow and her daughter. Elizabeth is said to have
   been pretty, and, being of Quaker parentage, she was no doubt fairly
   educated. She was ten years younger than Paine, and he was her hero. They
   were married in St. Michael's Church, Lewes, on the 26th of March, 1771,
   by Robert Austen, curate, the witnesses being Henry Verrall and Thomas
   Ollive, the lady's brother.

   Oldys is constrained to give Paine's ability recognition. "He had risen by
   superior energy, more than by greater honesty, to be a chief among the
   excisemen." They needed a spokesman at that time, being united in an
   appeal to Parliament to raise their salaries, and a sum of money, raised
   to prosecute the matter, was confided to Paine. In 1772 he prepared the
   document, which was printed, but not published until 17933. Concerning the
   plea for the excisemen it need only be said that it is as clear and
   complete as any lawyer could make it. There was, of course, no room for
   originality in the simple task of showing that the ill-paid service must
   be badly done, but the style is remarkable for simplicity and force.

   Paine put much time and pains into this composition, and passed the whole
   winter of 1772-3 trying to influence members of Parliament and others in
   favor of his cause. "A rebellion of the excisemen," says Oldys, "who
   seldom have the populace on their side, was not much feared by their
   superiors." Paine's pamphlet and two further leaflets of his were printed.
   The best result of his pamphlet was to secure him an acquaintance with
   Oliver Goldsmith, to whom he addressed the following letter-----

   "HONORED SIR,

   "Herewith I present you with the Case of the Officers of Excise. A
   compliment of this kind from an entire stranger may appear somewhat
   singular, but the following reasons and information will, I presume,
   sufficiently apologize. I act myself in the humble station of an officer
   of excise, though somewhat differently circumstanced to what many of them
   are, and have been the principal promoter of a plan for applying to
   Parliament this session for an increase of salary. A petition for this
   purpose has been circulated through every part of the kingdom, and signed
   by all the officers therein. A subscription of three shillings per officer
   is raised, amounting to upwards of -L-500, for supporting the expenses.
   The excise officers, in all cities and corporate towns, have obtained
   letters of recommendation from the electors to the members in their
   behalf, many or most of whom have promised their support. The enclosed
   case we have presented to most of the members, and shall to all, before
   the petition appear in the House. The memorial before you met with so much
   approbation while in manuscript, that I was advised to print 4000 copies;
   3000 of which were subscribed for the officers in general, and the
   remaining 1000 reserved for presents. Since the delivering them I have
   received so many letters of thanks and approbation for the performance,
   that were I not rather singularly modest, I should insensibly become a
   little vain. The literary fame of Dr. Goldsmith4 has induced me to present
   one to him, such as it is. It is my first and only attempt, and even now I
   should not have undertaken it, had I not been particularly applied to by
   some of my superiors in office. I have some few questions to trouble Dr.
   Goldsmith with, and should esteem his company for an hour or two, to
   partake of a bottle of wine, or any thing else, and apologize for this
   trouble, as a singular favour conferred on

   "His unknown Humble servant and admirer,  

   "THOMAS PAINE.

   "Excise Coffee House, 
   "Broad Street, Dec. 21, 1772.

   "P. S. Shall take the liberty of waiting on you in a day or two."

   To one who reads Paine's argument, it appears wonderful that a man of such
   ability should, at the age of thirty-five, have had his horizon filled
   with such a cause as that of the underpaid excisemen. Unable to get the
   matter before Parliament, he went back to his tobacco-mill in Lewes, and
   it seemed to him like the crack of doom when, 8 April, 1774, he was
   dismissed from the excise. The cause of Paine's second dismission from the
   excise being ascribed by his first biographer (Oldys) to his dealing in
   smuggled tobacco, without contradiction by Paine, his admirers have been
   misled into a kind of apology for him on account of the prevalence of the
   custom. But I have before me the minutes of the Board concerning Paine,
   and there is no hint whatever of any such accusation5. The order of
   discharge from Lewes is as follows:
   "Friday 8th April 1774. Thomas Pain, Officer of Lewes 4th O. Ride Sussex
   Collection having quitted his Business, without obtaining the Board's
   Leave for so doing, and being gone off on Account of the Debts which he
   hath contracted, as by Letter of the 6th instant from Edward Clifford,
   Supervisor, and the said Pain having been once before Discharged, Ordered
   that he be again discharged."
   In Paine's absence in London, writing his pleas for the excisemen,
   laboring with members of Parliament, his tobacco-mill had been still, his
   groceries unsold, and his wife and her mother had been supported from the
   bank of flattering hope. No sooner was it known that the hope of an
   increased salary for the excisemen had failed than he found himself in
   danger of arrest for debt. It was on this account that he left Lewes for a
   time, but it was only that he might take steps to make over all of his
   possessions to his creditors. This was done. The following placard
   appeared:
   "To be sold by auction, on Thursday the 14th of April, and following day,
   all the household furniture, stock in trade and other effects of Thomas
   Pain, grocer and tobacconist, near the West Gate, in Lewes: Also a horse
   tobacco and snuff mill, with all the utensils for cutting tobacco and
   grinding off snuff; and two unopened crates of cream-coloured stone ware."
   This sale was announced by one Whitfield, grocer, and if there were other
   creditors they were no doubt paid by the results, for Paine had no
   difficulty in returning to Lewes. He once more had to petition the Board,
   which shortly before had commended his assiduity. Its commissioner, George
   Lewes Scott, labored in his behalf. In vain. Whether it was because it was
   a rule that a second discharge should be final, or that his failure to
   move Parliament had made him a scapegoat for the disappointed excisemen,
   his petition was rejected. At thirty-seven Paine found himself penniless. 

                                  CHAPTER  III

                               DOMESTIC TROUBLE 
                                     [1774]

   THE break-up of Paine's business at Lewes brought to a head a more serious
   trouble. On June 4th of the same miserable year, 1774, Paine and his wife
   formally separated.

   The causes of their trouble are enveloped in mystery. It has been stated
   by both friendly and hostile biographers that there was from the first no
   cohabitation, and that concerning the responsibility for this neither of
   them was ever induced to utter a word. Even his friend Rickman was warned
   off the subject by Paine, who, in reply to a question as to the reason of
   the separation, said: "It is nobody's business but my own; I had cause for
   it, but I will name it to no one."

   William Huntington, in his "Kingdom of Heaven," mentions a usage of some
   Quakers in his time, "that when a young couple are espoused, they are to
   be kept apart for a season to mourn"; this being their interpretation of
   Zech. xii., 12-14. As Huntington was mainly acquainted with this Sussex
   region, it is not inconceivable that Elizabeth Ollive held some such
   notion, and that this led to dissension ending in separation. Nor is it
   inconceivable that Paine himself, finding his excise office no support,
   and his shop a failure, resolved that no offspring should suffer his
   penury or increase it. It is all mere uesswork. Mr. Alfred Hammond, of
   Lewes, who owns the property, showed me the documents connected with it.
   After the death of Samuel Ollive in 1769, Esther, his widow, enjoyed the
   messuage until her own death, in 1800, when a division among the heirs
   became necessary. Among the documents is one which recites some
   particulars of the separation between Paine and his wife. 

   "Soon after the Testator's death, his daughter Elizabeth married Thos.
   Pain from whom she afterwards lived separate under articles dated 4th June
   1774, and made between the said Thos. Pain of the first part, the said
   Elizabeth of the 2nd part, and the Rev. James Castley, Clerk, of the 3d
   part, by which Articles, after reciting (inter alia) that Dissentions had
   arisen between the said Thos. Pain and Elizabeth his wife, and that they
   bad agreed to live separate. And also reciting the Will of the said Saml.
   Ollive and that the said Thomas Pain had agreed that the said Elizabeth
   should have and take her share of the said Monies of the said House when
   the same should become due and payable and that he would give any
   Discharge that should then be required to and for the use of the said
   Elizabeth: The said Thos. Pain did covenant to permit the said Elizabeth
   to live separate from him and to carry on such Trade and Business as she
   should think fit, notwithstanding her coverture and as if she were a Feme.
   Sole. And that he would not at any time thereafter claim or demand the
   said monies which she should be entitled to at the time of the sale of the
   said House in Lewes aforesaid, or any of the Monies Rings Plate Cloathes
   Linen Woollen Household Goods or Stock in Trade which the said Elizabeth
   should or might at any time thereafter buy or purchase or which should be
   devised or given to her or she should otherwise acquire and that she
   should and might enjoy and absolutely dispose of the same as if she were a
   Feme. Sole and unmarried. And also that it should and might be lawful for
   the said Elizabeth to have receive and take to her own separate use and
   benefit her said share of the Monies for which the said Messuage or
   Tenement in Lewes should be sold when the same should become due and
   payable.
   Another paper is a Release to Francis Mitchener, October 14, 1800, in
   which it is recited: 

   "That the said Elizabeth Pain had ever since lived separate from him the
   said Thos. Pain, and never had any issue, and the said Thomas Pain had
   many years quitted this kingdom and resided (if living) in parts beyond
   the seas, but had not since been heard of by the said Elizabeth Pain, nor
   was it known for certain whether he was living or dead."
   This release is signed by Robert Blackman and wife, and eight others,
   among these being the three children of Samuel Ollive, who under his will
   were to "share alike" -- Samuel, Thomas, and Elizabeth (Mrs. Paine). The
   large seals attached to the signatures were fortunately well preserved,
   for each represents the head of Thomas Paine. By the assistance of Mr.
   Hammond I am able to present this little likeness of Paine that must have
   been made when he was about thirty-five, or nearly twenty years earlier
   than any other portrait of him. The reader must form his own conjecture as
   to the origin of this seal, its preservation by the wife, and use on this
   document. At this time, and probably since her separation, Elizabeth Paine
   would appear to have resided with her brother Thomas, a watchmaker in
   Cranbrook, Kent. That she and the family did not know Paine's whereabouts
   in 1800, or whether he were dead or alive, argues that they had not
   followed his career or the course of public events with much interest. One
   would be glad to believe that Elizabeth cherished kindly remembrance of
   the man who considering his forlorn condition, had certainly shown
   generosity in the justice with which he renounced all of his rights in the
   property she had brought him, and whose hand she might naturally have
   suspected behind the monies anonymously sent her. We will therefore hope
   that it was from some other member of the family that Oldys obtained, --
   unless, like his "A. M. of the University of Philadelphia," it was
   invented, the letter said to have been written by Paine's mother to his
   wife6. The letter may have been manipulated, but it is not improbable that
   rumors, "exaggerated by enmity or misstated by malice," as Oldys
   confesses, elicited some such outburst from Thetford7. The excisemen,
   angry at the failure to get their case before Parliament, and having fixed
   on Paine as their scapegoat, all other iniquities were naturally laid on
   him. Eighteen years later, when the scapegoat who had gone into the
   American wilderness returned with the renown of having helped to make it a
   nation, he addressed a letter to Lewes, which was about to hold a meeting
   to respond to a royal proclamation for suppressing seditious writings. His
   tone is not that of a man who supposed that Lewes had aught against him on
   the score of his wife. 

   "It is now upwards of eighteen years since I was a resident inhabitant of
   the town of Lewes. My situation among you as an officer of the revenue,
   for more than six years, enabled me to see into the numerous and various
   distresses which the weight of taxes even at that time of day occasioned;
   and feeling, as I then did, and as it is natural for me to do, for the
   hard condition of others, it is with pleasure I can declare, and every
   person then under my survey, and now living, can witness the exceeding
   candor, and even tenderness, with which that part of the duty that fell to
   my share was executed. The name of Thomas Paine is not to be found in the
   records of the Lewes justices, in any one act of contention with, or
   severity of any kind whatever towards, the persons whom he surveyed,
   either in the town or in the country; of this Mr. Fuller and Mr. Shelley,
   who will probably attend the meeting, can, if they please, give full
   testimony. It is, however, not in their power to contradict it. Having
   thus indulged myself in recollecting a place where I formerly had, and
   even now have, many friends, rich and poor, and most probably some
   enemies,

   I proceed to the import of my letter. Since my departure from Lewes,
   fortune or providence has thrown me into a line of action which my first
   setting out in life could not possibly have suggested to me. Many of you
   will recollect that, whilst I resided among you, there was not a man more
   firm and open in supporting the principles of liberty than myself, and I
   still pursue, and ever will, the same path."
   Finally, it should be added that Rickman, a truthful man, who admits
   Paine's faults, says "This I can assert, that Mr. Paine always spoke
   tenderly and respectfully of his wife; and sent her several times
   pecuniary aid, without her knowing even whence it came."

   While Paine was in London, trying to get before Parliament a measure for
   the relief of excisemen, he not only enjoyed the friendship of Goldsmith,
   but that of Franklin. In the Doctor's electrical experiments he took a
   deep interest; for Paine was devoted to science, and the extent of his
   studies is attested by his description of a new electrical machine and
   other scientific papers, signed "Atlanticus," in the Pennsylvania
   Magazine. The sale of his effects in Lewes paid his debts, but left him
   almost penniless. He came to London, and how he lived is unknown -- that
   is, physically, for we do find some intimation of his mental condition. In
   a letter written many years after to John King, a political renegade,
   Paine says: 

   "When I first knew you in Ailiffe-street, an obscure part of the City, a
   child, without fortune or friends, I noticed you; because I thought I saw
   in you, young as you was, a bluntness of temper, a boldness of opinion,
   and an originality of thought, that portended some future good. I was
   pleased to discuss, with you, under our friend Oliver's lime-tree, those
   political notions, which I have since given the world in my 'Rights of
   Man.' You used to complain of abuses, as well as me, and write your
   opinions on them in free terms -- What then means this sudden attachment
   to Kings?"
   This "Oliver" was probably the famous Alderman Oliver who was imprisoned
   in the Tower during the great struggle of the City with the Government, on
   account of Wilkes. Paine tells us that in early life he cared little for
   politics, which seemed to him a species of "jockeyship"; and how apt the
   term is shown by the betting-book kept at Brooks' Club, in which are
   recorded the bets of the noblemen and politicians of the time on the
   outcome of every motion and course of every public man or minister. But
   the contemptuous word proves that Paine was deeply interested in the
   issues which the people had joined with the king and his servile
   ministers. He could never have failed to read with excitement the letters
   of Junius, whose "brilliant pen," he afterwards wrote, "enraptured without
   convincing; and though in the plenitude of its rage it might be said to
   give elegance to bitterness, yet the policy survived the blast." We may
   feel sure that he had heard with joy that adroit verdict of the jury at
   the King's Bench on Woodfall, Junius' printer, which secured liberty of
   the press until, twenty-two years later, it was reversed by revolutionary
   panic, in the same court, for Paine himself. Notwithstanding the private
   immorality of Wilkes, in which his associates were aristocratic, the most
   honorable political elements in England, and the Independents and
   Presbyterians, were resolute in defending the rights of his constituents
   against the authority arrogated by the Commons to exclude him. Burke then
   stood by Wilkes, as John Bright stood by Bradlaugh at a later day. And
   while Paine was laboring to carry his excise bill through Parliament he
   had good opportunity to discover how completely that body's real opinions
   were overruled by royal dictation. It was at that time that George III.,
   indifferent to his brother's profligacies, would not forgive his marriage
   with a commoner's sister, and forced on Parliament a Marriage Act which
   made all marriages in the royal family illegitimate without his consent.
   The indignant resignation of Fox modified the measure slightly, limiting
   the King's interference at the twenty-sixth year of the marrying parties,
   and then giving the veto to Parliament. For this the King turned his wrath
   on Fox. This was but one of the many instances of those years -- all told
   in Trevelyan's admirable work8 -- which added to Paine's studies of the
   Wilkes conflicts a lasting lesson in the conservation of despotic forces.
   The barbaric eras of prerogative had returned under the forms of
   ministerial government. The Ministry, controlled by the Court, ruled by
   corruption of commoners.

   It was a regime almost incredible to us now, when England is of all
   nations most free from corruption and court influence in politics; and it
   was little realized in English colonies before the Revolution. But
   Franklin was in London to witness it, and Paine was there to grow familiar
   with the facts. To both of them the systematic inhumanity and injustice
   were brought home personally. The discharged and insulted postmaster could
   sympathize with the dismissed and starving exciseman. Franklin recognized
   Paine's ability, and believed he would be useful and successful in
   America. So on this migration Paine decided, and possibly the
   determination brought his domestic discords to a crisis.

                                  CHAPTER  IV

                                 THE NEW WORLD 
                                     [1775]

   PAINE left England in October and arrived in America November 30, 1774. He
   bore a letter of introduction from Dr. Franklin to Richard Bache, his
   son-in-law, dated September 30, 1774: 

   "The bearer Mr. Thomas Paine is very well recommended to me as an
   ingenious worthy young man. He goes to Pennsylvania with a view of
   settling there. I request you to give him your best advice and
   countenance, as he is quite a stranger there. If you can put him in a way
   of obtaining employment as a clerk, or assistant tutor in a school, or
   assistant surveyor, of all of which I think him very capable, so that he
   may procure a subsistence at least, till he can make acquaintance and
   obtain a knowledge of the country, you will do well, and much oblige your
   affectionate father."
   On March 4, 1775, Paine writes Franklin from Philadelphia: 

   "Your countenancing me has obtained for me many friends and much
   reputation, for which please accept my sincere thanks. I have been applied
   to by several gentlemen to instruct their sons on very advantageous terms
   to myself, and a printer and bookseller here, a man of reputation and
   property, Robert Aitkin, has lately attempted a magazine, but having
   little or no turn that way himself, he has applied to me for assistance.
   He had not above six hundred subscribers when I first assisted him. We
   have now upwards of fifteen hundred, and daily increasing. I have not
   entered into terms with him. This is only the second number. The first I
   was not concerned in."
   It has been often stated that Paine was befriended by Dr. Rush, but there
   is no indication of this. Their acquaintance was casual. 

   "About the year 1773 [says Dr. Rush -- the date is an error for 1774] I
   met him accidentally in Mr. Aitkin's bookstore, and was introduced to him
   by Mr. Aitkin. We conversed a few minutes, and I left him. Soon afterwards
   I read a short essay with which I was much pleased, in one of Bradford's
   papers, against the slavery of the Africans in our country, and which I
   was informed was written by Mr. Paine. This excited my desire to be better
   acquainted with him. We met soon afterwards in Mr. Aitkin's bookstore,
   where I did homage to his principles and pen upon the subject of the
   enslaved Africans. He told me the essay to which I alluded was the first
   thing he had ever published in his life. After this Mr. Aitkin employed
   him as the editor of his Magazine, with a salary of fifty pounds currency
   a year. This work was well supported by him. His song upon the death of
   Gen. Wolfe, and his reflections upon the death of Lord Clive, gave it a
   sudden currency which few works of the kind have since had in our
   country."
   As the anti-slavery essay was printed March 8, 1775, it appears that Paine
   had been in America more than three months before Rush noticed him.

   The first number of the Pennsylvania Magazine, or American Museum,
   appeared at the end of January, 1775. Though not concerned" in it
   pecuniarily, not yet being editor, his contributions increased the
   subscription list, and he was at once engaged. For eighteen months Paine
   edited this magazine, and probably there never was an equal amount of good
   literary work done on a salary of fifty pounds a year. It was a handsome
   magazine, with neat vignette-book, plough, anchor, and olive-twined
   shield, -- the motto, Fuval in sylvis habilare. The future author of
   the "Rights of Man" and "Age of Reason" admonishes correspondents that
   religion and politics are forbidden topics! The first number contains a
   portrait of Goldsmith and the picture of a new electrical machine. A
   prefatory note remarks that "the present perplexities of affairs" have
   "encompassed with difficulties the first number of the magazine, which,
   like the early snowdrop, comes forth in a barren season, and contents
   itself with modestly foretelling that choicer flowers are preparing to
   appear." The opening essay shows a fine literary touch, and occasionally a
   strangely modern vein of thought. "Our fancies would be highly diverted
   could we look back and behold a circle of original Indians haranguing on
   the sublime perfections of the age; yet 't is not impossible but future
   times may exceed us as much as we have exceeded them."

   Here is a forerunner of Macaulay's New Zealander sketching the ruins of
   St. Paul's. It is followed by a prediction that the coming American
   magazine will surpass the English, "because we are not exceeded in
   abilities, have a more extended field for inquiry, and whatever may be our
   political state, our happiness will always depend upon ourselves." A
   feature of the magazine was the description, with plates, of recent
   English inventions not known in the new world -- threshing-machine,
   spinning-machine, etc., -- such papers being by Paine. These attracted the
   members of the Philosophical Society, founded by Franklin, and Paine was
   welcomed into their circle by Rittenhouse, Clymer, Rush, Muhlenberg, and
   other representatives of the scientific and literary metropolis. Many a
   piece composed for the Headstrong Club at Lewes first saw the light in
   this magazine, -- such as the humorous poems, "The Monk and the Jew," "The
   Farmer and Short's Dog, Porter"; also the famous ballad "On the Death of
   General Wolfe," printed March, 1775, with music Lewes had not, indeed,
   lost sight of him, as is shown by a communication in April from Dr.
   Matthew Wilson, dated from that town, relating to a new kind of fever
   raging in England.

   The reader who has studied Paine's avowed and well-known works finds no
   difficulty in tracking him beneath the various signatures by which he
   avoided an appearance of writing most of the articles in the Pennsylvania
   Magazine, though he really did. He is now "Atlanticus," now "Vox Populi,"
   or "AEsop," and oftener affixes no signature. The Thetford Quaker is still
   here in "Reflections on the Death of Lord Clive" (reprinted as a pamphlet
   in England), "A New Anecdote of Alexander the Great," and"Cursory
   Reflections on the Single Combat or Modern Duel." The duel was hardly yet
   challenged in America when Paine wrote (May, 1775): 
    

   "From the peculiar prevalence of this custom in countries where the
   religious system is established which, of all others, most expressly
   prohibits the gratification of revenge, with every species of outrage and
   violence, we too plainly see how little mankind are in reality influenced
   by the precepts of the religion by which they profess to be guided, and in
   defence of which they will occasionally risk even their lives."
   But with this voice from Thetford meeting-house mingles the testimony of
   "common sense." In July, 1775, he writes: 

   "I am thus far a Quaker, that I would gladly agree with all the world to
   lay aside the use of arms, and settle matters by negotiations; but, unless
   the whole world wills, the matter ends, and I take up my musket, and thank
   heaven he has put it in my power. . . . We live not in a world of angels.
   The reign of Satan is not ended, neither can we expect to be defended by
   miracles."
   Titles he sees through (May, 1775): 

   "The Honourable plunderer of his country, or the Right Honourable murderer
   of mankind, create such a contrast of ideas as exhibit a monster rather
   than a man. The lustre of the Star, and the title of My Lord, overawe the
   superstitious vulgar, and forbid them to enquire into the character of the
   possessor: Nay more, they are, as it were, bewitched to admire in the
   great the vices they would honestly condemn in themselves. . . . The
   reasonable freeman sees through the magic of a title, and examines the man
   before he approves him. To him the honours of the worthless seem to write
   their masters' vices in capitals, and their Stars shine to no other end
   than to read them by. Modesty forbids men separately, or collectively, to
   assume titles. But as all honours, even that of kings, originated from the
   public, the public may justly be called the true fountain of honour. And
   it is with much pleasure I have heard the title `Honourable' applied to a
   body of men, who nobly disregarding private ease and interest for public
   welfare, have justly merited the address of The Honourable Continental
   Congress" whose rights Christendom was then not awakened. His pen is
   unmistakable in "Reflections on Unhappy Marriages" (June, 1775): "As
   extasy abates coolness succeeds, which often makes way for indifference,
   and that for neglect. Sure of each other by the nuptial bond, they no
   longer take any pains to be mutually agreeable. Careless if they
   displease, and yet angry if reproached; with so little relish for each
   other's company that anybody else's is more welcome, and more
   entertaining." It is a more pointed statement of the problem already
   suggested, in the April magazine, by his well-known fable "Cupid and
   Hymen," whose controversies are now settled in the Divorce Court.

   In his August (1775) number is found the earliest American plea for woman.
   It is entitled "An Occasional Letter on the Female Sex," and unsigned, but
   certainly by Paine. His trick of introducing a supposititious address from
   another person, as in the following extract, appears in many examples. 

   "Affronted in one country by polygamy, which gives them their rivals for
   inseparable companions; inslaved in another by indissoluble ties, which
   often join the gentle to the rude, and sensibility to brutality: Even in
   countries where they may be esteemed most happy, constrained in their
   desires in the disposal of their goods, robbed of freedom of will by the
   laws, the slaves of opinion, which rules them with absolute sway, and
   construes the slightest appearances into guilt, surrounded on all sides by
   judges who are at once their tyrants and seducers, and who after having
   prepared their faults, punish every lapse with dishonour -- nay usurp the
   right of degrading them on suspicion! -- who does not feel for the tender
   sex? Yet such I am sorry to say is the lot of woman over the whole earth.
   Man with regard to them, in all climates and in all ages, has been either
   an insensible husband or an oppressor; but they have sometimes experienced
   the cold and deliberate oppression of pride, and sometimes the violent and
   terrible tyranny of jealousy. When they are not beloved they are nothing;
   and when they are they are tormented. They have almost equal cause to be
   afraid of indifference and love. Over three quarters of the globe Nature
   has placed them between contempt and misery."
   "Even among people where beauty receives the highest homage we find men
   who would deprive the sex of every kind of reputation. `The most virtuous
   woman,' says a celebrated Greek, `is she who is least talked of.' That
   morose man, while he imposes duties on women, would deprive them of the
   sweets of public esteem, and in exacting virtues from them would make it a
   crime to aspire to honour. If a woman were to defend the cause of her sex
   she might address him in the following manner

   "How great is your injustice! If we have an equal right with you to
   virtue, why should we not have an equal right to praise? The public esteem
   ought to wait upon merit. Our duties are different from yours, but they
   are not less difficult to fulfil, or of less consequence to society: They
   are the foundations of your felicity, and the sweetness of life. We are
   wives and mothers. 

   "'T is we who form the union and the cordiality of families; 'tis we who
   soften that savage rudeness which considers everything as due to force,
   and which would involve man with man in eternal war. We cultivate in you
   that humanity which makes you feel for the misfortunes of others, and our
   tears forewarn you of your own danger. Nay, you cannot be ignorant that we
   have need of courage not less than you: More feeble in ourselves, we have
   perhaps more trials to encounter. Nature assails us with sorrow, law and
   custom press us with constraint, and sensibility and virtue alarm us by
   their continual conflict. Sometimes also the name of citizen demands from
   us the tribute of fortitude. When you offer your blood to the state, think
   that it is ours. In giving it our sons and our husbands we give it more
   than ourselves. You can only die on the field of battle, but we have the
   misfortune to survive those whom we love the most. Alas! while your
   ambitious vanity is unceasingly laboring to cover the earth with statues,
   with monuments, and with inscriptions to eternize, if possible, your
   names, and give yourselves an existence when this body is no more, why
   must we be condemned to live and to die unknown? Would that the grave and
   eternal forgetfulness should be our lot. Be not our tyrants in all: Permit
   our names to be sometime pronounced beyond the narrow circle in which we
   live: Permit friendship, or at least love, to inscribe its emblems on the
   tomb where our ashes repose; and deny us not the public esteem which,
   after the esteem of one's self, is the sweetest reward of welldoing."
   Thus the Pennsylvania Magazine, in the time that Paine edited it, was a
   seed-bag from which) this sower scattered the seeds of great reforms
   ripening with the progress of civilization. Through the more popular press
   he sowed also. Events selected his seeds of American independence, of
   republican equality, freedom from royal, ecclesiastical, and hereditary
   privilege, for a swifter and more imposing harvest; but the whole circle
   of human ideas and principles was recognized by this lone wayfaring man.
   The first to urge extension of the principles of independence to the
   enslaved negro; the first to arraign monarchy, and to point out the danger
   of its survival in presidency; the first to propose articles of a more
   thorough nationality to the new-born States; the first to advocate
   international arbitration; the first to expose the absurdity and
   criminality of duelling; the first to suggest more rational ideas of
   marriage and divorce; the first to advocate national and international
   copyright; the first to plead for the animals; the first to demand justice
   for woman what brilliants would our modern reformers have contributed to a
   coronet for that man's brow, had he not presently worshipped the God of
   his fathers after the way that theologians called heresy!   "Be not
   righteous overmuch," saith cynical Solomon; "neither make thyself
   over-wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?"

                                   CHAPTER  V

                             LIBERTY AND EQUALITY 
                                     [1775]

   WITH regard to Paine's earliest publication there has been needless
   confusion. In his third Crisis he says to Lord Howe: "I have likewise an
   aversion to monarchy, as being too debasing to the dignity of man; but I
   never troubled others with my notions till very lately, nor ever published
   a syllable in England in my life." It has been alleged that this is
   inconsistent with his having written in 1772 "The Case of the Officers of
   Excise." But this, though printed (by William Lee of Lewes) was not
   published until 1793. It was a document submitted to Parliament, but never
   sold. The song on Wolfe, and other poetical pieces, though known to the
   Headstrong Club in Lewes, were first printed in Philadelphia.9

                           --------------------------

   In America Wolfe again rises before Paine's imagination. In
   the Pennsylvania Journal, January 4th, appears a brief "Dialogue between
   General Wolfe and General Gage in a Wood near Boston." Wolfe, from the
   Elysian Fields, approaches Gage with rebuke for the errand on which he has
   come to America, and reminds him that he is a citizen as well as a
   soldier. "If you have any regard for the glory of the British name, and if
   you prefer the society of Grecian, Roman, and British heroes in the world
   of spirits to the company of Jeffries, Kirk, and other royal executioners,
   I conjure you immediately to resign your commission."

   Although this "Dialogue" was the first writing of Paine published, it was
   not the first written for publication. The cause that first moved his
   heart and pen was that of the negro slave. Dr. Rush's date of his meeting
   with Paine, 1773, -- a year before his arrival, -- is one of a number of
   errors in his letter, among these being his report that Paine told him the
   anti-slavery essay was the first thing he had ever published. Paine no
   doubt told him it was the first thing he ever wrote and offered for
   publication; but it was not published until March 8th. Misled by Rush's
   words, Paine's editors and our historians of the anti-slavery movement
   have failed to discover this early manifesto of abolitionism. It is a most
   remarkable article. Every argument and appeal, moral, religious, military,
   economic, familiar in our subsequent anti-slavery struggle, is here found
   stated with eloquence and clearness. Having pointed out the horrors of the
   slave-trade and of slavery, he combats the argument that the practice was
   permitted to the Jews. Were such a plea allowed it would justify adoption
   of other Jewish practices utterly unlawful "under clearer light." The Jews
   indeed had no permission to enslave those who never injured them, but all
   such arguments are unsuitable "since the time of reformation came under
   Gospel light. All distinctions of nations, and privileges of one above
   others, are ceased. Christians are taught to account all men their
   neighbours, and love their neighbours as themselves; and do to all men as
   they would be done by; to do good to all men; and man-stealing is ranked
   with enormous crimes." Bradford might naturally hesitate some weeks before
   printing these pointed reproofs. "How just, how suitable to our crime is
   the punishment with which Providence threatens us?   We have enslaved
   multitudes, and shed much innocent blood, and now are threatened with the
   same." In the conclusion, a practical scheme is proposed for liberating
   all except the infirm who need protection, and settling them on frontier
   lands, where they would be friendly protectors instead of internal foes
   ready to help any invader who may offer them freedom.

   This wonderful article is signed "Justice and Humanity." Thomas Paine's
   venture in this direction was naturally welcomed by Dr. Rush, who some
   years before had written a little pamphlet against the slave trade, and
   deploring slavery, though he had not proposed or devised any plan for
   immediate emancipation. Paine's paper is as thorough as Garrison himself
   could have made it. And, indeed, it is remarkable that Garrison, at a time
   when he shared the common prejudices against Paine, printed at the head of
   his Liberator a motto closely resembling Paine's. The motto of Paine was:
   '"The world is my country, my religion is to do good"; that of the
   Liberator: "Our country is the world, our countrymen are all mankind."
   Garrison did characteristic justice to Paine when he had outgrown early
   prejudices against him.10 On April 12th, thirty-five days after Paine's
   plea for emancipation, the first American Antislavery Society was formed,
   in Philadelphia.

   Although the dialogue between Wolfe and Gage (January 4th) shows that
   Paine shared the feeling of America, the earlier numbers of
   his Pennsylvania Magazine prove his strong hope for reconciliation. That
   hope died in the first collision; after Lexington he knew well that
   separation was inevitable. A single sentence in the magazine intimates the
   change. The April number, which appeared soon after the "Lexington
   massacre," contains a summary of Chatham's speech, in which he said the
   crown would lose its lustre if "robbed of so principal a jewel as
   America." Paine adds this footnote: "The principal jewel of the crown
   actually dropt out at the coronation." There was probably no earlier
   printed suggestion of independence by any American.11

   There are three stages in the evolution of the Declaration of
   Independence. The colonies reached first the resolution of resistance,
   secondly of separation, and thirdly of republicanism.

   In the matter of resistance the distribution of honors has been rather
   literary than historical. In considering the beginnings of the Revolution
   our minds fly at once to the Tea-party in Boston harbor, then to
   Lexington, where seven Massachusetts men fell dead, and seven years of war
   followed. But two years before the tea was thrown overboard, and four
   years before the Lexington massacre, North Carolinians had encountered
   British troops, had left two hundred patriots fallen, and seen their
   leaders hanged for treason. Those earliest martyrs are almost forgotten
   because, in the first place, North Carolina produced no historians, poets,
   magazines, to rehearse their story from generation to generation. In the
   second place, the rebellion which Governor Tryon crushed at Alamance,
   though against the same oppressions, occurred in 1771, before the colonies
   had made common cause.

   Governmental anachronisms have a tendency to take refuge in colonies. Had
   Great Britain conceded to Americans the constitutional rights of
   Englishmen there could have been no revolution. Before the time of George
   III. British governors had repeatedly revived in America prerogatives
   extinct in England, but the colonists had generally been successful in
   their appeals to the home government. Even in 1774 the old statesmen in
   America had not realized that a king had come who meant to begin in
   America his mad scheme of governing as well as reigning. When, in
   September, 1774, the first Continental Congress assembled, its members
   generally expected to settle the troubles with the "mother country" by
   petitions to Parliament. There is poetic irony in the fact that the first
   armed resistance to royal authority in America was by the North Carolina
   "Regulators." On the frontiers, before official courts were established,
   some kind of law and order had to be maintained, and they were protected
   by a volunteer police called Regulators." In the forests of Virginia, two
   hundred years ago, Peter Lynch was appointed judge by his neighbors
   because of his wisdom and justice, and his decisions were enforced by
   "Regulators." Judge Lynch's honorable name is now degraded into a
   precedent for the cowardly ruffians who hunt down unarmed negroes,
   Italians, and Chinamen, and murder them without trial, or after their
   acquittal. But such was not the case with our frontier courts and
   "Regulators," which were civilized organizations, though unauthorized. For
   several years before the Revolution lawful and civilized government in
   some of the colonies depended on unauthorized administrations. The
   authorized powers were the "lynchers," as they would now be called, with
   traditional misrepresentation of Peter Lynch. The North Carolina
   Regulators of 1771 were defending the English constitution against a king
   and a governor acting as lawlessly as our vile lynchers and "White Caps."
   It was remarked, by Paine among others that after the royal authority was
   abolished, though for a long time new governments were not established,
   "order and harmony were preserved as inviolate as in any country in
   Europe."12

   In the dialogue between Wolfe and Gage, Paine writes as an Englishman; he
   lays no hand on the constitution, nor considers the sovereign involved in
   ministerial iniquities. Apart from his Quaker sentiments he felt dismay at
   a conflict which interrupted his lucrative school, and the literary
   opportunities afforded by his magazine. "For my own part," he wrote to
   Franklin, "I thought it very hard to have the country set on fire about my
   ears almost the moment I got into it." And indeed there was a general
   disgust among the patriots during the year 1775, while as yet no great aim
   or idea illumined the smoke of battle. They were vehemently protesting
   that they had no wish for separation from England, just as in the
   beginning of our civil war leading Unionists declared that they would not
   interfere with slavery. In March, 1775, Franklin maintained the assurance
   he had given Lord Chatham in the previous year, that he had never heard in
   America an expression in favor of independence, "from any person drunk or
   sober." Paine says that on his arrival he found an obstinate attachment to
   Britain; "it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it."
   "Independence was a doctrine scarce and rare even towards the conclusion
   of the year 1775." In May, George Washington, on his way to Congress, met
   the Rev. Jonathan Boucher, in the middle of the Potomac; while their boats
   paused, the clergyman warned his friend that the path on which he was
   entering might lead to separation from England. "If you ever hear of my
   joining in any such measures," said Washington, "you have my leave to set
   me down for everything wicked."13 Although Paine, as we shall see, had no
   reverence for the crown, and already foresaw American independence, he
   abhorred the method of war. In the first number of his magazine he writes:
   "The speeches of the different governors pathetically lament the present
   distracted state of affairs. Yet they breathe a spirit of mildness as well
   as tenderness, and give encouragement to hope that some happy method of
   accommodation may yet arise."

   But on April 19th came the "massacre at Lexington," as it was commonly
   called. How great a matter is kindled by a small fire! A man whose name
   remains unknown, forgetful of Captain Parker's order to his minutemen not
   to fire until fired on, drew his trigger on the English force advancing to
   Concord; the gun missed fire, but the little flash was answered by a
   volley; seven men lay dead. In the blood of those patriots at Lexington
   the Declaration of Independence was really written. From town-meetings
   throughout the country burning resolutions were hurled on General Gage in
   Boston, who had warned Major Pitcairn, commander of the expedition, not to
   assume the offensive. From one county, Mecklenburg, North Carolina, were
   sent to Congress twenty resolutions passed by its committee, May 31st,
   declaring "all laws and commissions confirmed by or derived from the
   authority of the King and Parliament are anulled and vacated," and that,
   "whatever person shall hereafter receive a commission from the crown, or
   attempt to exercise any such commission heretofore received, shall be
   deemed an enemy to his country."14

   Many years after the independence of America had been achieved, William
   Cobbett, on his return to England after a long sojourn in the United
   States, wrote as follows: 

   "As my Lord Grenville introduced the name of Burke, suffer me, my Lord, to
   introduce that of a man who put this Burke to shame, who drove him off the
   public stage to seek shelter in the pension list, and who is now named
   fifty million times where the name of the pensioned Burke is mentioned
   once. The cause of the American colonies was the cause of the English
   Constitution, which says that no man shall be taxed without his own
   consent. . . . A little thing sometimes produces a great effect; an insult
   offered to a man of great talent and unconquerable perseverance has in
   many instances produced, in the long run, most tremendous effects; and it
   appears to me very clear that some beastly insults, offered to Mr. Paine
   while he was in the Excise in England, was the real cause of the
   Revolution in America; for, though the nature of the cause of America was
   such as I have before described it; though the principles were firm in the
   minds of the people of that country; still, it was Mr. Paine, and Mr.
   Paine alone, who brought those principles into action."
   In this passage Cobbett was more epigrammatic than exact. Paine, though
   not fairly treated, as we have seen, in his final dismissal from the
   excise, was not insulted. But there is more truth in what Cobbett suggests
   as to Paine's part than he fully realized. Paine's unique service in the
   work of independence may now be more clearly defined. It was that he
   raised the Revolution into an evolution. After the "Lexington massacre"
   separation was talked of by many, but had it then occurred America might
   have been another kingdom. The members of Congress were of the rich
   conservative "gentry," and royalists. Had he not been a patriot, Peyton
   Randolph, our first president, would probably have borne a title like his
   father, and Washington would certainly have been knighted. Paine was in
   the position of the abolitionists when the secession war began. They also
   held peace principles, and would have scorned a war for the old
   slave-holding union, as Paine would have scorned a separation from England
   preserving its political institutions. The war having begun, and
   separation become probable, Paine hastened to connect it with humanity and
   with republicanism. As the abolitionists resolved that the secession war
   should sweep slavery out of the country, Paine made a brave effort that
   the Revolution should clear away both slavery and monarchy. It was to be
   in every respect a new departure for humanity. So he anticipated the
   Declaration of Independence by more than eight months with one of his own,
   which was discovered by Moreau in the file of the Pennsylvania
   Journal, October 18th.15 
   "A SERIOUS THOUGHT

   "When I reflect on the horrid cruelties exercised by Britain in the East
   Indies -- How thousands perished by artificial famine -- How religion and
   every manly principle of honor and honesty were sacrificed to luxury and
   pride -- When I read of the wretched natives being blown away, for no
   other crime than because, sickened with the miserable scene, they refused
   to fight -- When I reflect on these and a thousand instances of similar
   barbarity, I firmly believe that the Almighty, in compassion to mankind,
   will curtail the power of Britain.

   "And when I reflect on the use she hath made of the discovery of this new
   world -- that the little paltry dignity of earthly kings hath been set up
   in preference to the great cause of the King of kings -- That instead of
   Christian examples to the Indians, she hath basely tampered with their
   passions, imposed on their ignorance, and made them the tools of treachery
   and murder -- And when to these and many other melancholy reflections I
   add this sad remark, that ever since the discovery of America she hath
   employed herself in the most horrid of all traffics, that of human flesh,
   unknown to the most savage nations, hath yearly (without provocation and
   in cold blood) ravaged the hapless shores of Africa, robbing it of its
   unoffending inhabitants to cultivate her stolen dominions in the West --
   When I reflect on these, I hesitate not for a moment to believe that the
   Almighty will finally separate America from Britain. Call it Independancy
   or what you will, if it is the cause of God and humanity it will go on.

   "And when the Almighty shall have blest us, and made us a people dependent
   only upon ham, then may our first gratitude be shown by an act of
   continental legislation, which shall put a stop to the importation of
   Negroes for sale, soften the hard fate of those already here, and in time
   procure their freedom. 

   "HUMANUS

                                  CHAPTER  VI

                                "COMMON SENSE" 
                                     [1776]

   IN furrows ploughed deep by lawless despotism, watered with blood of
   patriots, the Thetford Quaker sowed his seed -- true English seed. Even
   while he did so he was suspected of being a British spy, and might have
   been roughly handled in Philadelphia had it not been for Franklin.
   Possibly this suspicion may have arisen from his having, in the
   anti-slavery letter, asked the Americans "to consider with what
   consistency or decency they complain so loudly of attempts to enslave
   them, while they hold so many thousands in slavery." Perfectly indifferent
   to this, Paine devoted the autumn of 1775 to his pamphlet "Common
   Sense," which with the new year "burst from the press with an effect which
   has rarely been produced by types and paper in any age or country." So
   says Dr. Benjamin Rush, and his assertion, often quoted, has as often been
   confirmed.

   Of the paramount influence of Paine's "Common Sense" there can indeed be
   no question.16 It reached Washington soon after tidings that Norfolk,
   Virginia, had been burned (Jan. 1st) by Lord Dunmore, as Falmouth (now
   Portland), Maine, had been, Oct. 17, 1775, by ships under Admiral Graves.
   The General wrote to Joseph Reed, from Cambridge, Jan. 31st: "A few more
   of such flaming arguments as were exhibited at Falmouth and Norfolk, added
   to the sound doctrine and unanswerable reasoning contained in the
   pamphlet `Common Sense,' will not leave numbers at a loss to decide upon
   the propriety of separation."17

   Henry Wisner, a New York delegate in Congress, sent the pamphlet to John
   McKesson, Secretary of the Provincial Congress sitting in New York City,
   with the following note: "Sir, I have only to ask the favour of you to
   read this pamphlet, consulting Mr. Scott and such of the Committee of
   Safety as you think proper, particularly Orange and Ulster, and let me
   know their and your opinion of the general spirit of it. I would have
   wrote a letter on the subject, but the bearer is waiting." In pursuance of
   this General Scott suggested a private meeting, and McKesson read the
   pamphlet aloud. New York, the last State to agree to separation, was
   alarmed by the pamphlet, and these leaders at first thought of answering
   it, but found themselves without the necessary arguments. Henry Wisner,
   however, required arguments rather than orders, and despite the
   instructions of his State gave New York the honor of having one name among
   those who, on July 4th, voted for independence.18 Joel Barlow, a student
   in Yale College at the beginning of the Revolution, has borne testimony to
   the great effect of Paine's pamphlet, as may be seen in his biography by
   Mr. Todd. An original copy of Paine's excise pamphlet (1792) in my
   possession contains a note in pencil, apparently contemporary, suggesting
   that the introduction was written by Barlow. In this introduction --
   probably by Barlow, certainly by a competent observer of events in America
   -- it is said: 

   "On this celebrated publication [`Common Sense'], which has received the
   testimony of praise from the wise and learned of different nations, we
   need only remark (for the merit of every work should be judged by its
   effect) that it gave spirit and resolution to the Americans, who were then
   wavering and undetermined, to assert their rights, and inspired a decisive
   energy into their counsels: we may therefore venture to say, without fear
   of contradiction, that the great American cause owed as much to the pen of
   Paine as to the sword of Washington."19
   Edmund Randolph, our first Attorney-General, who had been on Washington's
   staff in the beginning of the war, and conducted much of his
   correspondence, ascribed independence primarily to George III, but next to
   "Thomas Paine, an Englishman by birth, and possessing an imagination which
   happily combined political topics, poured forth in a style hitherto
   unknown on this side of the Atlantic, from the ease with which it
   insinuated itself into the hearts of the people who were unlearned, or of
   the learned."20 This is from a devout churchman, writing after Paine's
   death. Paine's malignant biographer, Cheetham (1809) is constrained to say
   of "Common Sense" : "Speaking a language which the colonists had felt but
   not thought, its popularity, terrible in its consequences to the parent
   country, was unexampled in the history of the press."21

   Let it not be supposed that Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Randolph, and
   the rest, were carried away by a meteor. Deep answers only unto deep.

   Paine's ideas went far because they came far. He was the authentic
   commoner, representing English freedom in the new world. There was no dreg
   in the poverty of his people that he had not tasted, no humiliation in
   their dependence, no outlook of their hopelessness, he had not known, and
   with the addition of intellectual hungers which made his old-world despair
   conscious. The squalor and abjectness of Thetford, its corporation held in
   the hollow of Grafton's hand, its members of Parliament also, the
   innumerable villages equally helpless, the unspeakable corruptions of the
   government, the repeated and always baffled efforts of the outraged people
   for some redress, -- these had been brought home to Paine in many ways,
   had finally driven him to America, where he arrived on the hour for which
   none had been so exactly and thoroughly trained. He had thrown off the old
   world, and that America had virtually done the same constituted its
   attraction for him. In the opening essay in his magazine, written within a
   month of his arrival in the country (Nov, 30, 1774), Paine speaks of
   America as a "nation," and his pregnant sentences prove how mature the
   principles of independence had become in his mind long before the outbreak
   of hostilities. 

   "America has now outgrown the state of infancy. Her strength and commerce
   make large advances to manhood; and science in all its branches has not
   only blossomed, but even ripened upon the soil. The cottages as it were of
   yesterday have grown to villages, and the villages to cities; and while
   proud antiquity, like a skeleton in rags, parades the streets of other
   nations, their genius, as if sickened and disgusted with the phantom,
   comes hither for recovery . . . America yet inherits a large portion of,
   her first-imported virtue. Degeneracy is here almost a useless word. Those
   who are conversant with Europe would be tempted to believe that even the
   air of the Atlantic disagrees with the constitution of foreign vices; if
   they survive the voyage they either expire on their arrival, or linger
   away in an incurable consumption. There is a happy something in the
   climate of America which disarms them all their power both of infection
   and attraction."
   In presently raising the standard of republican independence, Paine speaks
   of separation from England as a foregone conclusion. "I have always
   considered the independency of this continent as an event which sooner or
   later must arrive." Great Britain having forced a collision, the very
   least that America can demand is separation. 

   "The object contended for ought always to bear some just proportion to the
   expence. The removal of North, or the whole detestable junto, is a matter
   unworthy the millions we have expended. A temporary stoppage of trade was
   an inconvenience which would have sufficiently ballanced the repeal of all
   the acts complained of, had such repeals been obtained; but if the whole
   Continent must take up arms, if every man must be a soldier, 't is
   scarcely worth our while to fight against; a contemptible ministry only.
   Dearly, dearly do we pay for the repeal of the acts, if that is all we
   fight for; for, in a just estimation, 't is as great a folly to pay a
   Bunker-hill price for law as for land . . . . It would be policy in the
   king, at ''this time, to repeal the acts for the sake of reinstating
   himself in the government of the provinces, in order that he may''
   accomplish by craft and subtlety, in the long run, what he cannot do by
   force and violence in the short one. Reconciliation and ruin are nearly
   related."
   Starting with the lowest demand, separation, Paine shows the justice and
   necessity of it lying fundamentally in the nature of monarchy as
   represented by Great Britain, and the potential republicanism of colonies
   composed of people from all countries. The keynote of this is struck in
   the introduction. The author withholds his name "because the object of
   attention is the Doctrine itself, not the Man"; and he affirms, "the cause
   of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind."

   No other pamphlet published during the Revolution is comparable
   with "Common Sense" for; interest to the reader of to-day, or for value as
   an historical document. Therein as in a mirror is beheld the almost
   incredible England, against which the colonies contended. And therein is
   reflected the moral, even religious, enthusiasm which raised the struggle
   above the paltriness of a rebellion against taxation to a great human
   movement, -- a war for an idea. The art with which every sentence is
   feathered for its aim is consummate.

   The work was for a time generally attributed to Franklin. It is said the
   Doctor was reproached by a loyal lady for using in it such an epithet as
   "the royal brute of Britain." He assured her that he had not written the
   pamphlet, and would never so dishonor the brute creation.

   In his letter to Cheetham (1809) already referred to, Dr. Rush claims to
   have suggested the work to Paine, who read the sheets to him and also to
   Dr. Franklin. This letter, however, gives so many indications of an
   enfeebled memory, that it cannot be accepted against Paine's own
   assertion, made in the year following the publication of "Common
   Sense," when Dr. Rush and Dr. Franklin might have denied it. 

   "In October, 1775, Dr. Franklin proposed giving me such materials as were
   in his hands towards completing a history of the present transactions, and
   seemed desirous of having the first volume out the next spring. I had then
   formed the outlines of`Common Sense,' and finished nearly the first part;
   and as I supposed the doctor's design in getting out a history was to open
   the new year with a new system, I expected to surprise him with a
   production on that subject much earlier than he thought of; and without
   informing him of what I was doing, got it ready for the press as fast as I
   conveniently could, and sent him the first pamphlet that was printed off."
   On the other hand, Paine's memory was at fault when he wrote (December 3,
   1802): "In my publications, I follow the rule I began with in 'Common
   Sense,' that is, to consult nobody, nor to let anybody see what I write
   till it appears publicly." This was certainly his rule, but in the case of
   "Common Sense" he himself mentions (Penn. Jour., April 10, 1776) having
   shown parts of the MS. to a "very few." Dr. Rush is correct in his
   statement that Paine had difficulty in finding "a printer who had boldness
   enough to publish it," and that he (Rush) mentioned the pamphlet to the
   Scotch bookseller, Robert Bell. For Bell says, in a contemporary leaflet:
   "When the work was at a stand for want of a courageous Typographer, I was
   then recommended by a gentleman nearly in the following words: 'There is
   Bell, he is a Republican printer, give it to him, and I will answer for
   his courage to print it.' " Dr. Rush probably required some knowledge of
   the contents of the pamphlet before he made this recommendation.

   That Dr. Rush is mistaken in saying the manuscript was submitted to
   Franklin, and a sentence modified by him, is proved by the fact that on
   February 19th, more than a month after the pamphlet appeared, Franklin
   introduced Paine to Gen. Charles Lee with a letter containing the words,
   "He is the reputed and, I think, the real author of 'Common sense.' "
   Franklin could not have thus hesitated had there been in the work anything
   of his own, or anything he had seen. Beyond such disclosures to Dr. Rush,
   and one or two others, as were necessary to secure publication, Paine kept
   the secret of his authorship as long as he could. His recent arrival in
   the country might have impaired the force of his pamphlet. The authorship
   of "Common Sense" was guessed by the "Tory" President of the University of
   Philadelphia, the Rev. William Smith, D.D., who knew pretty well the
   previous intellectual resources of that city. Writing under the name of
   "Cato" he spoke of "the foul pages of interested writers, and strangers
   intermeddling in our affairs." To which "The Forester" (Paine) answers: "A
   freeman, Cato, is a stranger nowhere, -- a slave, everywhere."22

   The publication of "Common Sense" had been followed by a number of
   applauding pamphlets, some of them crude or extravagant, from Bell's
   press. "Cato" was anxious to affiliate these "additional doses" on the
   author of "Common Sense," who replies: 
   "Perhaps there never was a pamphlet, since the use of letters were known,
   about which so little pains were taken, and of which so great a number
   went off in so short a time. I am certain that I am within compass when I
   say one hundred and twenty thousand. The book was turned upon the world
   like an orphan to shift for itself; no plan was formed to support it,
   neither hath the author ever published a syllable on the subject from that
   time till after the appearance of Cato's fourth letter."
   This letter of "The Forester" is dated April 8th (printed on the 10th).
   "Common Sense," published January loth, had, therefore, in less than three
   months, gained this sale. In the end probably half a million copies were
   sold. In reply to "Cato's" sneer about "interested writers," Paine did not
   announce the fact that he had donated the copyright to the States for the
   cause of independence. It was sold at two shillings, and the author thus

   gave away a fortune in that pamphlet alone. It never brought him a penny;
   he must even have paid for copies himself, as the publisher figured up a
   debt against him, on account of "Common Sense," for -L-29 12s. 1d.
   Notwithstanding this experience and the popularity he had acquired, Paine
   also gave to the States the copyright of his Crisis (thirteen numbers),
   was taunted by Tories as a "garreteer," ate his crust contentedly, peace
   finding him a penniless patriot, who might easily have had fifty thousand
   pounds in his pocket.

   The controversy between "Cato" and "The Forester" was the most important
   that preceded the Declaration of Independence. The president of the
   University represented "Toryism" in distress. The "massacre at Lexington"
   disabled him from justifying the government, which, however, he was not
   prepared to denounce. He was compelled to assume the tone of an American,
   while at the same time addressing his appeal "To the People of
   Pennsylvania," trying to detach its non-resident Quakers and its
   mercantile interest from sympathy with the general cause. Having a bad
   case, in view of Lexington, he naturally resorted to abuse of the
   plaintiff's attorney. He soon found that when it came to Quaker sentiment
   and dialect, his unknown antagonist was at home. 

   "Remember, thou hast thrown me the glove, Cato, and either thee or I must
   tire. I fear not the field of fair debate, but thou hast stepped aside and
   made it personal. Thou hast tauntingly called me by name; and if I cease
   to hunt thee from every lane and lurking hole of mischief, and bring thee
   not a trembling culprit before the public bar, then brand me with reproach
   by naming me in the list of your confederates."

   "The Forester" declares his respect for the honest and undisguised
   opponents of independence. "To be nobly wrong is more manly than to be
   meanly right." But "Cato" wears the mask of a friend, and shall be proved
   a foe.

   The so-called "Tories" of the American Revolution have never had justice
   done them. In another work I have told the story of John Randolph, King's
   Attorney in Virginia, and there were many other martyrs of loyalty in
   those days23. Four months after the affair at Lexington, Thomas Jefferson
   wrote to John Randolph, in London: "Looking with fondness towards a
   reconciliation with Great Britain, I cannot help hoping you may be able to
   contribute towards expediting the good work." This was written on August
   25, 1775; and if this was the feeling of Jefferson only ten months before
   the Declaration, how many, of more moderate temper, surrounded "Cato" and
   "The Forester" in loyal and peace-loving Philadelphia? But "Cato" was
   believed ungenuine. The Rev. Dr. William Smith, who wrote under that name,
   a native of Aberdeen with an Oxonian D.D., had been a glowing Whig patriot
   until June, 1775. But his wife was a daughter of the loyalist, William
   Moore. This lady of fashion was distinguished by her contempt for the
   independents, and her husband, now near fifty, was led into a false
   position.24 He held the highest literary position in Philadelphia, and
   perhaps felt some jealousy of Paine's fame. He picked out all the mistakes
   he could find in "Common Sense," and tried in every way to belittle his
   antagonist. Himself a Scotchman, his wife an Englishwoman, he sneered at
   Paine for being a foreigner; having modified his principles to those of
   the loyalist's daughter, he denounced Paine as an "interested writer." He
   was out of his element in the controversy he began with personalities. He
   spoke of the trouble as a lovers' quarrel. Paine answers: 

   "It was not in the power of France or Spain, or all the other powers in
   Europe, to have given such a wound, or raised us to such mortal hatred as
   Britain hath done. We see the same kind of undescribed anger at her
   conduct, as we would at the sight of an animal devouring its young."
   The strongest point of "Cato" was based on the proposed embassy for
   negotiation, and he demanded reverence for "Ambassadors coming to
   negotiate a peace." To this "The Forester" replied:

   "Cato discovers a gross ignorance of the British Constitution in supposing
   that these men can be empowered to act as ambassadors. To prevent his
   future errors, I will set him right. The present war differs from every
   other, in this instance, viz., that it is not carried on under the
   prerogative of the crown, as other wars have always been, but under the
   authority of the whole legislative power united; and as the barriers which
   stand in the way of a negotiation are not proclamations, but acts of
   Parliament, it evidently follows that were even the King of England here
   in person, he could not ratify the terms or conditions of a
   reconciliation; because, in the single character of King, he could not
   tipulate for the repeal of any acts of Parliament, neither can the
   Parliament stipulate for him. There is no body of men more jealous of
   their privileges than the Commons: Because they sell them."
   Paine wrote three letters in reply to "Cato," the last of which contained
   a memorable warning to the people on the eve of the Declaration of
   Independence: "Forget not the hapless African." That was forgotten, but
   the summing up made Dr. William Smith an object of detestation. He never
   ventured into political controversy again, and when he returned from exile
   to Philadelphia, a penitent patriot, he found his old antagonist, Thomas
   Paine, honored by a degree from the University of Pennsylvania into which
   the college bad been absorbed.

   On May 8th a fourth letter, signed "The Forester," appeared in the same
   paper (Pennsylvania Journal), which I at first suspected of not being from
   Paine's pen.26 This was because of a sentence beginning: "The clergy of
   the English Church, of which I profess myself a member," etc. There is no
   need to question the truth of this, for, as we have seen, Paine had been
   confirmed, and no doubt previously baptized; nor is there reason to
   disbelieve the statement of Oldys that he wished to enter holy orders.
   There was a good deal of rationalism in the American church at that time,
   and that Paine, with his religious fervor and tendency to inquire, should
   have maintained his place in that scholarly church is natural. His
   quakerism was a philosophy, but he could by no means have found any home
   in its rigid and dogmatic societies in Philadelphia. The casual sentence
   above quoted was probably inserted for candor, as the letter containing it
   opens with a censure on the attitude of the Quakers towards the proposal
   for independence. The occasion was an election of four burgesses to
   represent Philadelphia in the State Assembly, a body in which Quakers
   (loyalists) preponderated. Had the independents been elected they must
   have taken the oath of allegiance to the crown, with which the State was
   at war. Indeed Paine declares that the "Tories" succeeded in the election
   because so many patriots were absent for defence of their country. Under
   these circumstances Paine urges the necessity of a popular convention. The
   House of Assembly is disqualified from "sitting in its own case."

   The extracts given from this letter are of historic interest as reflecting
   the conflict of opinions in Pennsylvania amid which the Declaration was
   passed two months later.

   "Whoever will take the trouble of attending to the progress and
   changeability of times and things, and the conduct of mankind thereon,
   will find that extraordinary circumstances do sometimes arise before us,
   of a species, either so purely natural or so perfectly original, that none
   but the man of nature can understand them. When precedents fail to assist
   us, we must return to the first principles of things for information, and
   think, as if we were the first men that thought. And this is the true
   reason, that in the present state of affairs, the wise are become foolish,
   and the foolish wise. I am led to this reflection by not being able to
   account for the conduct of the Quakers on any other; for although they do
   not seem to perceive it themselves, yet it is amazing to hear with what
   unanswerable ignorance many of that body, wise in other matters, will
   discourse on the present one. Did they hold places or commissions under
   the king, were they governors of provinces, or had they any interest
   apparently distinct from us, the mystery would cease; but as they have
   not, their folly is best attributed to that superabundance of worldly
   knowledge which in original matters is too cunning to be wise. Back to the
   first plain path of nature, friends, and begin anew, for in this business
   your first footsteps were wrong. You have now travelled to the summit of
   inconsistency, and that, with such accelerated rapidity as to acquire
   autumnal ripeness by the first of May. Now your rotting time comes on."
   "The Forester" reminds the Quakers of their predecessors who, in 1704,
   defended the rights of the people against the proprietor. He warns them
   that the people, though unable to vote, represent a patriotic power
   tenfold the strength of Toryism, by which they will not submit to be
   ruled.

   "He that is wise will reflect, that the safest asylum, especially in times
   of general convulsion, when no settled form of government prevails, is the
   love of the people. All property is safe under their protection. Even in
   countries where the lowest and most licentious of them have risen into
   outrage, they have never departed from the path of natural honor.

   Volunteers unto death in defence of the person or fortune of those who had
   served or defended them, division of property never entered the mind of
   the populace. It is incompatible with that spirit which impels them into
   action. An avaricious mob was never heard of; nay, even a miser, pausing
   in the midst of them, and catching their spirit, would from that instant
   cease to be covetous."
   The Quakers of Pennsylvania and New Jersey had held a congress in
   Philadelphia and issued (January 20th) "The Ancient Testimony and
   Principles of the People called Quakers renewed, with respect to the King
   and Government; and touching the Commotions now prevailing in these and
   other Parts of America; addressed to the People in General." Under this
   lamb-like tract, and its bleat of texts, was quite discoverable the "Tory"
   wolf; but it was widely circulated and became a danger. The Quakers of
   Rhode Island actually made efforts to smuggle provisions into Boston
   during the siege. Paine presently reviewed this testimony in a pamphlet,
   one extract from which will show that he could preach a better Quaker
   sermon than any of them: 

   "O ye partial ministers of your own acknowledged principles!   If the
   bearing arms be sinful, the first going to war must be more so, by all the
   difference between wilful attack and unavoidable defence. Wherefore, if ye
   really preach from conscience, and mean not to make a political hobbyhorse
   of your religion, convince the world thereof by proclaiming your doctrine
   to our enemies, for they likewise bear arms. Give us proof of your
   sincerity by publishing it at St. James's, to the commanders in chief at
   Boston, to the admirals and captains who are piratically ravaging our
   coasts, and to all the murdering miscreants who are acting in authority
   under HIM whom ye profess to serve. Had ye the honest soul of Barclay ye
   would preach repentance to your king; ye would tell the Royal Wretch his
   sins, and warn him of eternal ruin; ye would not spend your partial
   invectives against the injured and insulted only, but, like faithful
   ministers, cry aloud and spare none."27

                                  CHAPTER  VII

                       UNDER THE BANNER OF INDEPENDENCE 
                                  [1776-1777]

   AS in North Carolina had occurred the first armed resistance to British
   oppressions (1771), and its Mecklenburg County been the first to organize
   a government independent of the Crown, so was that colony the first to
   instruct its delegates in Congress to vote for national independence. She
   was followed in succession by South Carolina28, Virginia29, Massachusetts,
   Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Georgia, New Jersey, Delaware,
   and Pennsylvania. Maryland passed patriotic resolutions, but not
   sufficiently decisive for its delegates to act. New York alone forbade its
   delegates to vote for independence.

   Meanwhile, on June 7th, Richard Henry Lee, in behalf of the Virginians,
   had submitted resolutions of independence; but as six States hesitated,
   Congress adjourned the decision until July 1st, appointing, however, (June
   11th) a committee to consider the proper form of the probable Declaration
   -- Jefferson, John Adams, Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R.
   Livingston. But this interval, from June 7th to July 1st, was perilous for
   independence. News came of the approach of Lord Howe bearing from England
   the "olive branch." The powerful colonies New York and Pennsylvania were
   especially anxious to await the proposals for peace. At this juncture
   Paine issued one of his most effective pamphlets, "A Dialogue between the
   Ghost of General Montgomery, Just Arrived from the Elysian Fields, and an
   American Delegate, in a Wood near Philadelphia." Montgomery, the first
   heroic figure fallen in the war, reproaches the hesitating delegate for
   willingness to accept pardon from a royal criminal for defending "the
   rights of humanity." He points out that France only awaits their
   declaration of independence to come to their aid, and that America "teems
   with patriots, heroes, and legislators who are impatient to burst forth
   into light and importance." The most effective part of the pamphlet,
   however, was a reply to the commercial apprehensions of New York and
   Pennsylvania. "Your dependance upon the Crown is no advantage, but rather
   an injury, to the people of Great Britain, as it increases the power and
   influence of the King. The people are benefited only by your trade, and
   this they may have after you are independant of the Crown." There is a
   shrewd prescience of what actually happened shown in this opportune work.
   Of course the gallant ghost remarks that "monarchy and aristocracy have in
   all ages been the vehicles of slavery." The allusion to the arming of
   negroes and Indians against America, and other passages, resemble clauses
   in one of the paragraphs eliminated from the original Declaration of
   Independence.

   At this time Paine saw much of Jefferson, and there can be little doubt
   that the anti-slavery clause struck out of the Declaration was written by
   Paine, or by some one who had Paine's anti-slavery essay before him. In
   the following passages it will be observed that the antitheses are nearly
   the same -- "infidel and Christian," "heathen and Christian."

   them, thus paying off former crimes 
   committed against the LIBERTIES

   urges them to commit against the 
   LIVES of another."
   Thus did Paine try to lay at the corner the stone which the builders
   rejected, and which afterwards ground their descendants to powder.
   Jefferson withdrew the clause on the objection of Georgia and South
   Carolina, which wanted slaves, and of Northerners interested in supplying
   them. That, however, was not known till all the parties were dead. Paine
   had no reason to suppose that the Declaration of human freedom and
   equality, passed July 4th, could fail eventually to include the African
   slaves. The Declaration embodied every principle he had been asserting,
   and indeed Cobbett is correct in saying that whoever may have written the
   Declaration Paine was its author. The world being his country, and America
   having founded its independence on such universal interests, Paine could
   not hesitate to become a soldier for mankind.30 His Quaker principles,
   always humanized, were not such as would applaud a resistance in which he
   was not prepared to participate. While the signers of the Declaration of
   Independence were affixing their names -- a procedure which reached from
   August 2d into November -- Paine resigned his Pennsylvania Magazine, and
   marched with his musket to the front. He enlisted in a Pennsylvania
   division of the Flying Camp of ten thousand men, who were to be sent
   wherever needed. He was under General Roberdeau, and assigned at first to
   service at Amboy, afterwards at Bergen. The Flying Camp was enlisted for a
   brief period, and when that had expired Paine travelled to Fort Lee, on
   the Hudson, and renewed his enlistment. Fort Lee was under the command of
   General Nathaniel Greene who, on or about September 19th, appointed Paine
   a Volunteer Aide-de-camp, General Greene in a gossipy letter to his wife
   (November 2d) says: "Common Sense (Thomas Paine) and Colonel Snarl, or
   Cornwell, are perpetually wrangling about mathematical problems." On
   November 10th came the surprise of Fort Lee; the boiling kettles and
   baking ovens of a dinner to be devoured by the British were abandoned,
   with three hundred tents, for a retreat made the more miserable by hunger
   and cold. By November 22d the whole army had retreated to Newark, where
   Paine began writing his famous first Crisis.31

   He could only write at night; during the day there was constant work for
   every soldier of the little force surrounding Washington. "I am wearied
   almost to death with the retrograde motion of things," wrote Washington to
   his brother (November 9th), "and I solemnly protest that a pecuniary
   reward of twenty thousand pounds a year would not induce me to undergo
   what I do; and after all, perhaps to lose my character, as it is
   impossible, under such a variety of distressing circumstances, to conduct
   matters agreeably to public expectation." On November 27th he writes from
   Newark to General Lee: "It has been more owing to the badness of the
   weather that the enemy's progress has been checked, than to any resistance
   we could make." Even while he wrote the enemy drew near, and the next day
   (November 28th) entered one end of Newark as Washington left the other. At
   Brunswick he was joined by General Williamson's militia, and on the
   Delaware by the Philadelphia militia, and could muster five thousand
   against Howe's whole army. "I tremble for Philadelphia," writes Washington
   to Lund Washington (December 10th). "Nothing in my opinion, but General
   Lee's speedy arrival, who has been long expected, though still at a
   distance (with about three thousand men), can save it." On December 13th
   Lee was a prisoner, and on the 17th Washington writes to the same
   relative: 

   "Your imagination can scarce extend to a situation more distressing than
   mine. Our only dependence now is upon the speedy enlistment of a new army.
   If this fails, I think the game will be pretty well up, as from
   disaffection and want of spirit and fortitude, the inhabitants, instead of
   resistance, are offering submission and taking protection from Gen. Howe
   in Jersey."
   The day before, he had written to the President of Congress that the
   situation was critical, and the distresses of his soldiers "extremely
   great, many of 'em being entirely naked and most so thinly clad as to be
   unfit for service." On December 18th he writes to his brother: 

   "You can form no idea of the perplexity of my situation. No man, I
   believe, ever had a greater choice of difficulties, and less means to
   extricate himself from them. However, under a full persuasion of the
   justice of our cause, I cannot entertain an Idea that it will finally
   sink, tho' it may remain for some time under a cloud."
   Under that cloud, by Washington's side, was silently at work the force
   that lifted it. Marching by day, listening to the consultations of
   Washington and his generals, Paine wrote by the camp fires; the winter
   storms, the Delaware's waves, were mingled with his ink; the half-naked
   soldiers in their troubled sleep dreaming of their distant homes, the
   skulking deserter creeping off in the dusk, the pallid face of the
   heavy-hearted commander, made the awful shadows beneath which was written
   that leaflet which went to the Philadelphia printer along with
   Washington's last foreboding letters to his relatives in Virginia. It was
   printed on December 19th32, and many copies reached the camp above Trenton
   Falls on the eve of that almost desperate attack on which Washington had
   resolved. On the 23d December he wrote to Colonel Joseph Reed: 

   "Christmas-day, at night, one hour before day, is the time fixed upon for
   our attempt on Trenton. For Heaven's sake keep this to yourself, as the
   discovery of it may prove fatal to us; our numbers, sorry I am to say,
   being less than I had any conception of; but necessity, dire necessity
   will, nay must, justify any attempt."
   America has known some utterances of the lips equivalent to decisive
   victories in the field, -- as some of Patrick Henry's, and the address of
   President Lincoln at Gettysburg. But of utterances by the pen none have
   achieved such vast results as Paine's "Common Sense" and his first Crisis.
   Before the battle of Trenton the half-clad, disheartened soldiers of
   Washington were called together in groups to listen to that thrilling
   exhortation. The opening words alone were a victory. 

   "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the
   sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his
   country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man
   and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this
   consolation with us, that the harder the conflict the more glorious the
   triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly; 't is dearness
   only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper
   price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an
   article as Freedom should not be highly rated."

   Not a chord of faith, or love, or hope was left untouched. The very faults
   of the composition, which the dilettanti have picked out, were effective
   to men who had seen Paine on the march, and knew these things were written
   in sleepless intervals of unwearied labors. He speaks of what Joan of Arc
   did in "the fourteenth century," and exclaims: "Would that heaven might
   inspire some Jersey maid to spirit up her countrymen, and save her fair
   fellow sufferers from ravage and ravishment!" Joan was born in 1410, but
   Paine had no cyclopaedia in his knapsack. The literary musket reaches its
   mark. The pamphlet was never surpassed for true eloquence -- that is, for
   the power that carries its point. With skilful illustration of lofty
   principles by significant details, all summed with simplicity and
   sympathy, three of the most miserable weeks ever endured by men were
   raised into epical dignity. The wives, daughters, mothers, sisters, seemed
   stretching out appealing hands against the mythically monstrous Hessians.
   The great commander, previously pointed to as "a mind that can even
   flourish upon care," presently saw his dispirited soldiers beaming with
   hope, and bounding to the onset, -- their watchword: These are the times
   that try men's souls!  Trenton was won, the Hessians captured, and a New
   Year broke for America on the morrow of that Christmas Day, 1776.33

   Paine's Trenton musket had hardly cooled, or the pen of his
   first Crisis dried, before he began to write another. It appeared about
   four weeks after the battle and is addressed to Lord Howe. The Thetford
   mechanic has some pride in confronting this English lord who had offered
   the Americans mercy. "Your lordship, I find, has now commenced author, and
   published a Proclamation; I have published a Crisis." The rumors of his
   being a hireling scribe, or gaining wealth by his publications, made it
   necessary for Paine to speak of himself at the conclusion

   "What I write is pure nature, and my pen and my soul have ever gone
   together. My writings I have always given away, receiving only the expense
   of printing and paper, and sometimes not even that. I never counted either
   fame or interest, and my manner of life, to those who know it, will
   justify what I say. My study is to be useful, and if your lordship loves
   mankind as well as I do, you would, seeing you cannot conquer us, cast
   about and lend your hand towards accomplishing a peace. Our independence,
   with God's blessing, we will maintain against all the world; but as we
   wish to avoid evil ourselves, we wish not to inflict it on others. I am
   never over-inquisitive into the secrets of the cabinet, but I have some
   notion that, if you neglect the present opportunity, it will not be in our
   power to make a separate peace with you afterwards; for whatever treaties
   or alliances we form we shall most faithfully abide by; wherefore you may
   be deceived if you think you can make it with us at any time."
   Thus the humble author of the Crisis offers the noble author of the
   Proclamation "mercy," on condition of laying down his arms, and going
   home; but it must be at once!

   If Howe, as is most likely, considered this mere impudence, he presently
   had reason to take it more seriously. For there were increasing
   indications that Paine was in the confidence of those who controlled
   affairs. On January 21st he was appointed by the Council of Safety in
   Philadelphia secretary to the commission sent by Congress to treat with
   the Indians at Easton, Pennsylvania. The commissioners, with a thousand
   dollars' worth of presents, met the Indian chiefs in the German Reformed
   Church (built 1776), and, as they reported to Congress, "after shaking
   hands, drinking rum, while the organ played, we proceeded to business."34

   The report was, no doubt, written by Paine, who for his services was paid
   -L-300 by the Pennsylvania Assembly (one of its advances for Congress,
   afterwards refunded). In a public letter, written in 1807, Paine relates
   an anecdote concerning this meeting with the Indians. 

   "The chief of the tribes, who went by the name of King Last-night, because
   his tribe had sold their lands, had seen some English men-of-war in some
   of the waters of Canada, and was impressed with the power of those great
   canoes; but he saw that the English made no progress against us by land.
   This was enough for an Indian to form an opinion by. He could speak some
   English, and in conversation with me, alluding to the great canoes, he
   gave me his idea of the power of a king of England, by the following
   metaphor. `The king of England,' said he, `is like a fish. When he is in
   the water he can wag his tail; when he comes on land he lays down on his
   side.'   Now if the English government had but half the sense this Indian
   had, they would not have sent Duckworth to Constantinople, and Douglas to
   Norfolk, to lay down on their side."
   On April 17th, when Congress transformed the "Committee of Secret
   Correspondence" into the "Committee of Foreign Affairs," Paine was elected
   its secretary. His friend, Dr. Franklin, had reached France in December,
   1776, where Arthur Lee and Silas Deane were already at work. Lord Howe
   might, indeed, have done worse than take Paine's advice concerning the
   "opportunity," which did not return. General Howe did, indeed, presently
   occupy a fine abode in Philadelphia, but only kept it warm, to be
   afterwards the executive mansion of President Washington.

                                 CHAPTER  VIII

                             SOLDIER AND SECRETARY 
                                   [1777-78]

   AFTER their disaster at Trenton, the English forces suspended hostilities
   for a long time. Paine, maintaining his place on General Greene's staff,
   complied with the wish of all the generals by wielding his pen during the
   truce of arms. He sat himself down in Philadelphia, "Second Street,
   opposite the Quaker meeting," -- as he writes the address. The Quakers
   regarded him as Antichrist pursuing them into close quarters. Untaught by
   castigation, the leaders of the Society, and chiefly one John Pemberton,
   disguised allies of the Howes, had put forth, November 20, 1776, a second
   and more dangerous "testimony." In it they counsel Friends to refuse
   obedience to whatever "instructions or ordinances" may be published, not
   warranted by "that happy constitution under which they and others long
   enjoyed tranquillity and peace." In his second Crisis (January 13, 1777)
   Paine refers to this document, and a memorial, from "a meeting of a
   reputable number of the inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia," called
   attention of the Board of Safety to its treasonable character. The Board,
   however, not having acted, Paine devoted his next three months to a
   treatment of that and all other moral and political problems which had
   been developed by the course of the Revolution, and must be practically
   dealt with. In reading this third Crisis, one feels in every sentence its
   writer's increased sense of responsibility. Events had given him the seat
   of a lawgiver. His first pamphlet had dictated the Declaration of
   Independence, his second had largely won its first victory, his third had
   demonstrated the impossibility of subjugation, and offered England peace
   on the only possible terms. The American heart had responded without a
   dissonant note; he held it in his hand; he knew that what he was writing
   in that room "opposite the Quaker meeting" were Acts of Congress. So it
   proved. The third Crisis was dated April 19, 1777, the second anniversary
   of the first collision (Lexington). It was as effective in dealing with
   the internal enemies of the country as the first had been in checking its
   avowed foes. It was written in a city still largely, if not
   preponderantly, "tory," and he deals with them in all their varieties, not
   arraigning the Friends as a Society. Having carefully shown that
   independence, from being a natural right, had become a political and moral
   necessity, and the war one "on which a world is staked," he says that
   "Tories" endeavoring to insure their property with the enemy should be
   made to fear still more losing it on the other side. Paine proposes an
   "oath or affirmation" renouncing allegiance to the King, pledging support
   to the United States. At the same time let a tax of ten, fifteen, or
   twenty percent. believed on all property. Each who takes the oath may
   exempt his property by holding himself ready to do what service he can for
   the cause; they who refuse the oath will be paying a tax on their
   insurance with the enemy. 

   "It would not only be good policy but strict justice to raise fifty or one
   hundred thousand pounds, or more, if it is necessary, out of the estates
   and property of the King of England's votaries, resident in Philadelphia,
   to be distributed as a reward to those inhabitants of the city and State
   who should turn out and repulse the enemy should they attempt to march
   this way."
   These words were written at a moment when a vigorous opposition, in and
   out of Congress, was offered to Washington's Proclamation (Morristown,
   January 25, 1777,) demanding that an oath of allegiance to the United
   States should be required of all who had taken such an oath to the King,
   non-jurors to remove within the enemy's lines, or be treated as enemies.
   Paine's proposal was partly followed on June 13th, when Pennsylvania
   exacted an oath of allegiance to the State from all over eighteen years of
   age.

   Paine was really the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. His election had not
   been without opposition, and, according to John Adams, there was a
   suggestion that some of his earlier writings had been unfavorable to this
   country. What the reference was I cannot understand unless it was to his
   anti-slavery essay, in which he asked Americans with what consistency they
   could protest against being enslaved while they were enslaving others.
   That essay, I have long believed, caused a secret, silent, hostility to
   the author by which he suffered much without suspecting it. But he was an
   indefatigable secretary. An example of the care with which foreign
   representatives were kept informed appears in a letter to William Bingham,
   agent of Congress at Martinique. 

   "PHILADELPHIA, July 16th, 1777.

   SIR,

   A very sudden opportunity offers of sending you the News-papers, from
   which you will collect the situation of our Affairs. The Enemy finding
   their attempt of marching thro' the Jersies to this City impracticable,
   have retreated to Staten Island seemingly discontented and dispirited and
   quite at a loss what step next to pursue. Our Army is now well recruited
   and formidable. Our Militia in the several States ready at a day's notice
   to turn out and support the Army when occasion requires; and tho' we
   cannot, in the course of a Campaign, expect everything in the several
   Parts of the Continent, to go just as we wish it; yet the general face of
   our Affairs assures us of final success.

   "In the Papers of June 18th & 25 and July 2d you will find Genl.
   Washington and Arnold's Letters of the Enemy's movement in, and retreat
   from the Jersies. We are under some apprehensions for Ticonderoga, as we
   find the Enemy are unexpectedly come into that Quarter. The Congress have
   several times had it in contemplation to remove the Garrison from that
   Place -- as by Experience we find that Men shut up in Forts are not of so
   much use as in the field, especially in the highlands where every hill is
   a natural fortification.

   "I am Sir Your Obt. Humble Servt. 

   "THOMAS PAINE."

   Secretary. to the Committee for Foreign Affairs."35
   After the occupation of Philadelphia by the British (September 26, 1777),
   Paine had many adventures, as we shall presently see. He seems to have
   been with Washington at Valley Forge when the Pennsylvania Assembly and
   President (Thomas Wharton, Jr.,) confided to him the delicate and arduous
   task assigned by the following from Timothy Matlack, Secretary of the
   Assembly: 

   "LANCASTER, Oct. 10, 1777.

   SIR,

   The Hon'ble house of As'y have proposed and Council have adopted a plan of
   obtaining more regular and constant intelligence of the proceeding of Gen.
   Washington's army than has hitherto been had. Everyone agrees that you are
   the proper person for this purpose, and I am directed by his Exc'y, the
   pr't, to write to you hereon (the Prs't being engaged in writing to the
   Gen'l, and the Express in waiting).

   "The Assembly have agreed to make you a reasonable compensation for your
   services in this business, if you think proper to engage in it, which I
   hope you will; as it is a duty of importance that there are few, however
   well disposed, who are capable of doing in a manner that will answer all
   the intentions of it -- perhaps a correspondence of this kind may be the
   fairest opportunity of giving to Council some important hints that may
   occur to you on interesting subjects.

   "Proper expresses will be engaged in this business. If the expresses which
   pass from headquarters to Congress can be made use of so much the better;
   -- of this you must be judge.

   "I expect Mr. Rittenhouse will send you a copy of the testimony of the
   late Y. M. by this opp'y, if time will admit it to be copied -- 't is a
   poor thing.

   "Yours, &c., 
   "T. M."36
   What with this service, and his correspondence with foreign agents, Paine
   had his hands pretty full. But at the same time he wrote important letters
   to leading members of Congress, then in session at York, Pennsylvania.

   The subjoined letter sheds fresh light on a somewhat obscure point in our
   revolutionary history, -- the obscurity being due to the evasions of
   American historians on an episode of which we have little reason to be
   proud. An article of Burgoyne's capitulation (October 17th) was as
   follows: 

   "A free passage to be granted to the army under General Burgoyne to Great
   Britain, upon condition of not serving again in North America during the
   present contest: and the port of Boston to be assigned for entry of
   transports to receive the troops whenever General Howe shall so order."
   A letter was written by Paine to Hon. Richard Henry Lee, dated at: 

   "Headquarters, fourteen miles from Philadelphia,

   "October 30th, 1777.

   "I wrote you last Tuesday 21st Inst., including a Copy of the King's
   speech, since which nothing material has happened at Camp. Genl. McDougal
   was sent last Wednesday night 22d. to attack a Party of the Enemy who lay
   over the Schuylkill at Grey's Ferry where they have a Bridge. Genls.
   Greene & Sullivan went down to make a diversion below German Town at the
   same Time. I was with this last Party, but as the Enemy withdrew their
   Detachment We had only our Labor for our Pains.

   "No Particulars of the Northern Affair have yet come to head Qrs., the
   want of which has caused much Speculation. A copy, said to be the Articles
   of Capitulation was recd. 3 or 4 days ago, but they rather appear to be
   some proposals made by Burgoyne, than the Capitulation itself. By those
   Articles it appears to me that Burgoyne has capitulated upon Terms, which
   we have a right to doubt the full performance of, vizt., `That the Offrs.
   and Men shall be Transported to England and not serve in or against North
   America during the present War' -- or words to this effect.

   "I remark, that this Capitulation, if true, has the air of a National
   treaty; it is binding, not only on Burgoyne as a General, but on England
   as a Nation; because the Troops are to be subject to the conditions of the
   Treaty after they return to England and are out of his Command. It regards
   England and America as Separate Sovereign States, and puts them on an
   equal footing by staking the faith and honor of the former for the
   performance of a Contract entered into with the latter.

   "What in the Capitulation is stiled the 'Present War' England affects to
   call a `Rebellion,' and while she holds this Idea and denies any knowledge
   of America as a Separate Sovereign Power, she will not conceive herself
   bound by any Capitulation or Treaty entered into by her Generals which is
   to bind her as a Nation, and more especially in those Cases where both
   Pride and present Advantage tempt her to a Violation. She will deny
   Burgoyne's Right and Authority for making such a Treaty, and will, very
   possibly, show her insult by first censuring him for entering into it, and
   then immediately sending the Troops back.

   "I think we ought to be exceedingly cautious how we trust her with the
   power of abusing our Credulity. We have no authority for believing she
   will perform that part of the Contract which subjects her not to send the
   Troops to America during the War. The insolent Answer given to the
   Commissrs. by Ld. Stormont, 'that the King's Ambassadors recd. no Letters
   from Rebels but when they came to crave Mercy,' sufficiently instructs us
   not to entrust them with the power of insulting Treaties of Capitulation,

   "Query, Whether it wd. not be proper to detain the Troops at Boston direct
   the Commissioners at Paris to present the Treaty of Capitulation to the
   English Court thro' the hands of Ld. Stormont, to know whether it be the
   intention of that Court to abide strictly by the Conditions and
   Obligations thereof, and if no assurance be obtained to keep the Troops
   until they can be exchanged here.

   "Tho' we have no immediate knowledge of any alliance formed by our
   Commissioners with France or Spain, yet we have no assurance there is not,
   and our immediate release of those prisoners, by sending them to England,
   may operate to the injury of such Allied Powers, and be perhaps directly
   contrary to some contract subsisting between us and them prior to the
   Capitulation. I think we ought to know this first. -- Query, ought we not
   (knowing the infidelity they have already acted) to suspect they will
   evade the Treaty by putting back into New York under pretence of distress.
   -- I would not trust them an inch farther than I could see them in the
   present state of things.

   "The Army was to have marched yesterday about 2 or 3 Miles but the weather
   has been so exceedingly bad for three days past as to prevent any kind of
   movement, the waters are so much out and the rivulets so high there is no
   passing from one part of ye Camp to another.

   "I wish the Northern Army was down here. I am apt to think that nothing
   materially offensive will take place on our part at present. Some Means
   must be taken to fill up the Army this winter. I look upon the recruiting
   service at an end and that some other plan must be adopted. Suppose the
   Service be by draft -- and that those who are not drawn should contribute
   a Dollar or two Dollars a Man to him on whom the lot falls. -- something
   of this kind would proportion the Burthen, and those who are drawn would
   have something either to encourage them to go, or to provide a substitute
   with -- After closing this Letter I shall go again to Fort Mifflin; all
   was safe there on the 27th, but from some preparations of the Enemy they
   expect another attack somewhere.

   "The enclosed return of provision and Stores is taken from an account
   signed by Burgoyne and sent to Ld. George Germain. I have not time to Copy
   the whole. Burgoyne closes his Letter as follows, 'By a written account
   found in the Commissary's House at Ticonderoga Six thousand odd hundred
   Persons were fed from the Magazine the day before the evacuation.'

   "I am Dear Sir, Yr. Affectionate Hble. Servt. 

   "T. PAINE.

   "Respectful Compts. to Friends.

   "If the Congress has the Capitulation and Particulars of ye Surrender,
   they do an exceeding wrong thing by not publishing ym. because they
   subject the whole Affair to Suspicion."37
   Had this proposal of Paine, with regard to Burgoyne's capitulation, been
   followed at once, a blot on the history of our Revolution might have been
   prevented. The time required to march the prisoners to Boston and prepare
   the transports would have given England opportunity to ratify the articles
   of capitulation. Washington, with characteristic inability to see
   injustice in anything advantageous to America, desired Congress to delay
   in every possible way the return of the prisoners to England, "since the
   most virtuous adhesion to the articles would not prevent their replacing
   in garrison an equal number of soldiers who might be sent against us." The
   troops were therefore delayed on one pretext and another until Burgoyne
   declared that "the publick faith is broke." Congress seized on this remark
   to resolve that the embarkation should be suspended until an "explicit
   ratification of the Convention of Saratoga shall be properly ratified by
   the Court of Great Britain." This resolution, passed January 8, 1778, was
   not communicated to Burgoyne until February 4th. If any one should have
   suffered because of a remark made in a moment of irritation it should have
   been Burgoyne himself; but he was presently allowed to proceed to England,
   while his troops were retained, -- a confession that Burgoyne's casual
   complaint was a mere pretext for further delay. It may be added that the
   English government behaved to its surrendered soldiers worse than
   Congress. The question of ratifying the Saratoga Convention was involved
   in a partisan conflict in Parliament, the suffering prisoners in America
   were forgotten, and they were not released until the peace, -- five years
   after they had marched "with the honours of war," under a pledge of
   departure conceded by Gen. Gates in reply to a declaration that unless
   conceded they would "to a man proceed to any act of desperation sooner
   than submit."

   Concerning this ugly business there is a significant silence in Paine's
   public writings. He would not have failed to discuss the matter in
   his Crisis had he felt that anything honorable to the American name or
   cause could be made out of it.38

   In his letter to Hon. R. H. Lee (October 30, 1 777) Paine mentions that he
   is about leaving the head-quarters near Philadelphia for Fort Mifflin. Mr.
   Asa Bird Gardener, of New York, who has closely studied Paine's military
   career, writes me some account of it. 

   "Major-Gen. Greene was charged with the defence of the Delaware, and part
   of Brig.-Gen. Varnum's brigade was placed in garrison at Fort Mercer, Red
   Bank, and at Fort Mifflin, Mud Island. A bloody and unsuccessful assault
   was made by Count Donop and 1,200 Hessians on Fort Mercer, defended by the
   1st and 2d Reg'ts. R I. Continental Inf'y. The entire British fleet was
   then brought up opposite Fort Mifflin, and the most furious cannonade, and
   most desperate but finally unsuccessful defence of the place was made. The
   entire works were demolished, and most of the garrison killed and wounded.
   Major-Gen. Greene being anxious for the garrison and desirous of knowing
   its ability to resist sent Mr. Paine to ascertain. He accordingly went to
   Fort Mercer, and from thence, on Nov. 9 (1777) went with Col. Christopher
   Greene, commanding Fort Mercer, in an open boat to Fort Mifflin, during
   the cannonade, and were there when the enemy opened with two-gun batteries
   and a mortar battery. This very gallant act shows what a fearless man Mr.
   Paine was, and entitles him to the same credit for service in the
   Revolution as any Continental could claim."
   The succession of mistakes, surprises, panics, which occasioned the
   defeats before Philadelphia and ended in the occupation of that city by
   the British general, seriously affected the reputation of Washington.
   Though Paine believed that Washington's generalship had been at fault (as
   Washington himself probably did39), he could utter nothing that might
   injure the great cause. He mistrusted the singleness of purpose of
   Washington's opponents, and knew that the commander-in-chief was as
   devoted as himself to the American cause, and would never surrender it
   whatever should befall. While, therefore, the intrigues were going on at
   Yorktown, Pennsylvania, whither Congress had retreated, and Washington
   with his ill-fed and ill-clad army were suffering at Valley Forge, Paine
   was writing his fifth Crisis, which had the most happy effect. It was
   dated at Lancaster, March 21, 1778. Before that time (February 19th)
   General Gates had made his peace with Washington, and the intrigue was
   breaking up, but gloom and dissatisfaction remained. The contrast between
   the luxurious "Tories" surrounding Howe in Philadelphia, and Washington's
   wretched five thousand at Valley Forge, was demoralizing the country. The
   first part of this Crisis, addressed "to General Sir William Howe,"
   pointed wrangling patriots to the common enemy; the second, addressed "to
   the inhabitants of America," sounded a note of courage, and gave good
   reasons for it. Never was aid more artistic than that Paine's pen now gave
   Washington. The allusions to him are incidental, there is no accent of
   advocacy. While mentioning "the unabated fortitude of a Washington," he
   lays a laurel on the brow of Gates, on that of Herkimer, and even on the
   defeated. While belittling all that Howe had gained, telling him that in
   reaching Philadelphia, he "mistook a trap for a conquest," he reunites
   Washington and Gates, in the public mind, by showing the manoeuvres of the
   one near Philadelphia part of the other's victory at Saratoga. It is easy
   for modern eulogists of Washington to see this, but when Paine said it, --
   apparently aiming only to humiliate Howe, -- the sentence was a sunbeam
   parting a black cloud. Coming from a member of Greene's staff, from an
   author whose daring at Fort Mifflin had made him doubly a hero; from the
   military correspondent of the Pennsylvania Council, and the Secretary of
   the Congressional Committee of Foreign Affairs, -- Paine's optimistic view
   of the situation had immense effect. He hints his official knowledge that
   Britain's "reduced strength and exhausted coffers in a three years' war
   with America hath given a powerful superiority to France and Spain," and
   advises Americans to leave wrangling to the enemy. "We never had so small
   an army to fight against, nor so fair an opportunity of final success as
   now."

   This fifth Crisis was written mainly at Lancaster, Pa., at the house of
   William Henry, Jr., where he several times found shelter while dividing
   his time between Washington's head-quarters and York.40 Every number of
   the Crisis was thus written with full information from both the military
   and political leaders. This Crisis was finished and printed at York, and
   there Paine begins No. VI. The "stone house on the banks of the Cadorus,"
   at York, is still pointed out by a trustworthy tradition as that to which
   he bore the chest of congressional papers with which he had fled to
   Trenton, when Howe entered Philadelphia.41 It is a pleasant abode in a
   picturesque country, and no doubt Paine would have been glad to remain
   there in repose. But whoever slept on his watch during the Revolution
   Paine did not. The fifth Crisis printed, be goes to forward the Crisis he
   will publish next. In April he is again at Lancaster, and on the 11th
   writes thence to his friend Henry Laurens, President of Congress42. 

   "LANCASTER, April 11th, 17

   SIR,

   I take the liberty of mentioning an affair to you which I think deserves
   the attention of Congress. The persons who came from Philadelphia some
   time ago with, or in company with, a flag from the Enemy, and were taken
   up and committed to Lancaster jail for attempting to put off counterfeit
   Contl. money, were yesterday brought to Tryal and are likely to escape by
   means of an artful and partial Construction of an Act of this State for
   punishing such offences. The Act makes it felony to counterfeit the
   money emitted by Congress, or to circulate such counterfeits knowing them
   to be so. The offenders' Council explained the word `emitted' to have only
   a retrospect meaning by supplying the Idea of 'which have been' `emitted
   by Congress.'   Therefore say they the Act cannot be applied to any money
   emitted after the date of the Act. I believe the words `emitted by
   Congress' means only, and should be understood, to distinguish Continental
   Money from other Money, and not one Time from another Time. It has, as I
   conceive, no referrence to any Particular Time, but only to the particular
   authority which distinguishes Money so emitted from Money emitted by the
   State. It is meant only as a discription of the Money, and not of the Time
   of striking it, but includes the Idea of all Time as inseparable from the
   Continuance of the authority of Congress. But be this as it may; the
   offence is Continental and the consequences of the same extent. I can have
   no Idea of any particular State pardoning an offence against all, or even
   their letting an offender slip legally who is accountable to all and every
   State alike for his crime. The place where he commits it is the least
   circumstance of it. It is a mere accident and has nothing or very little
   to do with the crime itself. I write this hoping the Information will
   point out the necessity of the Congress supporting their emissions by
   claiming every offender in this line where the present deficiency of the
   Law or the Partial Interpretation of it operates to the Injustice and
   Injury of the whole Continent.

   "I beg leave to trouble you with another hint. Congress I learn has
   something to propose thro' the Commissrs. on the Cartel respecting the
   admission and stability of the Continental Currency. As Forgery is a Sin
   against all men alike, and reprobated by all civil nations, Query, would
   it not be right to require of General Howe the Persons of Smithers and
   others in Philadelphia suspected of this crime; and if He, or any other
   Commander, continues to conceal or protect them in such practices, that,
   in such case, the Congress will consider the crime as the Act of the
   Commander-in-Chief. Howe affects not to know the Congress -- he ought to
   be made to know them ; and the apprehension of Personal Consequences may
   have some effect on his Conduct.

   I am, Dear Sir, Your obt. and humble Servt.,

   "T. PAINE.

   "Since writing the foregoing the Prisoners have had their Tryal, the one
   is acquitted and the other convicted only of a Fraud; for as the law now
   stands, or rather as it is explained, the counterfeiting -- or circulating
   counterfeits -- is only a fraud. I do not believe it was the intention of
   the Act to make it so, and I think it misapplied Lenity in the Court to
   suffer such an Explanation, because it has a tendency to invite and
   encourage a Species of Treason, the most prejudicial to us of any or all
   the other kinds. I am aware how very difficult it is to make a law so very
   perfect at first as not to be subject to false or perplexed conclusions.
   There never was but one Act (said a Member of the House of Commons) which
   a man might not creep out of, i.e. the Act which obliges a man to be
   buried in woollen.

   T. P."
   The active author and secretary had remained in Philadelphia two days
   after Howe had crossed the Schuylkill, namely, until September 21st. The
   events of that time, and of the winter, are related in a letter to
   Franklin, in Paris, which is of too much historical importance for any
   part of it to be omitted. It is dated Yorktown, May 16, 1778.

   "Your favor of Oct. 7th did not come to me till March. I was at Camp when
   Capt. Folger, arrived with the Blank Packet. The private Letters were, I
   believe, all safe. Mr. Laurens for. warded yours to York Town where I
   afterwards recd. it.

   "The last winter has been rather barren of military events, but for your
   amusement I send you a little history how I have passed away part of the
   time.

   "The 11th of Sepr. last I was preparing Dispatches for you when the report
   of cannon at Brandywine interrupted my proceeding. The event of that day
   you have doubtless been informed of, which, excepting the Enemy keeping
   the ground, may be deemed a drawn battle. Genl. Washington collected his
   Army at Chester, and the Enemy's not moving towards him next day must be
   attributed to the disability they sustained and the burthen of their
   wounded. On the 16th of the same month, the two Armies were drawn up in
   order of battle near the White Horse on the Lancaster road, when a most
   violent and incessant storm of rain prevented an action. Our Army
   sustained a heavy loss in their Ammunition, the Cartouch Boxes, especially
   as they were not of the most seasoned leather, being no proof agst. the
   almost incredible fury of the weather, which obliged Genl. Washn. to draw
   his Army up into the country till those injuries could be repaired, and a
   new supply of ammunition procured. The Enemy in the mean time kept on the
   West Side of Schuylkill. On Fryday the 19th about one in the morning the
   first alarm of their crossing was given, and the confusion, as you may
   suppose, was very great. It was a beautiful still moonlight morning and
   the streets as full of men women and children as on a market day. On the
   eveng, before I was fully persuaded that unless something was done the
   City would be lost; and under that anxiety I went to Col. Bayard, speaker
   of the house of Assembly, and represented, as I very particularly knew it,
   the situation we were in, and the probability of saving the City if proper
   efforts were made for that purpose. I reasoned thus -- Genl. Washn. was
   about 30 Miles up the Schuylkill with an Army properly collected waiting
   for Ammunition, besides which, a reinforcement of 1500 men were marching
   from the North River to join him; and if only an appearance of defence be
   made in the City by throwing up works at the heads of streets, it will
   make the Enemy very suspicious how they throw themselves between the City
   and Genl. Washington, and between two Rivers, which must have been the
   case; for notwithstanding the knowledge which military gentlemen are
   supposed to have, I observe they move exceedingly cautiously on new
   ground, are exceedingly suspicious of Villages and Towns, and more
   perplexed at seemingly little things which they cannot clearly understand
   than at great ones which they are fully acquainted with. And I think it
   very probable that Genl. Howe would have mistaken our necessity for a deep
   laid scheme and not have ventured himself in the middle of it. But
   admitting that he had, he must either have brought his whole Army down, or
   a part of it. If the whole, Gen. W. would have followed him, perhaps the
   same day, in two or three days at most, and our assistance in the City
   would have been material. If only a part of it, we should have been a
   match for them, and Gen. W. superior to those which remained above. The
   chief thing was, whether the cityzens would turn out to defend the City.
   My proposal to Cols. Bayard and Bradford was to call them together the
   next morning, make them fully acquainted with the situation and the means
   and prospect of preserving themselves, and that the City had better
   voluntarily assess itself 50,000 for its defence than suffer an Enemy to
   come into it. Cols. Bayard and Bradford were in my opinion, and as Genl.
   Mifflin was then in town, I next went to him, acquainted him with our
   design, and mentioned likewise that if two or three thousand men could be
   mustered up whether we might depend on him to command them, for without
   some one to lead, nothing could be done. He declined that part, not being
   then very well, but promised what assistance he could. -- A few hours
   after this the alarm happened. I went directly to Genl. Mifflin but he had
   set off, and nothing was done. I cannot help being of opinion that the
   City might have been saved, but perhaps it is better otherwise.

   "I staid in the City till Sunday [Sep. 21st], having sent my Chest and
   everything belonging to the foreign Committee to Trenton in a Shallop. The
   Enemy did not cross the river till the Wednesday following. Hearing on the
   Sunday that Genl. Washn. had moved to Swederford I set off for that place
   but learning on the road that it was a mistake and that he was six or
   seven miles above that place, I crossed over to Southfield and the next
   Morning to Trenton, to see after my Chest. On the Wednesday Morning I
   intended returning to Philadelphia, but was informed at Bristol of the
   Enemy's crossing the Schuylkill. . At this place I met Col. Kirkbride of
   Pennsburg Manor, who invited me home with him. On Fryday the 26th a Party
   of the Enemy about 1500 took possession of the City, and the same day an
   account arrived that Col. Brown had taken 300 of the Enemy at the old
   french lines at Ticonderoga and destroyed all their Water Craft, being
   about 200 boats of different kinds.

   "On the 29th Sept. I set off for Camp without well knowing where to find
   it, every day occasioning some movement. I kept pretty high up the
   country, and being unwilling to ask questions, not knowing what company I
   might be in, I was three days before I fell in with it. The Army had moved
   about three miles lower down that morning. The next day they made a
   movement about the same distance, to the 21 Mile Stone on the Skippach
   Road-Head Quarters at John Wince's. On the 3d Octr. in the morning they
   began to fortify the Camp, as a deception; and about 9 at Night marched
   for German Town. The Number of Continental Troops was between 8 and 9000,
   besides Militia, the rest remaining as Guards for the security of Camp.
   Genl. Greene, whose Quarters I was at, desired me to remain there till
   Morning. I set off for German Town about 5 next morning. The Skirmishing
   with the Pickets began soon after. I met no person for several miles
   riding, which I concluded to be a good sign; after this I met a man on
   horseback who told me he was going to hasten on a supply of ammunition,
   that the Enemy were broken and retreating fast, which was true. I saw
   several country people with arms in their hands running cross a field
   towards German Town, within about five or six miles, at which I met
   several of the wounded on waggons, horseback, and on foot. I passed Genl.
   Nash on a litter made of poles, but did not know him. I felt unwilling to
   ask questions lest the information should not be agreeable, and kept on.
   About two miles after this I passed a promiscuous crowd of wounded and
   otherwise who were halted at a house to refresh. Col. Biddle D.Q.N.G. was
   among them, who called after me, that if I went farther on that road I
   should be taken, for that the firing which I heard ahead was the Enemy's.
   I never could, and cannot now learn, and I believe no man can inform truly
   the cause of that day's miscarriage.

   "The retreat was as extraordinary. Nobody hurried themselves. Every one
   marched his own pace. The Enemy kept a civil distance behind, sending
   every now and then a Shot after us, and receiving the same from us. That
   part of the Army which I was with collected and formed on the Hill on the
   side of the road near White Marsh Church; the Enemy came within three
   quarters of a mile and halted. The orders on Retreat were to assemble that
   night on the back of Perkiominy Creek, about 7 miles above Camp, which had
   orders to move. The Army had marched the preceding night 14 miles and
   having full 20 to march back were exceedingly fatigued. They appeared to
   me to be only sensible of a disappointment, not a defeat, and to be more
   displeased at their retreating from German Town, than anxious to get to
   their rendezvous. I was so lucky that night to get to a little house about
   4 miles wide of Perkiominy, towards which place in the morning I heard a
   considerable firing, which distressed me exceedingly, knowing that our
   army was much harassed and not collected. However, I soon relieved myself
   by going to see. They were discharging their pieces, wch. tho' necessary,
   prevented several Parties going till next day. I breakfasted next morning
   at Genl. W. Quarters, who was at the same loss with every other to account
   for the accidents of the day. I remember his expressing his Surprise, by
   saying, that at the time he supposed every thing secure, and was about
   giving orders for the Army to proceed down to Philadelphia; that he most
   unexpectedly saw a Part (I think of the Artillery) hastily retreating.
   This partial Retreat was, I believe, misunderstood, and soon followed by
   others. The fog was frequently very thick, the Troops young and unused to
   breaking and rallying, and our men rendered suspicious to each other, many
   of them being in Red. A new Army once disordered is difficult to manage,
   the attempt dangerous. To this may be added a prudence in not putting
   matters to too hazardous a tryal the first time. Men must be taught
   regular fighting by practice and degrees, and tho' the expedition failed,
   it had this good effect -- that they seemed to feel themselves more
   important after it than before, as it was the first general attack they
   had ever made.

   "I have not related the affair at Mr. Chew's house German Town, as I was
   not there, but have seen it since. It certainly afforded the Enemy time to
   rally -- yet the matter was difficult. To have pressed on and left 500 Men
   in ye rear, might by a change of circumstances been ruinous. To attack
   them was loss of time, as the house is a strong stone building, proof
   against any 12 pounder. Genl. Washington sent a flag, thinking it would
   procure their surrender and expedite his march to Philadelphia; it was
   refused, and circumstances changed almost directly after.

   "I staid in Camp two days after the Germantown action, and lest any ill
   impression should get among the Garrisons at Mud Island and Red Bank, and
   the Vessels and Gallies stationed there, I crossed over to the Jersies at
   Trenton and went down to those places. I laid the first night on board the
   Champion Continental Galley, who was stationed off the mouth of
   Schuylkill. The Enemy threw up a two Gun Battery on the point of the
   river's mouth opposite the Pest House. The next morning was a thick fog,
   and as soon as it cleared away, and we became visible to each other, they
   opened on the Galley, who returned the fire. The Commodore made a signal
   to bring the Galley under the Jersey shore, as she was not a match for the
   Battery, nor the Battery a sufficient Object for the Galley. One Shot went
   thro' the fore sail, wch. was all. At noon I went with Col. [Christopher]
   Greene, who commanded at Red Bank, over to fort Mifflin (Mud Island). The
   Enemy opened that day 2 two-gun Batteries, and a Mortar Battery, on the
   fort. They threw about 30 Shells into it that afternoon, without doing any
   damage; the ground being damp and spongy, not above five or six burst; not
   a man was killed or wounded. I came away in the evening, laid on board the
   Galley, and the next day came to Col. Kirkbride's [Bordentown N. J.] ;
   staid a few days, and came again to Camp. An Expedition was on foot the
   evening I got there in which I went as Aid-de-Camp to Genl. Greene, having
   a Volunteer Commission for that purpose. The Occasion was -- a Party of
   the Enemy, about 1500, lay over the Schuylkill at Grey's ferry. Genl.
   McDougall with his Division was sent to attack them; and Sullivan & Greene
   with their Divisions were to favor the enterprise by a feint on the City,
   down the German Town road. They set off about nine at night, and halted at
   day break, between German Town and the City, the advanced Party at the
   three Miles Run. As I knew the ground I went with two light horse to
   discover the Enemy's Picket, but the dress of the light horse being white
   made them, I thought, too visible, as it was then twilight; on which I
   left them with my horse, and went on foot, till I distinctly saw the
   Picket at Mr. Dickerson's place, -- which is the nearest I have been to
   Philadelphia since Sepr., except once at Coopers ferry, as I went to the
   forts. Genl. Sullivan was at Dr. Redman's house, and McDougall's beginning
   the attack was to be the Signal for moving down to the City. But the Enemy
   either on the approach of McDougall, or on information of it, called in
   their Party, and the Expedition was frustrated.

   "A Cannonade, by far the most furious I ever heard, began down the river,
   soon after daylight, the first Gun of which we supposed to be the Signal;
   but was soon undeceived, there being no small Arms. After waiting two
   hours beyond the time, we marched back, the cannon was then less frequent;
   but on the road between German Town and White marsh we were stuned with a
   report as loud as a peal from a hundred Cannon at once; and turning round
   I saw a thick smoke rising like a pillar, and spreading from the top like
   a tree. This was the blowing up of the Augusta. I did not hear the
   explosion of the Berlin.

   "After this I returned to Col. Kirkbride's where I staid about a
   fortnight, and set off again to Camp. The day after I got there Genls.
   Greene, Wayne, and Cadwallader, with a Party of light horse, were ordered
   on a reconnoitering Party towards the forts. We were out four days and
   nights without meeting with any thing material. An East Indiaman, whom the
   Enemy had cut down so as to draw but little water, came up, without guns,
   while we were on foot on Carpenter's Island, going to Province Island. Her
   Guns were brought up in the evening in a flat, she got in the rear of the
   Fort, where few or no Guns could bear upon her, and the next morning,
   played on it incessantly. The night following the fort was evacuated. The
   obstruction the Enemy met with from those forts, and the Chevaux de
   frise was extraordinary, and had it not been that the Western Channel,
   deepened by the current, being somewhat obstructed by the Chevaux de
   frise in the main river, which enabled them to bring up the
   light Indiaman Battery, it is a doubt whether they would have succeeded at
   last. By that assistance they reduced the fort, and got sufficient command
   of the river to move some of the late sunk Chevaux de frise. Soon after
   this the fort on Red Bank, (which had bravely repulsed the Enemy a little
   time before) was evacuated, the Gallies ordered up to Bristol, and the
   Capts. of such other armed Vessels as thought they could not pass on the
   Eastward side of Windmill Island, very precipitately set them on fire. As
   I judged from this event that the Enemy would winter in Philadelphia, I
   began to think of preparing for York Town, which however I was willing to
   delay, hoping that the ice would afford opportunity for new Manoeuvres.
   But the season passed very barrenly away. I staid at Col. Kirkbride's till
   the latter end of Janay. Commodore Haslewood, who commanded the remains of
   the fleet at Trenton, acquainted me with a scheme of his for burning the
   Enemy's Shipping, which was by sending a charged boat across the river
   from Cooper's ferry, by means of a Rocket fixt in its stern. Considering
   the width of the river, the tide, and the variety of accidents that might
   change its direction, I thought the project trifling and insufficient; and
   proposed to him, that if he would get a boat properly choyed, and take a
   Batteau in tow, sufficient to bring three or four persons off, that I
   would make one with him and two other persons who might be relied on to go
   down on that business. One of the Company, Capn. Blewer of Philadelphia,
   seconded the proposal, but the Commodore, and, what I was more surprized
   at, Col. Bradford, declined it. The burning of part of the Delaware fleet,
   the precipitate retreat of the rest, the little service rendered by them
   and the great expence they were at, make the only national blot in the
   proceedings of the last Campaign. I felt a strong anxiety for them to
   recover their credit, wch., among others, was one motive for my proposal.
   After this I came to camp, and from thence to York Town, and published
   the Crisis No. 5,To Genl. Howe. I have began No. 6, which I intend to
   address to Ld. North.

   "I was not at Camp when Genl. Howe marched out on the 20th of Decr.
   towards White marsh. It was a most contemptible affair, the threatenings
   and seeming fury he sate out with, and haste and Terror the Army retreated
   with, make it laughable. I have seen several persons from Philadelphia who
   assure me that their coming back was a mere uproar, and plainly indicated
   their apprehensions of a pursuit. Genl. Howe, in his Letter to Ld. Go.
   Germain, dated Dec. 13th, represented Genl. Washington's Camp as a
   strongly fortified place. There was not, Sir, a work thrown up in it till
   Genl. Howe marched out, and then only here and there a breast work. It was
   a temporary Station. Besides which, our men begin to think Works in the
   field of little use.

   "Genl. Washington keeps his Station at the Valley forge. I was there when
   the Army first began to build huts; they appeared to me like a family of
   Beavers; every one busy; some carrying Logs, others Mud, and the rest
   fastening them together. The whole was raised in a few days, and is a
   curious collection of buildings in the true rustic order.

   "As to Politics, I think we are now safely landed. The apprehension which
   Britain must be under from her neighbours must effectually prevent her
   sending reinforcements, could she procure them. She dare not, I think, in
   the present situation of affairs trust her troops so far from home.

   "No Commissrs. are yet arrived. I think fighting is nearly over, for
   Britain, mad, wicked, and foolish, has done her utmost. The only part for
   her now to act is frugality, and the only way for her to get out of debt
   is to lessen her Government expenses. Two Millions a year is a sufficient
   allowance, and as much as she ought to expend exclusive of the interest of
   her Debt. The Affairs of England are approaching either to ruin or
   redemption. If the latter, she may bless the resistance of America.

   "For my own part, I thought it very hard to have the Country set on fire
   about my Ears almost the moment I got into it; and among other pleasures I
   feel in having uniformly done my duty, I feel that of not having
   discredited your friendship and patronage.

   "I live in hopes of seeing and advising with you respecting the History of
   the American Revolution, as soon as a turn of Affairs make it safe for me
   to take a passage to Europe. Please to accept my thanks for the Pamphlets,
   which Mr. Temple Franklin informs me he has sent. They are not yet come to
   hand. Mr. & Mrs. Bache are at Mainheim, near Lancaster; I heard they were
   well a few days ago. I laid two nights at Mr. Duffield's, in the winter.
   Miss Nancy Clifton was there, who said the Enemy had destroyed or sold a
   great quantity of your furniture. Mr. Duffield has since been taken by
   them and carried into the City, but is now at his own house. I just now
   hear they have burnt Col. Kirkbride's, Mr. Borden's, and some other houses
   at Borden Town. Governor Johnstone (House of Commons) has wrote to Mr.
   Robt. Morriss informing him of Commissioners coming from England. The
   letter is printed in the Newspapers without signature, and is dated Febry.
   5th, by which you will know it43.

   "Please, Sir, to accept this, rough and incorrect as it is, as I have
   [not] time to copy it fair, which was my design when I began it; besides
   which, paper is most exceedingly scarce.

   "I am, Dear Sir, your Obliged and Affectionate humble Servt., 

   "T. PAINE.

   "The Honble. BEND. FRANKLIN, Esqr."
   Paine's prophecy at the close of his fifth Crisis (March, 1778), that
   England, reduced by her war with America, was in peril from France, was
   speedily confirmed. The treaty between France and America (February 6th)
   was followed by a war-cloud in Europe, which made the Americans sanguine
   that their own struggle was approaching an end. It was generally expected
   that Philadelphia would be evacuated. On this subject Paine wrote the
   following letter to Washington: 

   "York Town, June 5th, 1778.

   Sir,

   As a general opinion prevails that the Enemy will quit Philadelphia, I
   take the Liberty of transmitting you my reasons why it is probable they
   will not. In your difficult and distinguished Situation every hint may be
   useful.

   "I put the immediate cause of their evacuation, to be a declaration of War
   in Europe made by them or against them: in which case, their Army would be
   wanted for other Service, and likewise because their present situation
   would be too unsafe, being subject to be blocked up by France and attacked
   by you and her jointly.

   "Britain will avoid a War with France if she can; which according to my
   arrangement of Politics she may easily do -- She must see the necessity of
   acknowledging, sometime or other, the Independance of America; if she is
   wise enough to make that acknowledgment now, she of consequence admits the
   Right of France to the quiet enjoyment of her Treaty, and therefore no War
   can take place upon the Ground of having concluded a Treaty with revolted
   British Subjects.

   "This being admitted, their apprehension of being doubly attacked, or of
   being wanted elsewhere, cease of consequence; and they will then endeavor
   to hold all they can, that they may have something to restore, in lieu of
   something else which they will demand; as I know of no Instance where
   conquered Plans were surrendered up prior to, but only in consequence of a
   Treaty of Peace.

   "You will observe, Sir, that my reasoning is founded on the supposition of
   their being reasonable Beings, which if they are not, then they are not
   within the compass of my System. I am, Sir, with every wish for your
   happiness,

   Your Affectionate and Obt. humble Servant, 
   "THOS. PAINE.

   His Excellency, GENL. WASHINGTON, Valley Forge."

   Shortly after this letter to Washington tidings came that a French fleet,
   under Count d'Estaing, had appeared on the coast, and was about to
   blockade the Delaware. The British apparently in panic, really by order
   from England, left Philadelphia, June 18th. This seeming flight was a
   great encouragement. Congress was soon comfortably seated in Philadelphia,
   where Paine had the pleasure of addressing his next Crisis to the British
   Peace Commissioners.

   In Philadelphia Congress was still surrounded by a hostile population;
   Paine had still to plead that there should be no peace without republican
   independence. Even so late as November 24, 1778, the French Minister
   (Gerard) writes to his government: "Scarcely one quarter of the ordinary
   inhabitants of Philadelphia now here favour the cause (of independence).
   Commercial and family ties, together with an aversion to popular
   government, seem to account for this. The same feeling exists in New York
   and Boston, which is not the case in the rural districts." While Franklin
   was offered in Paris the bribe of a peerage, and the like for several
   revolutionary leaders, similar efforts were made in America to subdue the
   "rebellion" by craft. For that purpose had come the Earl of Carlisle, Sir
   George Johnstone, and William Eden. Johnstone had retired from the
   Commission in disgust. Referring to the invitation of the Peace
   Commissioners, that America should join them against France, he says
   "Unless you were capable of such conduct yourselves, you would never have
   supposed such a character in us." He reminds the commissioners, who had
   threatened that America must be laid waste so as to be useless to France,
   that increased wants of America must make her a more valuable purchaser in
   France. Paine mentions Sir H. Clinton with some significance, and suspects
   the truth that he had brought orders, received from England, overruling an
   intention of the peace envoys to burn Philadelphia if their terms were
   rejected. He says he has written a Crisis for the English people because
   there was a convenient conveyance; "for the Commissioners -- poor
   Commissioners! -- having proclaimed that `yet forty days and Nineveh shall
   be overthrown,' have waited out the date, and, discontented with their
   God, are returning to their gourd. And all the harm I wish them is that it
   may not wither about their ears, and that they may not make their exit in
   the belly of a whale."

                                  CHAPTER  IX

                  FRENCH AID, AND THE PAINE-DEANS CONTROVERSY 
                                  [1778-1779]

   IN Bell's addenda to "Common Sense," which contained Paine's Address to
   the Quakers (also letters by others), appeared a little poem which I
   believe his, and the expression of his creed. 
    

   "THE AMERICAN PATRIOT'S PRAYER"

   "Parent of all, omnipotent 
       In heaven, and earth below, 
    Through all creation's bounds unspent, 
       Whose streams of goodness flow,

   "Teach me to know from whence I rose, 
       And unto what designed; 
    No private aims let me propose, 
       Since link'd with human kind.

   "But chief to hear my country's voice, 
       May all my thoughts incline; 
    'T is reason's law, 't is virtue's choice, 
       'T is nature's call and thine.

   "Me from fair freedom's sacred cause 
       Let nothing e'er divide; 
    Grandeur, nor gold, nor vain applause, 
       Nor friendship false misguide.

   "Let me not faction's partial hate 
       Pursue to this Land's woe; 
    Nor grasp the thunder of the state 
       To wound a private foe.

   "If, for the right to wish the wrong 
       My country shall combine, 
    Single to serve th' erroneous throng, 
       Spight of themselves, be mine."
   Every sacrifice contemplated in this self-dedication had to be made. Paine
   had held back nothing from the cause. He gave America the copyrights of
   his eighteen pamphlets. While they were selling by thousands, at two or
   three shillings each, he had to apologize to a friend for not sending his
   boots, on the ground that he must borrow the money to pay for them! He had
   given up the magazine so suited to his literary and scientific tastes, had
   dismissed his lucrative school in Philadelphia, taken a musket on his
   Quaker shoulders, shared the privations of the retreat to the Delaware,
   braved bullets at Trenton and bombs at Fort Mifflin. But now he was to
   give up more. He was:

   "Single to serve th' erroneous throng, 
    Spight of themselves,"
   and thereby lose applause and friendship. An ex-Congressman, sent to
   procure aid in France, having, as Paine believed, attempted a fraud on the
   scanty funds of this country, he published his reasons for so believing.
   In doing so he alarmed the French Ambassador in America, and incurred the
   hostility of a large party in Congress; the result being his resignation
   of the secretaryship of its Foreign Affairs Committee.

   It has been traditionally asserted that, in this controversy, Paine
   violated his oath of office. Such is not the fact. His official oath,
   which was prepared for Paine himself -- the first secretary of a new
   committee, -- was framed so as to leave him large freedom as a public
   writer. 

   "That the said secretary, previous to his entering on his office, take an
   oath, to be administered by the president, well and faithfully to execute
   the trust reposed in him, according to his best skill and judgment; and to
   disclose no matter, the knowledge of which shall be acquired in
   consequence of his office, that he shall be directed to keep secret."
   Not only was there no such direction of secrecy in this case, but Congress
   did not know the facts revealed by Paine. Compelled by a complaint of the
   French Minister to disown Paine's publication, Congress refused to vote
   that it was "an abuse of office," or to discharge him. The facts should be
   judged on their merits, and without prejudice. I have searched and sifted
   many manuscripts in European and American archives to get at the truth of
   this strange chapter in our revolutionary history, concerning which there
   is even yet an unsettled controversy44. The reader who desires to explore
   the subject will find an ample literature concerning it, but with
   confusing omissions, partly due to a neglect of Paine's papers.

   The suggestion of French aid to America was first made in May, 1775, by
   Dubourg, and a scheme was submitted by Beaumarchais to the King. This was
   first brought to light in November, 1878, in the Magazine of American
   History, where it is said: "It is without date, but must have been written
   after the arrival of the American Commissioners in Paris." This is an
   error. A letter of December 7, 1775, from Beaumarchais proves that the
   undated one had been answered. Moreover, on June 10, 1776, a month before
   Deane had reached Paris, and six months before Franklin's arrival, the
   million for America had been paid to Beaumarchais and receipted. It was
   Deane's ruin that he appeared as if taking credit for, and bringing within
   the scope of his negotiations, money paid before his arrival. It was the
   ruin of Beaumarchais that he deceived Deane about that million.

   In 1763 France had suffered by her struggle with England humiliations and
   territorial losses far heavier than those suffered by her last war with
   Germany. With the revolt of the English colonies in America the hour of
   French revenge struck. Louis XVI. did not care much about it, but his
   minister Vergennes did. Inspired by him, Beaumarchais, adventurer and
   playwright, consulted Arthur Lee, secret agent of Congress in London, and
   it was arranged that Beaumarchais should write a series of letters to the
   King, to be previously revised by Vergennes. The letters are such as
   letters to the King, to be previously revised by Vergennes. The letters
   are such as might be expected from the pen that wrote "The Marriage of
   Figaro." He paints before the King the scene of France driven out of
   America and India; he describes America as advancing to engage the
   conqueror of France with a force which a little help would make sufficient
   to render England helpless beside her European foes -- France and Spain.
   Learning through Vergennes that the King was mindful of his treaty with
   England, Beaumarchais made a proposal that the aid should be rendered as
   if by, a commercial house, without knowledge of the government. This, the
   most important document of the case, suppressed, until: 1878, was unknown
   to any of the writers who have discussed this question, except Durand and
   Stille, the latter alone having recognized its bearing on the question of
   Beaumarchais' good faith. Beaumarchais tells the King that his "succor" is
   not to end the war in America, but "to continue and feed it to the great
   damage of the English"; that "to, sacrifice a million to put England to
   the expense of a hundred millions, is exactly the same as if you advance a
   million to gain ninety-nine." Half of the million (livres) is to be sent
   to America, in gold, and half in powder. So far from this aid being,
   gratuitous, the powder is to be taken from French magazines at "four to
   six sols per pound," and: sent to America "on the basis of twenty sols per
   pound." 
    

   "The constant view of the affair in which the mass of Congress ought to be
   kept is the certainly that your Majesty is not willing to enter in any way
   into the affair, but that a. company is vet generously about to turn over
   a certain sum to the prudent management of a faithful agent to give
   successive aid to the Americans by the shortest and the surest means of
   return in tobacco."
   How much of this scheme actually reached the King, and was approved by
   him, is doubtful. He still hesitated, and another appeal was made
   (February 29,1776) embodying one from Arthur Lee, who says: "We offer to
   France, in return for her secret assistance, a secret treaty of commerce,
   by which she will secure for a certain number of years after peace is
   declared all the advantages with which we have enriched England for the
   past century, with, additionally, a guarantee of her possessions according
   to our forces." Nothing is said by Arthur Lee about other payments. The
   Queen had now become interested in the gallant Americans, and the King was
   brought over to the scheme in April. On May 2, 1776, Vergennes submits to
   the King the order for a million livres which he is to sign; also a
   letter, to be written by the hand of the Minister's son, aged fifteen, to
   Beaumarchais, who, he says, will employ M. Montandoin (the name was really
   Montieu) to transmit to the Americans "such funds as your Majesty chooses
   to appropriate for their benefit." There are various indications that the
   pecuniary advantages, in the way of "sols" and tobacco, were not set
   before the King, and that he yielded to considerations of state policy.

   After receiving the million (June 10th) Beaumarchais wrote to Arthur Lee
   in London (June 12, 1776): "The difficulties I have found in my
   negotiations with the Minister have determined me to form a company which
   will enable the munitions and powder to be transmitted sooner to your
   friend on condition of his returning tobacco to Cape Francis."

   To Arthur Lee, whom he had met at the table of Lord Mayor John Wilkes,
   Beaumarchais had emphasized the "generous" side of his scheme. Tobacco was
   indeed to be sent, chiefly to give a commercial color to the transaction
   for the King's concealment, but there appeared no reason to do more with
   Lee, who had no power of contract, than impress him with the magnanimity
   and friendship of the French government. This Lee was to report to the
   Secret Committee of Congress, which would thus be prepared to agree to any
   arrangement of Beaumarchais' agent, without any suspicion that it might be
   called on to pay twenty sols a pound for powder that had cost from four to
   six. Lee did report it, sending a special messenger (Story) to announce to
   Congress the glad tidings of French aid, and much too gushingly its
   quasi-gratuitous character.

   A month later Silas Deane, belated since March 5th by wind and wave,
   reached Paris, and about July 17, 1776, by advice of Vergennes, had his
   first interview with Beaumarchais. Had Beaumarchais known that an agent,
   empowered by Congress to purchase munitions, was on his way to France, he
   would have had nothing to do with Lee; now he could only repudiate him,
   and persuade Deane to disregard him. Arthur Lee informed Deane that
   Beaumarchais had told him that he had received two hundred thousand pounds
   sterling of the French administration for the use of Congress, but Deane
   believed Beaumarchais, who "constantly and positively denied having said
   any such thing." It had been better for Deane if he had believed Lee45. It
   turned out in the end that Beaumarchais had received the sum Lee named,
   and the French government -- more anxious for treaty concessions from
   America than for Beaumarchais' pocket assured the American Commissioners
   that the million was a royal gift.

   This claim to generosity, however, or rather the source of it, was a
   secret of the negotiation. In October, 1777, the commissioners wrote to
   Congress a letter which, being intercepted, reached that body only in
   duplicate, March, 1778, saying they had received assurances "that no
   repayment will ever be required from us for what has already been given us
   either in money or military stores." One of these commissioners was Silas
   Deane himself (the others Franklin and Lee). But meanwhile Beaumarchais
   had claimed of Congress, by an agent (De Francy) sent to America, payment
   of his bill, which included the million which his government declared had
   been a gift. This complication caused Congress to recall Deane for
   explanations.

   Deane arrived in America in July, 1778. There were suspicious
   circumstances around him. He had left his papers in Paris; he had borrowed
   money of Beaumarchais for personal expenses, and the despatch he had
   signed in October, saying the million was a gift, had been intercepted,
   other papers in the same package having duly arrived. Thus appearances
   were against Deane. The following statement, in Paine's handwriting, was
   no doubt prepared for submission to Congress, and probably was read during
   one of its secret discussions of the matter. It is headed "Explanatory
   Circumstances."

   "1st. The lost dispatches are dated Oct. 6th and Oct. 7th. They were sent
   by a private hand -- that is, they were not sent by the post. Capt. Folger
   had the charge of them. They were all under one cover containing five
   separate Packets; three of the Packets were on commercial matters only --
   one of these was to Mr. R[obert] Morris, Chairman of the Commercial
   Committee, one to Mr. Hancock (private concerns), another to Barnaby
   Deane, S. Deane's brother. Of the other two Packets, one of them was to
   the Secret Committee, then stiled the Committee for Foreign Affairs, the
   other was to Richard H. Lee -- these two last Packets had nothing in them
   but blank white French Paper.

   "2d,   In Sept'r preceding the date of the dispatches Mr. B[eaumarchais]
   sent Mr. Francis [De Francy] to Congress to press payment to the amount
   mentioned in the official Letter of Oct. 6. Mr. F[rancy] brought a letter
   signed only by S. Deane -- the Capt. of the vessel (Landais) brought
   another letter from Deane; both of these letters were to enforce Mr.
   B[eaumarchais'] demand. Mr. F[rancy] arrived with his letters and demand.
   The official despatches (if I may so say) arrived blank. Congress
   therefore had no authoritative information to act by. About this time Mr.
   D[eane] was recalled and arrived in America in Count D'Estaing's fleet. He
   gave out that he had left his accounts in France.

   "With the Treaty of Alliance come over the Duplicates of the lost
   Despatches. They come into my office not having been seen by Congress; and
   as they contain an injunction not to be conceded by [to ?] Congress, I
   kept them secret in the office because at that time the foreign Committee
   were dispersed and new members not appointed:

   "On the 5th of Dec. 1778, Mr. D[eane] published an inflamatory piece
   against Congress. As I saw it had an exceeding ill effect out of doors I
   made some remarks upon it -- with a view of preventing people running mad.
   This piece was replied to by a piece under the Signature of Plain Truth --
   in which it was stated, that Mr. D[eane] though a stranger in France and
   to the Language, and without money, had by himself procured 30,000 stand
   of Arms, 30,000 suits of Cloathing, and more than 200 pieces of Brass
   Cannon. I replied that these supplies were in a train of Execution before
   he was sent to France. That Mr. Deane's private letters and his official
   despatches jointly with the other two Commissioners contradicted each
   other.

   "At this time I found Deane had made a large party in Congress -- and that
   a motion had been made but not decided upon for dismissing me from the
   foreign office, with a kind of censure."
   Deane was heard by Congress twice (August 9 and 21, 1778) but made a bad
   impression, and a third hearing was refused. In wrath he appealed in the
   press "to the free and virtuous Citizens of America," (December 5, 1778)
   against the injustice of Congress. This Paine answered in the Pennsylvania
   Packet of December 15, 1778. His motives are told in the following letter
   addressed to the Hon. Henry Laurens: 

   "PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 15th, 1778.

   "DEAR SIR.

   "In this morning's paper is a piece addressed to Mr. Deane, in which your
   name is mentioned. My intention in relating the circumstances with wch. it
   is connected is to prevent the Enemy drawing any unjust conclusions from
   an accidental division in the House on matters no ways political. You will
   please to observe that I have been exceedingly careful to preserve the
   honor of Congress in the minds of the people who have been so exceedingly
   fretted by Mr. Deane's address -- and this will appear the more necessary
   when I inform you that a proposal has been made for calling a Town Meeting
   to demand justice for Mr. Deane. I have been applied to smoothly and
   roughly not to publish this piece. Mr. Deane has likewise been with the
   Printer. I am, &c."
   To Paine, who had given his all to the American cause, nothing could
   appear more natural than that France and her King should do the same with
   pure disinterestedness. Here were Lafayette and other Frenchmen at
   Washington's side. However, the one thing he was certain of was that Deane
   had no claim to be credited with the French subsidies. Had Henry Laurens
   been President of Congress it would have been easy to act on that body
   through him; but he had resigned, and the new president, John Jay, was a
   prominent member of the Deane party. So Paine resolved to defeat what he
   considered a fraud on the country at whatever cost. In the course of the
   controversy he wrote (January 2, 1779):

   "If Mr. Deane or any other gentleman will procure an order from Congress
   to inspect an account in my office, or any of Mr. Deane's friends in
   Congress will take the trouble of coming themselves, I will give him or
   them my attendance, and shew them in handwriting which Mr. Deane is well
   acquainted with, that the supplies he so pompously plumes himself upon
   were promised and engaged, and that as a present, before he ever arrived
   in France; and the part that fell to Mr. Deane was only to see it done,
   and how he has performed that service the public are acquainted with."
   Although Paine here gave the purport of the commissioners' letter, showing
   plainly that Deane had nothing to do with obtaining the supplies, he is
   not so certain that they were gratuitous, and adds, in the same letter
   (January 2d): "The supplies here alluded to are those which were sent from
   France in the Amphitrite, Seine, and Mercury, about two years ago. They
   had at first the appearance of a present, but whether so or on credit the
   service was a great and a friendly one." To transfer the debt to the
   French government would secure such a long credit that the American cause
   would not suffer. Perhaps no official notice might have been taken of
   this, but in another letter (January 5th) Paine wrote: "Those who are now
   her [America's] allies, prefaced that alliance by an early and generous
   friendship; yet that we might not attribute too much to human or auxiliary
   aid, so unfortunate were these supplies that only one ship out of three
   arrived; the Mercury and Seine fell into the hands of the enemy."

   It was this last paragraph that constituted Paine's indiscretion. Unless
   we can suppose him for once capable of a role so Machiavellian as the
   forcing of France's hand, by revealing the connection between the King and
   the subsidies of Beaumarchais, we can only praise him for a too-impulsive
   and self-forgetting patriotism. It was of course necessary for the French
   Minister (Gerard) to complain, and for Congress to soothe him by voting
   the fiction that his most Christian Majesty "did not preface his alliance
   with any supplies whatever sent to America." But in order to do this,
   Paine had somehow to be dealt with. A serio-comical performance took place
   in Congress. The members knew perfectly well that Paine had documents to
   prove every word he had printed; but as they did not yet know these
   documents officially, and were required by their ally's minister to deny
   Paine's statement, they were in great fear that Paine, if summoned, might
   reveal them. As the articles were only signed "Common Sense," it was
   necessary that the Secretary should acknowledge himself their author, and
   Congress, in dread of discovering its own secrets, contrived that he
   should be allowed to utter at the bar only one word.

   Congress received M. Gerard's complaint on January 5th, and on the 6th, to
   which action thereon had been adjourned, the following memorial from
   Paine. 

   "HONORABLE SIRS.

   "Understanding that exceptions have been taken at some parts of my
   conduct, which exceptions as I am unacquainted with I cannot reply to: I
   therefore humbly beg leave to submit every part of my conduct public and
   private, so far as relate to public measures, to the judgment of this
   Honble. House, to be by them approved or censured as they shall judge
   proper -- at the same time reserving to myself that conscious satisfaction
   of having ever intended well and to the best of my abilities executed
   those intentions.

   "The Honble. Congress in April, 1777, were pleased, not only unsolicited
   on my part, but wholly unknown to me, to appoint me unanimously Secretary
   to the Committee for foreign affairs, which mode of appointment I conceive
   to be the most honorable that can take place. The salary they were pleased
   to affix to it was 70 dollars per month. It has remained at the same rate
   ever since, and is not at this time equal to the most moderate expences I
   can live at; yet I have never complained, and always conceiving it my duty
   to bear a share of the inconveniences of the country, have ever cheerfully
   submitted to them. This being my situation, I am at this time conscious of
   no error, unless the cheapness of my services, and the generosity with,
   which I have endeavored to do good in other respects, can be imputed to me
   as a crime, by such individuals as may have acted otherwise.

   "As my appointment was honbrable, therefore whenever it shall appear to
   Congress that I have not fulfilled their expectations, I shall, tho' with
   concern at any misapprehension that might lead to such an opinion,
   surrender up the books and papers intrusted to my care.

   "Were my appointment an office of profit it might become me to resign it,
   but as it is otherwise I conceive that such a step in me might imply a
   dissatisfaction on account of the smallness of the pay. Therefore I think
   it my duty to wait the orders of this Honble. House, at the same time
   begging leave to assure them that whatever may be their determination
   respecting me, my disposition to serve in so honorable a cause, and in any
   character in which I can best do it, will suffer no alteration.

   I am, with profound respect, your Honors' dutiful and obt. hble. Servant, 

   "THOMAS  PAINE."
   On the same day Paine was summoned before Congress (sitting -- always with
   closed doors), and asked by its president (Jay) if he wrote the articles.
   He replied "Yes," and was instantly ordered to withdraw. On the following
   day Paine, having discovered that Deane's party were resolved that he
   should have no opportunity to reveal any fact in Congress, submitted a
   second memorial. 

   "HONORABLE SIRS.

   "From the manner in which I was called before the House yesterday, I have
   reason to suspect an unfavorable disposition in them towards some parts in
   my late publications. What the parts are against which they object, or
   what those objections are, are wholly unknown to me. If any gentleman has
   presented any Memorial to this House which contains any charge against me,
   or any-ways alludes in a censurable manner to my character or interest, so
   as to become the ground of any such charge, I request, as a servant under
   your authority, an attested copy of that charge, and in my present
   character as a freeman of this country, I demand it. I attended at the bar
   of this House yesterday as their servant, tho' the warrant did not express
   my official station, which I conceive it ought to have done, otherwise it
   could not have been compulsive unless backed by a magistrate. My hopes
   were that I should be made acquainted with the charge, and admitted to my
   defence, which I am all times ready to make either in writing or
   personally.

   "I cannot in duty to my character as a freeman submit to be censured
   unheard. I have evidence which I presume will justify me. And I entreat
   this House to consider how great their reproach will be should it be told
   that they passed a sentence upon me without hearing me, and that a copy of
   the charge against me was refused to me; and likewise how much that
   reproach will be aggravated should I afterwards prove the censure of this
   House to be a libel, grounded upon a mistake which they refused fully to
   inquire into.

   "I make my application to the heart of every gentleman in this House,
   that, before he decides on a point that may affect my reputation, he will
   duly consider his own. Did I court popular praise I should not send this
   letter. My wish is that by thus stating my situation to the House, they
   may not commit an act they cannot justify.

   "I have obtained fame, honor, and credit in this country. I am proud of
   these honors. And as they cannot be taken from me by any unjust censure
   grounded on a concealed charge, therefore it will become my duty
   afterwards to do justice to myself. I have no favor to ask more than to be
   candidly and honorably dealt by; and such being my right I ought to have
   no doubt but this House will proceed accordingly. Should Congress be
   disposed to hear me, I have to request that they will give me sufficient
   time to prepare."
   It was, of course, a foregone conclusion that the story of what had
   occurred in France must not be told. M. Gerard had identified himself with
   the interests of Beaumarchais, as well as with those of his government,
   and was using the privileges of the alliance to cover that speculator's
   demand. Paine, therefore, pleaded in vain. Indeed, the foregoing memorial
   seems to have been suppressed, as it is not referred to in the Journal of
   the House for that day (January 7th). On the day following his resignation
   was presented in the following letter: 

   "HONORABLE SIRS.

   "Finding by the journals of this House, of yesterday, that I am not to be
   heard, and having in my letter of the same day, prior to that resolution,
   declared that I could not `in duty to my character as a freeman submit to
   be censured unheard,' therefore, consistent with that declaration, and to
   maintain that Right, I think it my duty to resign the office of Secretary
   to the Committee for foreign Affairs, and I do hereby resign the same. The
   Papers and documents in my charge I shall faithfully deliver up to the
   Committee, either on honor or oath, as they or this House shall direct.

   "Considering myself now no longer a servant of Congress, I conceive it
   convenient that I should declare what have been the motives of my conduct.
   On the appearance of Mr. Deane's Address to the Public of the 5 of Dec, in
   which he said, `The ears of the Representatives were shut against him,'
   the honor and justice of this House were impeached and its reputation sunk
   to the lowest ebb in the opinion of the People. The expressions of
   suspicion and degradation which have been uttered in my hearing and are
   too indecent to be related in this letter, first induced me to set the
   Public right; but so grounded were they, almost without exception, in
   their ill opinion of this House, that instead of succeeding as I wished in
   my first address, I fell under the same reproach and was frequently told
   that I was defending Congress in their bad designs. This obliged me to go
   farther into the matters, and I have now reason to believe that my
   endeavours have been and will be effectual.

   "My wish and my intentions in all my late publications were to preserve
   the public from error and imposition, to support as far as laid in my
   power the just authority of the Representatives of the People, and to
   cordiallize and cement the Union that has so happily taken place between
   this country and France.

   "I have betrayed no Trust because I have constantly employed that Trust to
   the public good. I have revealed no secrets because I have told nothing
   that was, or I conceive ought to be a secret. I have convicted Mr. Deane
   of error, and in so doing I hope I have done my duty.

   "It is to the interest of the Alliance that the People should know that
   before America had any agent in Europe the 'public spirited gentlemen' in
   that quarter of the world were her warm friends. And I hope this Honorable
   House will receive it from me as a farther testimony of my affection to
   that Alliance, and of my attention to the duty of my office, that I
   mention, that the duplicates of the Dispatches of Oct. 6 and 7, 1777, from
   the Commissioners, the originals of which are in the Enemy's possession,
   seem to require on that account a reconsideration.

   "His Excellency, the Minister of France, is well acquainted with the
   liberality of my sentiments, and I have had the pleasure of receiving
   repeated testimonies of his esteem for me. I am concerned that he should
   in any instance misconceive me. I beg likewise to have it understood that
   my appeal to this Honorable House for a hearing yesterday was as a matter
   of Right in the character of a Freeman, which Right I ought to yield up to
   no Power whatever. I return my utmost thanks to the Honorable Members of
   this House who endeavored to support me in that Right, so sacred to
   themselves and to their constituents; and I have the pleasure of saying
   and reflecting that as I came into office an honest man, I go out of it
   with the same character."
   This letter also was suppressed, and the same fate was secured by Mr. Jay
   for several other letters written by Paine to Congress. On March 30, 1779,
   he quotes a letter of the commissioners of November 30, 1777, saying that
   the supplies from France were "the effects of private benevolence." On
   April 21st he reminds Congress that "they began their hard treatment of me
   while I was defending their injured and insulted honor, and which I cannot
   account for on any other ground than supposing that a private
   unwarrantable connection was formed between Mr. Deane and certain Members
   of this Honorable House." On April 23d he again addresses the, 

   "HONORABLE SIRS:"

   "On inquiring yesterday of Mr. Thomson, your Secretary, I find that no
   answer is given to any of my letters. I am unable to account for the
   seeming inattention of Congress in collecting information at this
   particular time, from whatever quarter it may come; and this wonder is the
   more increased when I recollect that a private offer was made to me, about
   three months ago, amounting in money to -L-700 a year; yet however polite
   the proposal might be, or however friendly it might be designed, I thought
   it my duty to decline it; as it was accompanied with a condition which I
   conceived had a tendency to prevent the information I have since given,
   and shall yet give to the Country on Public Affairs.

   "I have repeatedly wrote to Congress respecting Mr. Deane's dark
   incendiary conduct, and offered every information in my power. The
   opportunities I have had of knowing the state of foreign affairs is
   greater than that of many gentlemen of this House, and I want no other
   knowledge to declare that I look on Mr. Deane to be, what Mr. Carmichael
   calls him, a rascal."
   The offer of money came from M. Gerard. This clever diplomatist perceived
   in all Paine's letters his genuine love of France, and esteem for the King
   who had so generously allied himself with the Americans in their struggle
   for independence. Since M. Gerard's arrival Paine had been on friendly
   terms with him. I have explored the State Archives of France for M.
   Gerard's versions of these affairs, and find them more diplomatic than
   exact. Immediately on the appearance of Paine's first attack on Deane, the
   Minister appears to have visited Paine. He reports to Vergennes, January
   10th, that he had been at much pains to convince Paine of his error in
   saying that the supplies furnished by Beaumarchais had been "promised as a
   gift"; but he had not retracted, and he (Gerard) then thought it necessary
   to refer what he wrote to Congress. "Congress, however, did not wait for
   this to show me its indignation." The journals of Congress do not,
   however, reveal any reference to the matter previous to M. Gerard's
   memorial of January 5th. In his next letter M. Gerard asserts that
   Congress had dismissed Paine, whereas Paine resigned, and a motion for his
   dismission was lost. This letter is dated January 17th. 

   "When I had denounced to Congress the assertions of M. Payne, I did not
   conceal from myself the bad effects that might result to a head puffed up
   by the success of his political writings, and the importance he affected.
   I foresaw the loss of his office, and feared that, separated from the
   support which has restrained him, he would seek only to avenge himself
   with his characteristic impetuosity and impudence. All means of
   restraining him would be impossible, considering the enthusiasm here for
   the license of the press, and in the absence of any laws to repress
   audacity even against foreign powers. The only remedy, my lord, I could
   imagine to prevent these inconveniences, and even to profit by the
   circumstances, was to have Payne offered a salary in the King's name, in
   place of that he had lost. He called to thank me, and I stipulated that he
   should publish nothing on political affairs, nor about Congress, without
   advising with me, and should employ his pen mainly in impressing on the
   people favorable sentiments towards France and the Alliance, of the kind
   fittest to foster hatred and defiance towards England. He appeared to
   accept the task with pleasure. I promised him a thousand dollars per
   annum, to begin from the time of his dismission by Congress. He has
   already begun his functions in declaring in the Gazette that the affair of
   the military effects has no reference to the Court and is not apolitical
   matter. You know too well the prodigious effects produced by the writings
   of this famous personage among the people of the States to cause me any
   fear of your disapproval of my resolution."
   M. Gerard adds that he has also employed Dr. Cooper, an intimate friend of
   Dr. Franklin. On May 29th he informs Vergennes that the Paine arrangement
   did not work. 

   "A piece in a Gazette of the third by M. Payne, under his usual title of
   Common Sense proves his loss of it. In it he declares that he is the only
   honest man thus far employed in American affairs, and demands that the
   nation shall give him the title and authority of Censor-general,
   especially to purify and reform Congress. This bit of folly shows what he
   is capable of. He gives me marks of friendship, but that does not
   contribute to the success of my exhortations."
   In another despatch of the same date M. Gerard writes: 

   "I have had the honor to acquaint you with the project I had formed to
   engage Mr. Payne [le Sr. Payne] to insert in the public papers paragraphs
   relative to the Alliance, calculated to encourage the high idea formed by
   the people of the king, and its confidence in his friendship; but this
   writer having tarnished his reputation and being sold to the opposition, I
   have found another."
   He goes on to say that he has purchased two eminent gentlemen, who write
   under the names "Honest Politician" and "Americanus."

   M. Gerard, in his statements concerning his relations with Paine, depended
   on the unfamiliarity of Vergennes with the Philadelphia journals. In these
   Paine had promptly made known the overtures made to him.

   "Had I been disposed to make money I undoubtedly had many opportunities
   for it. The single pamphlet `Common Sense' would at that time of day have
   produced a tolerable fortune, had I only taken the same profits from the
   publication which all writers have ever done; because the sale was the
   most rapid and extensive of anything that was ever published in this
   country, or perhaps in any other. Instead of which I reduced the price so
   low, that instead of getting, I stand -L-39, 11, 0 out of pocket on Mr.
   Bradford's books, exclusive of my time and trouble; and I have acted the
   same disinterested part by every publication I have made.

   "At the time the dispute arose respecting Mr. Deane's affairs, I had a
   conference with Mr. Gerard at his own request, and some matters on that
   subject were freely talked over, which it is here necessary to mention.
   This was on the 2d of January. On the evening of the same day, or the
   next, Mr. Gerard through the medium of another gentleman made me a very
   genteel and profitable offer. My answer to the offer was precisely in
   these words: `Any service I can render to either of the countries in
   alliance, or to both, I ever have done and shall readily do, and Mr.
   Gerard's esteem will be the only compensation I shall desire.' "
   Paine never received a cent of M. Gerard's money, but he became convinced
   that the French government might be compromised by his allusion to its
   early generosity to America, and on January 26th wrote that the letter to
   which he had alluded had not mentioned "the King of France by any name or
   title nor yet the nation of France." This was all that the French Minister
   could get out of Paine, and it was willingly given. The more complaisant
   "Honest Politician" and "Americanus," however, duly fulfilled the tasks
   for which they had been employed by the French Ambassador. This will be
   seen by reference to their letters in the Pennsylvania Gazette of June
   23d. In June and July Paine entered on a controversy with "Americanus" on
   the terms upon which America should insist, in any treaty of peace. He
   intimates his suspicion that "Americanus" is a hireling.

   It should be 'mentioned that the English archives prove that in Paris
   Deane and Gerard had long been intimate, and often closeted with
   Vergennes. (See the reports of Wentworth and others in
   Stevens' Facsimiles.)   Deane and Gerard came over together, on one of
   d'Estaing's ships. According to the English information Gerard was
   pecuniarily interested in the supplies sent to America, and if so had
   private reasons for resisting Paine's theory of their gratuitous
   character.

                                   CHAPTER  X

                         A STORY BY GOUVERNEUR MORRIS 
                                     [1779]

   THE Paine-Deane incident had a number of curious sequels, some of which
   are related in a characteristic letter of Gouverneur Morris to John
   Randolph, which has not, I believe, hitherto been printed. Gouverneur
   Morris had much to do with the whole affair; he was a member of Congress
   during the controversy, and he was the Minister in France who, fifteen
   years later, brought to light the receipt for the King's million livres
   charged by Beaumarchais against this country. 

   "WASHINGTON, Jany. 20, 1812.

   "It would give me pleasure to communicate the information you ask, but I
   can only speak from memory respecting matters, some of which were
   transacted long ago and did not command my special attention. But it is
   probable that the material facts can be established by documents in the
   Secretary of State's office.

   "It will, I believe, appear from the correspondence between Mr. Arthur Lee
   and the Secret and Commercial Committee, that early in our dispute with
   Great Britain the French Court made through him a tender of military
   supplies, and employed as their agent for that purpose M; Beaumarchais,
   who, having little property and but slender standing in society, might (if
   needful) be disavowed, imprisoned, and punished for presuming to use the
   King's name on such an occasion. In the course of our Revolutionary War,
   large supplies were sent by M. Beaumarchais under the name of Roderique
   Hortalez and Co., a supposed mercantile name. But the operations were
   impeded by complaints of the British Ambassador, Lord Stormont, which
   obliged the French Court to make frequent denials, protestations, seizure
   of goods and detention of ships. Every step of this kind bound them more
   strongly to prevent a disclosure of facts.

   "After the Congress returned to Philadelphia, M. de Francy, agent of M.
   Beaumarchais, applied to Congress for payment. This application was
   supported on the ground of justice by many who were not in the secret, for
   the Congress had then so much good sense as not to trust itself with its
   own secrets. There happened unluckily at that time a feud between Mr. Lee
   and Mr. Deane. The latter favored (in appearance at least) M.
   Beaumarchais' claim. Paine, who was clerk to the Secret and Commercial
   Committee, took part in the dispute, wrote pieces for the Gazettes, and at
   length, to overwhelm Deane and those who defended him with confusion,
   published a declaration of the facts confidentially communicated to the
   Committee by Mr. Lee, and signed this declaration as American Secretary
   for Foreign Affairs46. The French Minister, M. Gerard, immediately made a
   formal complaint of that publication, and an equally formal denial of what
   it contained. The Congress was therefore obliged to believe, or at least
   to act as if they believed, that Paine had told a scandalous falsehood. He
   was in consequence dismissed, which indeed he deserved for his impudence
   if for nothing else47.

   "Beaumarchais and his agent had already received from the Committee
   tobacco and perhaps other articles of produce on account of his demand;
   what and how much will of course be found from investigating the files of
   the Treasury. But he wanted and finally obtained a larger and more
   effectual payment. Bills were drawn in his favor on Dr. Franklin, our
   Minister in France, at long sight, for about one hundred thousand pounds
   sterling. This was done in the persuasion that the Doctor would, when they
   were presented, communicate the fact to Comte de Vergennes, from whom he
   would afterwards be obliged to solicit the means of payment. It was hoped
   that the French Court would then interfere and either lay hold of the
   bills or compel M. Beaumarchais to refund the money, so that no real
   deduction would on that account be afterwards made from the loans or
   subsidies to us. The death of all who were privy to it has spread an
   impenetrable veil over what passed on this occasion between M.
   Beaumarchais and his employer, but the bills were regularly paid, and we
   were thereby deprived in a critical moment of the resources which so large
   a sum would have supplied. When this happened, M. de la Luzerne, then
   Minister of France at Philadelphia, expressed himself with so much freedom
   and so much indignation respecting M. Beaumarchais and his claim, that
   there was reason to believe nothing more would have been heard of it. In
   that persuasion, perhaps, Dr. Franklin, when he came to settle our
   national accounts with M. de Vergennes, was less solicitous about a
   considerable item than he otherwise might have been. He acknowledged as a
   free gift to the United States the receipt on a certain day of one million
   livres, for which no evidence was produced. He asked indeed for a voucher
   to establish the payment, but the Count replied that it was immaterial
   whether we had received the money or not, seeing that we were not called
   on for repayment. With this reassuring the old gentleman seems to have
   been satisfied, and the account was settled accordingly. Perhaps the facts
   may have been communicated to him under the seal of secrecy, and if so he
   showed firmness in that he had shared in the plunder with Deane and
   Beaumarchais.

   "Things remained in that state till after the late king of France was
   dethroned. The Minister of the United States at Paris48 was then directed
   to enquire what had become of the million livres. The correspondence will
   of course be found in the office of the Secretary of State. It seems that
   he had the good fortune to obtain copies of M. Beaumarchais' receipt for a
   million, bearing date on the day when the gift was said to have been made,
   so that no reasonable doubt could exist as to the identity of the sum49.

   "So much, my dear Sir, for what memory can command. You will, I think,
   find papers containing a more accurate statement in the New York "Evening
   Post," about the time when Mr. Rodney's opinion was made public. At least
   I recollect having seen in that Gazette some facts with which I had not
   been previously acquainted, or which I had forgotten. A gentleman from
   Connecticut, who was on the Committee of Claims last year, can I believe
   give you the papers. I remember also to have been told by a respectable
   young gentleman, son of the late Mr. Richard Henry Lee, that important
   evidence on this subject, secured from his uncle Arthur, was in his
   possession, and I believe it may be obtained from Mr. Carroll of
   Annapolis, or his son-in-law Mr. Harper of Baltimore.50

   "The Hon'le Mr. JOHN RANDOLPH, of Roanoke."
   Beaumarchais, barely escaping the guillotine, died in poverty in Holland.
   He bequeathed his claim to his daughter who (1835) was paid 800,000
   francs, but the million which he had received from the King and then
   charged on the United States, was never paid. Silas Deane suffered a worse
   fate. His claims for commissions and services in France remained unpaid,
   and after his return to France he occupied himself with writing to his
   brother Simeon the letters meant to be intercepted, printed by Rivington
   in 1782. In these letters he urges submission to England. Franklin took
   the charitable view that his head had been turned by his misfortunes. He
   went over to England, where he became the friend of Benedict Arnold, and
   died in poverty in 1789. In recent years his heirs were paid $35,000 by
   Congress. But had his treachery, as now revealed in the letters of George
   III., been known, there would had been no such payment.

   The determination with which Paine, to his cost, withstood Deane, may seem
   at first glance quixotic. His attack was animated by a belief that the
   supplies sent from France were a covert gift, and, at any rate, that the
   demand for instant payment to agents was fraudulent. Evidence having been
   supplied, by the publication of Beaumarchais' notes to Arthur Lee, under
   pseudonym of "Mary Johnston," that returns in tobacco were expected, this,
   if not a mercantile mask, was still a matter of credit, and very different
   from payments demanded by Beaumarchais and Deane from the scanty treasury
   of the struggling colonies51. But there was something more behind the
   vehemence of Paine's letters. This he intimated, but his revelation seems
   to have received no attention at the time.

   He says (January 5th): "In speaking of Mr. Deane's contracts with foreign
   officers, I concealed, out of pity to him, a circumstance that must have
   sufficiently shown the necessity of recalling him, and either his want of
   judgment or the danger of trusting him with discretionary power. It is no
   less than that of his throwing out a proposal, in one of his foreign
   letters, for contracting with a German prince to command the American
   army." This personage, who was "to supersede General Washington," he
   afterwards declares to be Prince Ferdinand. It is known that Count de
   Broglie had engaged Kalb and Deane to propose him as generalissimo of
   America, but the evidence of this other proposal has disappeared with
   other papers missing from Deane 's diplomatic correspondence. I find,
   however, that ex-provost Stille, who has studied the proceedings of
   Beaumarchais thoroughly, has derived from another source an impression
   that he (Beaumarchais) made an earlier proposition of the same kind
   concerning Prince Ferdinand. It would be unsafe to affirm that Deane did
   more than report the proposals made to him, but his silence concerning
   this particular charge of his antagonist, while denying every other
   categorically, is suspicious. At that early period Washington had not
   loomed up in the eye of the world. The French and Germans appear to have
   thought of the Americans and their commander as we might think of
   rebellious red men and their painted chief. There is nothing in Deane's
   letters from Europe to suggest that he did not share their delusion, or
   that he appreciated the necessity of independence. Paine, who conducted
   the foreign correspondence, knew that the secrets of the American office
   in Paris were open to Lord Stormont, who stopped large supplies prepared
   for America, and suspected Deane of treachery. It now appears that one of
   Deane's assistants, George Lupton, was an English "informer."
   (Stevens' Facsimiles, vii., No. 696.)   Deane had midnight meetings in the
   Place Vendome with an English "Unknown" (now known as the informer Paul
   Wentworth) to whom he suggested that the troubles might be ended by
   England's forming a "federal union" with America. All of which shows Deane
   perilously unfit for his mission, but one is glad to find him appearing no
   worse in Wentworth's confidental portraiture (January 4, 1778) of the
   American officials: 

   "Dr. Franklin is taciturn, deliberate, and cautious; Mr. Deane is vain,
   desultory, and subtle; Mr. Arthur Lee, suspicious and indolent; Alderman
   Lee, peevish and ignorant; Mr. Izzard, costive and dogmatical -- all of
   these insidious, and Edwards vibrating between hope and fear, interest and
   attachment."
    

                                  CHAPTER  XI

                             CAUSE, COUNTRY, SELF 
                                  [1779-1780]

   WHATEVER might be thought of Paine's course in the Deane-Beaumarchais
   affair, there could be no doubt that the country was saved from a
   questionable payment unjustly pressed at a time when it must have crippled
   the Revolution, for which the French subsidies were given. Congress was
   relieved, and he who relieved it was the sufferer. From the most important
   congressional secretaryship he was reduced to a clerkship in Owen Biddle's
   law office.

   Paine's patriotic interest in public affairs did not abate. In the summer
   of 1779 he wrote able articles in favor of maintaining our right to the
   Newfoundland fisheries in any treaty of peace that might be made with
   England. Congress was secretly considering what instructions should be
   sent to its representatives in Europe, in case negotiations should arise,
   and the subject was discussed by "Americanus" in a letter to
   the Pennsylvania Gazette, June 23d. This writer argued that the fisheries
   should not be mentioned in such negotiations; England would stickle at the
   claim, and our ally, France, should not be called on to guarantee a right
   which should be left to the determination of natural laws. This position
   Paine combated; he maintained that independence was not a change of
   ministry, but a real thing; it should mean prosperity as well as political
   liberty. Our ally would be aggrieved by a concession to Great Britain of
   any means of making our alliance useful. 

   "There are but two natural sources of wealth -- the Earth and the Ocean,
   -- and to lose the right to either is, in our situation, to put up the
   other for sale." The fisheries are needed, "first, as an
   Employment. Secondly, as producing national Supply and Commerce, and a
   means of national wealth. Thirdly, as a Nursery for Seamen." Should Great
   Britain be in such straits as to ask for peace, that would be the right
   opportunity to settle the matter. "To leave the Fisheries wholly out, on
   any pretence whatever, is to sow the seeds of another war." (Pennsylvania
   Gazette, June 30th, July 14th, 21st.)
   The prospects of peace seemed now sufficiently fair for Paine to give the
   attention which nobody else did to his own dismal situation. His scruples
   about making money out of the national cause were eccentric. The
   manuscript diary of Rickman, just found by Dr. Clair Grece, contains this
   note:

   "Franklin, on returning to America from France, where he had been
   conducting great commercial and other concerns of great import and benefit
   to the States of America, on having his accounts looked over by the
   Committee appointed to do so, there was a deficit of -L-100,000. He was
   asked how this happened. 'I was taught,' said he very gravely, `when a boy
   to read the scriptures and to attend to them, and it is there said: muzzle
   not the ox that treadeth out his master's grain.'   No further inquiry was
   ever made or mention of the deficient -L-100,000, which, it is presumed,
   he devoted to some good and great purpose to serve the people, -- his own
   aim through life."

   Rickman, who named a son after Franklin, puts a more charitable
   construction on the irregularities of the Doctor's accounts than
   Gouverneur Morris (p.140). The anecdote may not be exact, but it was
   generally rumored, in congressional circles, that Franklin had by no means
   been muzzled. Nor does it appear to have been considered a serious matter.
   The standard of political ethics being thus lowered, it is easy to
   understand that Paine gave more offence by his Diogenes-lantern than if he
   had quietly taken his share of the grain he trod out. The security of
   independence and the pressure of poverty rendered it unnecessary to adhere
   to his quixotic Quaker repugnance to the sale of his inspirations, and he
   now desired to collect these into marketable shape. His plans are stated
   in a letter to Henry Laurens. 

   "PHILADELPHIA, Sepr. 14th, 1779.

   "DEAR SIR,

   "It was my intention to have communicated to you the substance of this
   letter last Sunday had I not been prevented by a return of my fever;
   perhaps finding myself unwell, and feeling, as well as apprehending,
   inconveniences, have produced in me some thoughts for myself as well as
   for others. I need not repeat to you the part I have acted or the
   principle I have acted upon; and perhaps America would feel the less
   obligation to me, did she know, that it was neither the place nor the
   people but the Cause itself that irresistibly engaged me in its support;
   for I should have acted the same part in any other Country could the same
   circumstances have arisen there which have happened here. I have often
   been obliged to form this distinction to myself by way of smoothing over
   some disagreeable ingratitudes, which, you well know, have been shewn to
   me from a certain quarter.

   "I find myself so curiously circumstanced that I have both too many
   friends and too few, the generality of them thinking that from the public
   part I have so long acted I cannot have less than a mine to draw from --
   What they have had from me they have got for nothing, and they
   consequently suppose I must be able to afford it. I know but one kind of
   life I am fit for, and that is a thinking one, and, of course, a writing
   one -- but I have confined myself so much of late, taken so little
   exercise, and lived so very sparingly, that unless I alter my way of life
   it will alter me. I think I have a right to ride a horse of my own, but I
   cannot now even afford to hire one, which is a situation I never was in
   before, and I begin to know that a sedentary life cannot be supported
   without jolting exercise. Having said thus much, which, in truth, is but
   loss of time to tell to you who so well know how I am situated, I take the
   liberty of communicating to you my design of doing some degree of justice
   to myself, but even this is accompanied with some present difficulties,
   but it is the easiest, and, I believe, the most useful and reputable of
   any I can think of. I intend this winter to collect all my Publications,
   beginning with "Common Sense" and ending with the fisheries, and
   publishing them in two volumes Octavo, with notes. I have no doubt of a
   large subscription. The principal difficulty will be to get Paper and I
   can think of no way more practicable than to desire Arthur Lee to send
   over a quantity from France in the Confederacy if she goes there, and
   settling for it with his brother. After that work is compleated, I intend
   prosecuting a history of the Revolution by means of a subscription -- but
   this undertaking will be attended with such an amazing expense, and will
   take such a length of Time, that unless the States individually give some
   assistance therein, scarcely any man could afford to go through it. Some
   kind of an history might be easily executed made up of daily events and
   triffling matters which would lose their Importance in a few years. But a
   proper history cannot even be began unless the secrets of the other side
   of the water can be obtained, for the first part is so interwoven with the
   Politics of England, that, that which will be the last to get at must be
   the first to begin with -- and this single instance is sufficient to show
   that no history can take place of some time. My design, if I undertake it,
   is to comprise it in three quarto volumes and to publish one each year
   from the time of beginning, and to make an abridgment afterwards in an
   easy agreeable language for a school book.

   All the histories of ancient wars that are used for this purpose, promotes
   no Moral Reflection, but like the beggars opera renders the villain
   pleasing in the hero. Another thing that will prolong the completion of an
   history is the want of Plates which only can be done in Europe, for that
   part of a history which is intended to convey discription of places or
   persons will ever be imperfect without them. I have now, Sir, acquainted
   you with my design, and unwilling, as you know I am, to make use of a
   friend while I can possibly avoid it, I am really obliged to say that I
   should now be glad to consult with two or three on some matters that
   regard my situation till such time as I can bring the first of those
   subscriptions to bear, or set them on foot, which cannot well be until I
   can get the paper; for should I [be] disappointed of that, with the
   subscriptions in my hand, I might be reflected upon, and the reason, tho'
   a true one, would be subject to other explanations.

   "Here lies the difficulty I alluded to in the beginning of this letter,
   and I would rather wish to borrow something of a friend or two in the
   interim than run the risk I have mentioned, because should I be
   disappointed by the Paper being taken or not arriving in time, the reason
   being understood by them beforehand will not injure me, but in the other
   case it would, and in the mean Time I can be preparing for publication. I
   have hitherto kept all my private matters a secret, but as I know your
   friendship and you a great deal of my situation, I can with more ease
   communicate them to you than to another. 

   "P. S. If you are not engaged to-morrow evening I should be glad to spend
   part of it with you -- if you are, I shall wait your opportunity."52
   It was a cruel circumstance of Paine's poverty that he was compelled to
   call attention not only to that but to his services, and to appraise the
   value of his own pen. He had to deal with hard men, on whom reserve was
   wasted. On September 28th he reminded the Excutive Council of Pennsylvania
   of his needs and his uncompensated services, which, he declared, he could
   not afford to continue without support. The Council realized the
   importance of Paine's pen to its patriotic measures, but was afraid of
   offending the French Minister. Its president, Joseph Reed, on the
   following day (September 29th) wrote to that Minister intimating that they
   would like to employ Paine if he (the minister) had no objection. On
   October 11th Gerard replies with a somewhat equivocal letter, in which he
   declares that Paine had agreed to terms he had offered through M. de
   Mirales, but had not fulfilled them. "I willingly," he says, "leave M.
   Payne to enjoy whatever advantages he promises himself by his denial of
   his acceptance of the offers of M. de Mirales and myself. I would even
   add, Sir, that if you feel able to direct his pen in a way useful to the
   public welfare -- which will perhaps not be difficult to your zeal,
   talents, and superior lights, -- I will be the first to applaud the
   success of an attempt in which I have failed."53 On the same date Paine,
   not having received any reply to his previous letter, again wrote to the
   Council. 

   "HONBLE. SIRS.

   "Some few days ago I presented a letter to this Honble. Board stating the
   inconveniences which I lay under from an attention to public interest in
   preference to my own, to which I have recd. no reply. It is to me a matter
   of great concern to find in the government of this State, that which
   appears to be a disposition in them to neglect their friends and to throw
   discouragements in the way of genius and Letters.

   At the particular request of the Gentleman who presides at this board, I
   took up the defence of the Constitution, at a time when he declared to me
   that unless he could be assisted he must give it up and quit the state; as
   matters then pressed too heavy upon him, and the opposition was gaining
   ground; yet this Board has since suffered me to combat with all the
   inconveniences incurred by that service, without my attention to my
   interest or my situation. For the sake of not dishonoring a cause, good in
   itself, I have hitherto been silent on these matters, but I cannot help
   expressing to this board the concern I feel on this occasion, and the ill
   effect which such discouraging examples will have on those who might
   otherwise be disposed to act as I have done.

   "Having said this much, which is but a little part of which I am sensible,
   I have a request to make which if complied with will enable me to overcome
   the difficulties alluded to and to withdraw from a service in which I have
   experienced nothing but misfortune and neglect. I have an opportunity of
   importing a quantity of printing paper from France, and intend collecting
   my several pieces, beginning with Common Sense, into two Volumes, and
   publishing them by Subscription, with notes; but as I cannot think of
   beginning the Subscription until the paper arrive, and as the undertaking,
   exclusive of the paper, will be attended with more expense than I, who
   have saved money both in the Service of the Continent and the State, can
   bear, I should be glad to be assisted with the loan of fifteen hundred
   pounds for which I will give bond payable within a year. If this should
   not be complied with, I request that the services I have rendered may be
   taken into consideration and such compensation made me therefor as they
   shall appear to deserve.

   "I am, Honble. Sirs, your obt. and humble servt., 

   "THOMAS  PAINE."
   The constitution which Paine, in the above letter, speaks of defending was
   that of 1776, which he had assisted Dr. Franklin, James Cannon and others
   in framing for Pennsylvania. It was a fairly republican constitution, and
   by its enfranchisement of the people generally reduced the power enjoyed
   by the rich and reactionary under the colonial government. In Stille's
   biography of John Dickinson the continued conflicts concerning this
   constitution are described. In 1805, when a constitutional convention was
   proposed in Pennsylvania, Paine pointed out the superiority of its
   constitution of 1776, which "was conformable to the Declaration of
   Independence and the Declaration of Rights, which the present constitution
   [framed in 1790] is not54." The constitution of 1776, and Paine's exposure
   of the services rendered to the enemy by Quakers, cleared the Pennsylvania
   Assembly of the members of that society who had been supreme. This process
   had gone on. The oath of allegiance to the State, proposed by Paine in
   1777, and adopted, had been followed in 1778 (April 1st) by one imposing
   renunciation of all allegiance to George III., his heirs and successors,
   to be taken by all trustees, provosts, professors, and masters. This was
   particularly aimed at the nest of "Tories" in the University of
   Philadelphia, whose head was the famous Dr. William Smith. This provost,
   and all members of the University except three trustees, took the oath,
   but the influence of those who had been opposed to independence remained
   the same. In 1779 the Assembly got rid of the provost (Smith), and this
   was done by the act of November which took away the charter of the
   University55. It was while this agitation was going on, and the
   Philadelphia "Tories" saw the heads of their chieftains falling beneath
   Paine's pen, that his own official head had been thrown to them by his own
   act. The sullen spite of the "Tories" did not fail to manifest itself. In
   conjunction with Deane's defeated friends, they managed to give Paine many
   a personal humiliation. This was, indeed, easy enough, since Paine, though
   willing to fight for his cause, was a non-resistant in his own behalf. It
   may have been about this time that an incident occurred which was
   remembered with gusto by the aged John Joseph Henry after the "Age of
   Reason" had added horns and cloven feet to his early hero. Mr. Mease,
   Clothier-General, gave a dinner party, and a company of his guests, on
   their way home, excited by wine, met Paine. One of them remarking, "There
   comes `Common Sense,' " Matthew Slough said, "Damn him, I shall
   common-sense him," and thereupon tripped Paine into the gutter56.

   But patriotic America was with Paine, and missed his pen; for
   no Crisis had appeared for nearly a year. Consequently on November 2,
   1779, the Pennsylvania Assembly elected him its Clerk.

   On the same day there was introduced into that Assembly an act for the
   abolition of slavery in the State, which then contained six thousand negro
   slaves. The body of this very moderate measure was prepared by George
   Bryan, but the much admired preamble has been attributed by tradition to
   the pen of Paine57. That this tradition is correct is now easily proved by
   a comparison of its sentiments and phraseology with the antislavery
   writings of Paine presented in previous pages of this work. The author,
   who alone seems to have been thinking of the negroes and their rights
   during that revolutionary epoch, thus had some reward in writing the first
   proclamation of emancipation in America. The act passed March 1, 1780. The
   Preamble is as follows:

   "I. When we contemplate our abhorrence of that condition, to which the
   arms and tyranny of Great Britain were exerted to reduce us, when we look
   back on the variety of dangers to which we have been exposed, and how
   miraculously our wants in many instances have been supplied, and our
   deliverances wrought, when even hope and human fortitude have become
   unequal to the conflict, we are unavoidably led to a serious and grateful
   sense of the manifold blessings, which we have undeservedly received from
   the hand of that Being, from whom every good and perfect gift cometh.
   Impressed with these ideas, we conceive that is is our duty, and we
   rejoice that it is in our power, to extend a portion of that freedom to
   others, which hath been extended to us, and release from that state of
   thraldom, to which we ourselves were tyrannically doomed, and from which
   we have now every prospect of being delivered. It is not for us to enquire
   why, in the creation of mankind, the inhabitants of the several parts of
   the earth were distinguished by a difference in feature or complexion. It
   is sufficient to know that all are the work of the Almighty Hand. We find
   in the distribution of the human species, that the most fertile as well as
   the most barren parts of the earth are inhabited by men of complexions
   different from ours, and from each other; from whence we may reasonably as
   well as religiously infer, that He, who placed them in their various
   situations, hath extended equally his care and protection to all, and that
   it becometh not us to counteract his mercies. We esteem it a peculiar
   blessing granted to us, that we are enabled this day to add one more step
   to universal civilization, by removing, as much as possible, the sorrows
   of those, who have lived in undeserved bondage, and from which, by the
   assumed authority of the Kings of Great Britain, no effectual, legal
   relief could be obtained. Weaned, by a long course of experience, from
   those narrow prejudices and partialities we had imbibed, we find our
   hearts enlarged with kindness and benevolence towards men of all
   conditions and nations; and we conceive ourselves at this particular
   period particularly called upon by the blessings which we have received,
   to manifest the sincerity of our profession, and to give a substantial
   proof of our gratitude.

   "II. And whereas the condition of those persons, who have heretofore been
   denominated Negro and Mulatto slaves, has been attended with
   circumstances, which not only deprived them of the common blessings that
   they were by nature entitled to, but has cast them into the deepest
   afflictions, by an unnatural separation and sale of husband and wife from
   each other and from their children, an injury, the greatness of which can
   only be conceived by supposing that we were in the same unhappy case. In
   justice, therefore, to persons so unhappily circumstanced, and who, having
   no prospect before them whereon they may rest their sorrows and their
   hopes, have no reasonable inducement to render their service to society,
   which they otherwise might, and also in grateful commemoration of our own
   happy deliverance from that state of unconditional submission to which we
   were doomed by the tyranny of Britain.

   "III. Be it enacted, &e."

   New Year, 1780, found Washington amid much distress at Morristown. Besides
   the published letters which attest this I have found an extract from one
   which seems to have escaped the attention of Washington's editors.58 It
   was written at Morristown, January 5th. 

   "It gives me extreme Pain that I should still be holding up to Congress
   our wants on the score of Provision, when I am convinced that they are
   doing all that they can for our relief. Duty and necessity, however,
   constrain me to it. The inclosed copies of Letters from Mr. Flint, the
   Assistant Commissary, and from Gen. Irvine, who commands at present our
   advanced troops, contain a just Representation of our situation. To add to
   our Difficulties very much fear that the late violent snow storm has so
   blocked up the Roads, that it will be some days before the scanty supplies
   in this quarter can be brought to camp. The troops, both officers and men,
   have borne their Distress, with a patience scarcely to be conceived. Many
   of the latter have been four or five days without meat entirely and short
   of Bread, and none but very scanty Supplies -- Some for their preservation
   have been compelled to maraud and rob from the Inhabitants, and I have it
   not in my power to punish or reprove the practice. If our condition should
   not undergo a very speedy and considerable change for the better, it will
   be difficult to point out all the consequences that may ensue. About forty
   of the Cattle mentioned by Mr. Flint got in last night."
   The times that tried men's souls had come again. The enemy, having
   discovered the sufferings of the soldiers at Morristown, circulated
   leaflets inviting them to share the pleasures of New York. Nor were they
   entirely unsuccessful. On May 28th was penned the gloomiest letter
   Washington ever wrote. It was addressed to Reed, President of
   Pennsylvania, and the Clerk (Paine) read it to the Assembly. "I assure
   you," said the Commander's letter, "every idea you can form of our
   distresses will fall short of the reality. There is such a combination of
   circumstances to exhaust the patience of the soldiery that it begins at
   length to be worn out, and we see in every line of the army the most
   serious features of mutiny and sedition." There was throughout the long
   letter a tone of desperation which moved the Assembly profoundly. At the
   close there was a despairing silence, amid which a member arose and said,
   "We may as well give up first as last." The treasury was nearly empty, but
   enough remained to pay Paine his salary, and he headed a subscription of
   relief with $50059. The money was enclosed to Mr. M'Clenaghan, with a
   vigorous letter which that gentleman read to a meeting held in a
   coffee-house the same evening. Robert Morris and M'Clenaghan subscribed
   -L-200 each, hard money. The subscription, dated June 8th, spread like
   wildfire, and resulted in the raising of -L-300,000, which established a
   bank that supplied the army through the campaign, and was incorporated by
   Congress on December 21st.

   Paine, by his timely suggestion of a subscription, and his "mite," as he
   called it, proved that he could meet a crisis as well as write one. He had
   written a cheery Crisis in March, had helped to make good its hopefulness
   in May, and was straightway busy on another. This was probably begun on
   the morning when M'Clenaghan came to him with a description of the happy
   effect and result produced by his letter and subscription on the gentlemen
   met at the coffee-house. This Crisis (June 9, 1780) declares that the
   reported fate of Charleston, like the misfortunes of 1776, had revived the
   same spirit; that such piecemeal work was not conquering the continent;
   that France was at their side; that an association had been formed for
   supplies, and hard-money bounties. In a postscript he adds: 

   "Charleston is gone, and I believe for the want of a sufficient supply of
   provisions. The man that does not now feel for the honor of the best and
   noblest cause that ever a country engaged in, and exert himself
   accordingly, is no longer worthy of a peaceable residence among a people
   determined to be free."
   Meanwhile, on "Sunday Morning, June 4th," Paine wrote to President Reed a
   private letter: 

   "SIR,

   "I trouble you with a few thoughts on the present state of affairs. Every
   difficulty we are now in arises from an empty treasury and an exhausted
   credit. These removed and the prospect were brighter. While the war was
   carried on by emissions at the pleasure of Congress, any body of men might
   conduct public business, and the poor were of equal use in government with
   the rich. But when the means must be drawn from the country the case
   becomes altered, and unless the wealthier part throw in their aid, public
   measures must go heavily on.

   "The people of America understand rights better than politics. They have a
   clear idea of their object, but are greatly deficient in comprehending the
   means. In the first place, they do not distinguish between sinking the
   debt, and raising the current expenses. They want to have the war carried
   on, the Lord knows how.

   "It is always dangerous to spread an alarm of danger unless the prospect
   of success be held out with it, and that not only as probable, but
   naturally essential. These things premised, I beg leave to mention, that
   suppose you were to send for some of the richer inhabitants of the City,
   and state to them the situation of the army and the treasury, not as
   arising so much from defect in the departments of government as from a
   neglect in the country generally, in not contributing the necessary
   support in time. If they have any spirit, any foresight of their own
   interest or danger, they will promote a subscription either of money or
   articles, and appoint a committee from among themselves to solicit the
   same in the several Counties; and one State setting the example, the rest,
   I presume, will follow. Suppose it was likewise proposed to them to
   deposit their plate to be coined for the pay of the Army, crediting the
   government for the value, by weight.

   "If measures of this kind could be promoted by the richer of the Whigs, it
   would justify your calling upon the other part to furnish their proportion
   without ceremony, and these two measures carried, would make a draft or
   call for personal service the more palatable and easy.

   "I began to write this yesterday. This morning, it appears clear to me
   that Charleston is in the hands of the enemy, and the garrison prisoners
   of war. Something must be done, and that something, to give it popularity,
   must begin with men of property. Every care ought now to be taken to keep
   goods from rising. The rising of goods will have a most ruinous ill effect
   in every light in which it can be viewed.

   "The army must be reunited, and that by the most expeditious possible
   means. Drafts should first be countenanced by subscriptions, and if men
   would but reason rightly, they would see that there are some thousands in
   this State who had better subscribe thirty, forty, or fifty guineas apiece
   than run the risk of having to settle with the enemy. Property is always
   the object of a conqueror, wherever he can find it. A rich man, says King
   James, makes a bonny traitor; and it cannot be supposed that Britain will
   not reimburse herself by the wealth of others, could she once get the
   power of doing it. We must at least recruit eight or ten thousand men in
   this State, who had better raise a man apiece, though it should cost them
   a thousand pounds apiece, than not have a sufficient force, were it only
   for safety sake. Eight or ten thousand men, added to what we have now got,
   with the force that may arrive, would enable us to make a stroke at New
   York, to recover the loss of Charleston -- but the measure must be
   expeditious.

   "I suggest another thought. Suppose every man, working a plantation, who
   has not taken the oath of allegiance, in Philadelphia County, Bucks,
   Chester, Lancaster, Northampton, and Berks, were, by the new power vested
   in the Council, called immediately upon for taxes in kind at a certain
   value. Horses and wagons to be appraised. This would not only give
   immediate relief, but popularity to the new power. I would remark of taxes
   in kind, that they are hard-money taxes, and could they be established on
   the non-jurors, would relieve us in the articles of supplies.

   "But whatever is necessary or proper to be done, must be done immediately.
   We must rise vigorously upon the evil, or it will rise upon us. A show of
   spirit will grow into real spirit, but the Country must not be suffered to
   ponder over their loss for a day. The circumstance of the present hour
   will justify any means from which good may arise. We want rousing.

   "On the loss of Charleston I would remark -- the expectation of a foreign
   force arriving will embarrass them whether to go or to stay; and in either
   case, what will they do with their prisoners? If they return, they will be
   but as they were as to dominion; if they continue, they will leave New
   York an attackable post. They can make no new movements for a considerable
   time. They may pursue their object to the Southward in detachments, but
   then in every main point they will naturally be at a stand; and we ought
   immediately to lay hold of the vacancy.

   "I am, Sir, your obedient humble servant, 

   "THOMAS  PAINE."
   If Paine had lost any popularity in consequence of his indirect censure by
   Congress, a year before, it had been more than regained by his action in
   heading the subscription, and the inspiriting effect of his pamphlets of
   March and June, 1780. The University of the State of Pennsylvania, as it
   was now styled, celebrated the Fourth of July by conferring on him the
   degree of Master of Arts60. Among the trustees who voted to confer on him
   this honor were some who had two years before refused to take the American
   oath of allegiance.

   In the autumn appeared Paine's Crisis Extraordinary. It would appear by a
   payment made to him personally, that in order to make his works cheap he
   had been compelled to take his publications into his own hands61. The sum
   of $360 paid for ten dozen copies of this pamphlet was really at the rate
   of five cents per copy. It is a forcible reminder of the depreciation of
   the Continental currency. At one period Paine says he paid $300 for a pair
   of woollen stockings.

   Although the financial emergency had been tided over by patriotic
   sacrifices, it had disclosed a chaos. Congress, so far from being able to
   contend with Virginia on a point of sovereignty, was without power to levy
   taxes. "One State," writes Washington (May 31st) "will comply with a
   requisition of Congress; another neglects to do it; a third executes it by
   halves; and all differ either in the manner, the matter, or so much in
   point of time, that we are always working up hill, and ever shall be; and,
   while such a system as the present one or rather want of one prevails, we
   shall ever be unable to apply our strength or resources to any advantage."
   In the letter of May 28th, to the President of Pennsylvania, which led to
   the subscription headed by Paine, Washington pointed out that the
   resources of New York and Jersey were exhausted, that Virginia could spare
   nothing from the threatened South, and Pennsylvania was their chief
   dependence. "The crisis, in every point of view, is extraordinary." This
   sentence of Washington probably gave Paine his title, Crisis
   Extraordinary. It is in every sense a masterly production. By a careful
   estimate he shows that the war and the several governments cost two
   millions sterling annually. The population being 3,000,000, the amount
   would average 13s. 4d. per head. In England the taxation was -L-2 per
   head. With independence a peace establishment in America would cost 5s.
   per head; with the loss of it Americans would have to pay the -L-2 per
   head like other English subjects. Of the needed annual two millions,
   Pennsylvania's quota would be an eighth, or -L-250,000; that is, a
   shilling per month to her 375,000 inhabitants, -- which subjugation would
   increase to three-and-three-pence per month. He points out that the
   Pennsylvanians were then paying only -L-64,280 per annum, instead of their
   real quota of -L-250,000, leaving a deficiency of -L-185,720, and
   consequently a distressed army. After showing that with peace and free
   trade all losses and ravages would be speedily redressed, Paine proposes
   that half of Pennsylvania's quota, and -L-60,000 over, shall be raised by
   a tax of 7s. per head. With this sixty thousand (interest on six millions)
   a million can be annually borrowed. He recommends a war-tax on landed
   property, houses, imports, prize goods, and liquors. "It would be an
   addition to the pleasures of society to know that, when the health of the
   army goes round, a few drops from every glass become theirs."

   On December 30, 1780, Dunlap advertised Paine's pamphlet "Public Good."
   Under a charter given the Virginia Company in 1609 the State of Virginia
   claimed that its southern boundary extended to the Pacific; and that its
   northern boundary, starting four hundred miles above, on the Atlantic
   coast, stretched due northwest. To this Paine replies that the charter was
   given to a London company extinct for one hundred and fifty years, during
   which the State had never acted under that charter. Only the heirs of that
   company's members could claim anything under its extinct charter. Further,
   the State unwarrantably assumed that the northwestern line was to extend
   from the northern point of its Atlantic base; whereas there was more
   reason to suppose that it was to extend from the southern point, and meet
   a due west line from the northern point, thus forming a triangular
   territory of forty-five thousand square miles. Moreover, the charter of
   1609 said the lines should stretch "from sea to sea." Paine shows by apt
   quotations that the western sea was supposed to be a short distance from
   the Atlantic, and that the northwestern boundary claimed by Virginia would
   never reach the said sea, "but would form a spiral line of infinite
   windings round the globe, and after passing over the northern parts of
   America and the frozen ocean, and then into the northern parts of Asia,
   would, when eternity should end, and not before, terminate in the north
   pole." Such a territory is nondescript, and a charter that describes
   nothing gives nothing. It may be remarked here that though the
   Attorney-General of Virginia, Edmund Randolph, had to vindicate his
   State's claim, he used a similar argument in defeating Lord Fairfax's
   claim to lands in Virginia which had not been discovered when his grant
   was issued62. All this, however, was mere fencing preliminary to the real
   issue. The western lands, on the extinction of the Virginia companies, had
   reverted to the Crown, and the point in which the State was really
   interested was its succession to the sovereignty of the Crown over all
   that territory. It was an early cropping up of the question of State
   sovereignty. By royal proclamation of 1763 the province of Virginia was
   defined so as not to extend beyond heads of rivers emptying in the
   Atlantic. Paine contended that to the sovereignty of the Crown over all
   territories beyond limits of the thirteen provinces the United States had
   succeeded. This early assertion of the federal doctrine, enforced with
   great historical and legal learning, alienated from Paine some of his best
   Southern friends. The controversy did not end until some years later.
   After the peace, a proposal in the Virginia Legislature to present Paine
   with something for his services, was lost on account of this pamphlet63.

   The students of history will soon be enriched by a "Life of Patrick
   Henry," by his grandson, William Wirt Henry, and a "Life of George
   Mason," by his descendant, Miss Rowland. In these works by competent hands
   important contributions will be made (as I have reason to know) to right
   knowledge of the subject dealt with by Paine in his "Public Good." It can
   here only be touched on; but in passing I may say that Virginia had good
   ground for resisting even the semblance of an assertion of sovereignty by
   a Congress representing only a military treaty between the colonies; and
   that Paine's doctrine confesses itself too idealistic and premature by the
   plea, with which his pamphlet closes, for the summoning of a "continental
   convention, for the purpose of forming a continental constitution,
   defining and describing the powers and authority of Congress." 
    

                                  CHAPTER  XII

                              A JOURNEY TO FRANCE 
                                  [1780-1781]

   THE suggestion of Franklin to Paine, in October, 1775, that he should
   write a history of the events that led up to the conflict, had never been
   forgotten by either. From Franklin he had gathered important facts and
   materials concerning the time antedating his arrival in America, and he
   had been a careful chronicler of the progress of the Revolution. He was
   now eager to begin this work. At the close of the first year of his office
   as Clerk of the Assembly, which left him with means of support for a time,
   he wrote to the Speaker (November 3, 1780) setting forth his intention of
   collecting materials for a history of the Revolution, and saying that he
   could not fulfil the duties of Clerk if re-elected64.

   This and another letter (September 14, 1780), addressed to the Hon. John
   Bayard, Speaker of the late Assembly, were read, and ordered to lie on the
   table. Paine's office would appear to have ended early in November; the
   next three months were devoted to preparations for his history.

   But events determined that Paine should make more history than he was able
   to chronicle. Soon after his Crisis Extraordinary (dated October 6, 1780)
   had appeared, Congress issued its estimate of eight million dollars (a
   million less than Paine's) as the amount to be raised. It was plain that
   the money could not be got in the country, and France must be called on
   for help. Paine drew up a letter to Vergennes, informing him that a paper
   dollar was worth only a cent, that it seemed almost impossible to continue
   the war, and asking that France should supply America with a million
   sterling per annum, as subsidy or loan. This letter was shown to M.
   Marbois, Secretary of the French Legation, who spoke discouragingly. But
   the Hon. Ralph Izard showed the letter to some members of. Congress, whose
   consultation led to the appointment of Col. John Laurens to visit France.
   It was thought that Laurens, one of Washington's aids, would be able to
   explain the military situation. He was reluctant, but agreed to go if
   Paine would accompany him.

   It so happened that Paine had for some months had a dream of crossing the
   Atlantic, with what purpose is shown in the following confidential letter
   (September 9, 1780), probably to Gen. Nathaniel Greene.

   "SIR,

   Last spring I mentioned to you a wish I had to take a passage for Europe,
   and endeavour to go privately to England. You pointed out several
   difficulties in the way, respecting my own safety, which occasioned me to
   defer the matter at that time, in order not only to weigh it more
   seriously, but to submit to the government of subsequent circumstances. I
   have frequently and carefully thought of it since, and were I now to give
   an opinion on it as a measure to which I was not a party, it would be
   this: -- that as the press in that country is free and open, could a
   person possessed of a knowledge of America, and capable of fixing it in
   the minds of the people of England, go suddenly from this country to that,
   and keep himself concealed, he might, were he to manage his knowledge
   rightly, produce a more general disposition for peace than by any method I
   can suppose. I see my way so clearly before me in this opinion, that I
   must be more mistaken than I ever yet was on any political measure, if it
   fail of its end. I take it for granted that the whole country, ministry,
   minority, and all, are tired of the war; but the difficulty is how to get
   rid of it, or how they are to come down from the high ground they have
   taken, and accommodate their feelings to a treaty for peace. Such a change
   must be the effect either of necessity or choice. I think it will take, at
   least, three or four more campaigns to produce the former, and they are
   too wrong in their opinions of America to act from the latter. I imagine
   that next spring will begin with a new Parliament, which is so material a
   crisis in the politics of that country, that it ought to be attended to by
   this; for, should it start wrong, we may look forward to six or seven
   years more of war. The influence of the press rightly managed is
   important; but we can derive no service in this line, because there is no
   person in England who knows enough of America to treat the subject
   properly. It was in a great measure owing to my bringing a knowledge of
   England with me to merica, that I was enabled to enter deeper into
   politics, and with more success, than other people; and whoever takes the
   matter up in England must in like manner be possessed of a knowledge of
   America. I do not suppose that the acknowledgment of Independence is at
   this time a more unpopular doctrine in England than the declaration of it
   was in America immediately before the publication of the pamphlet `Common
   Sense,' and the ground appears as open for the one now as it did for the
   other then.

   "The manner in which I would bring such a publication out would be under
   the cover of an Englishman who had made the tour of America incog. This
   will afford me all the foundation I wish for and enable me to place
   matters before them in a light in which they have never yet viewed them. I
   observe that Mr. Rose in his speech on Governor Pownall's bill, printed in
   Bradford's last paper, says that `to form an opinion on the propriety of
   yielding independence to America requires an accurate knowledge of the
   state of that country, the temper of the people, the resources of their
   Government,' &c. Now there is no other method to give this information a
   national currency but this, -- the channel of the press, which I have ever
   considered the tongue of the world, and which governs the sentiments of
   mankind more than anything else that ever did or can exist.

   "The simple point I mean to aim at is, to make the acknowledgment of
   Independence a popular subject, and that not by exposing and attacking
   their errors, but by stating its advantages and apologising for their
   errors, by way of accomodating the measure to their pride. The present
   parties in that country will never bring one another to reason. They are
   heated with all the passion of opposition, and to rout the ministry, or to
   support them, makes their capital point. Were the same channel open to the
   ministry in this country which is open to us in that, they would stick at
   no expense to improve the opportunity. Men who are used to government know
   the weight and worth of the press, when in hands which can use it to
   advantage. Perhaps with me a little degree of literary pride is connected
   with principle; for, as I had a considerable share in promoting the
   declaration of Independence in this country, I likewise wish to be a means
   of promoting the acknowledgment of it in that; and were I not persuaded
   that the measure I have proposed would be productive of much essential
   service, I would not hazard my own safety, as I have everything to
   apprehend should I fall into their hands; but, could I escape in safety,
   till I could get out a publication in England, my apprehensions would be
   over, because the manner in which I mean to treat the subject would
   procure me protection.

   "Having said thus much on the matter, I take the liberty of hinting to you
   a mode by which the expense may be defrayed without any new charge. Drop a
   delegate in Congress at the next election, and apply the pay to defray
   what I have proposed; and the point then will be, whether you can possibly
   put any man into Congress who could render as much service in that station
   as in the one I have pointed out. When you have perused this, I should be
   glad of some conversation upon it, and will wait on you for that purpose
   at any hour you may appoint. I have hanged my lodgings, and am now in
   Front Street opposite the Coffee House, next door to Aitkin's bookstore.

   "I am, Sir, your ob't humble servant, 

   "THOMAS  PAINE."
   The invitation of Colonel Laurens was eagerly accepted by Paine, who hoped
   that after their business was transacted in France he might fulfil his
   plan of a literary descent on England. They sailed from Boston early in
   February, 1781, and arrived at L'Orient in March.

   Young Laurens came near ruining the scheme by an imprudent advocacy, of
   which Vergennes complained, while ascribing it to his experience.
   According to Lamartine, the King "loaded Paine with favors." The gift of
   six millions was "confided into the hands of Franklin and Paine." The
   author now revealed to Laurens, and no doubt to Franklin, his plan for
   going to England, but was dissuaded from it. From Brest, May 28th, he
   writes to Franklin in Paris:
    

   "I have just a moment to spare to bid you farewell. We go on board in an
   hour or two, with a fair wind and every thing ready. I understand that you
   have expressed a desire to withdraw from business, and I beg leave to
   assure you that every wish of mine, so far as it can be attended with any
   service, will be employed to make your resignation, should it be accepted,
   attended with every possible mark of honor which your long services and
   high character n life justly merit."65
   They sailed from Brest on the French frigate Resolve June 1st, reaching
   Boston August 25th, with 2,500,000 livres in silver, and in convoy a ship
   laden with clothing and military stores.

   The glad tidings had long before reached Washington, then at New Windsor.
   On May 14, 1781, the General writes to Philip Schuyler: 

   "I have been exceedingly distressed by the repeated accounts I have
   received of the sufferings of the troops on the frontier, and the terrible
   consequences which must ensue unless they were speedily supplied. What
   gave a particular poignancy to the sting I felt on the occasion was my
   inability to afford relief.
   On May 26th his diary notes a letter from Laurens reporting the relief
   coming from France. The information was confided by Washington only to his
   diary, lest it should forestall efforts of self-help. Of course Washington
   knew that the starting of convoys from France could not escape English
   vigilance, and that their arrival was uncertain; so he passed near three
   months in preparations, reconnoitering, discussions. By menacing the
   British in New York he made them draw away some of the forces of
   Cornwallis from Virginia, where he meant to strike; but his delay in
   marching south brought on him complaints from Governor Jefferson, Richard
   Henry Lee, and others, who did not know the secret of that delay.
   Washington meant to carry to Virginia an army well-clad, with hard money
   in their pockets, and this he did. The arrival of the French supplies at
   Boston, August 25th, was quickly heralded, and while sixteen ox-teams were
   carrying them to Philadelphia, Washington was there getting, on their
   credit, all the money and supplies he wanted for the campaign that
   resulted in the surrender of Cornwallis.

   For this great service Paine never received any payment or acknowledgment.
   The plan of obtaining aid from France was conceived by him, and mainly
   executed by him. It was at a great risk that he went on this expedition;
   had he been captured he could have hoped for little mercy from the
   British. Laurens, who had nearly upset the business, got the glory and the
   pay; Paine, who had given up his clerkship of the Assembly, run the
   greater danger, and done the real work, got nothing. But it was a role he
   was used to. The young Colonel hastened to resume his place in
   Washington's family, but seems to have given little attention to Paine's
   needs, while asking attention to his own. so it would appear by the
   following friendly letter of Paine, addressed to: 

   "Col. Laurens, Head Quarters, Virginia

   "PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 4, 1781.

   "DEAR SIR,

   "I received your favor (by the post,) dated Sep. 9th, Head of Elk,
   respecting a mislaid letter. A gentleman who saw you at that place about
   the same time told me he had likewise a letter from you to me which he had
   lost, and that you mentioned something to him respecting baggage. This
   left me in a difficulty to judge whether after writing to me by post, you
   had not found the letter you wrote about, and took that opportunity to
   inform me about it. However, I have wrote to Gen. Heath in case the trunk
   should be there, and inclosed in it a letter to Blodget in case it should
   not. I have yet heard nothing from either. I have preferred forwarding the
   trunk, in case it can be done in a reasonable time, to the opening it, and
   if it cannot, then to open it agreeably to your directions, tho' I have no
   idea of its being there.

   "I went for your boots, the next day after you left town, but they were
   not done, and I directed the man to bring them to me as soon as finished,
   but have since seen nothing of him, neither do wish him to bring them just
   now, as I must be obliged to borrow the money to pay for them; but I
   imagine somebody else has taken them off his hands. I expect Col. Morgan
   in town on Saturday, who has some money of mine in his hands, and then
   shall renew my application to the bootmaker.

   "I wish you had thought of me a little before you went away, and at least
   endeavored to put matters in a train that I might not have to
   re-experience what has already past. The gentleman who conveys this to
   you, Mr. Burke, is an assistant judge of South Carolina, and one to whose
   friendship I am much indebted. He lodged some time in the house with me.

   "I enclose you the paper of this morning, by which you will see that
   Gillam had not sailed (or at least I conclude so) on the 4th of July, as
   Major Jackson was deputy toast master, or Burgos-master, or something, at
   an entertainment on that day. As soon as I can learn anything concerning
   Gillam I will inform you of it.

   "I am with every wish for your happiness and success, &c.

   "Please to present my Compts. and best wishes to the General. I have wrote
   to the Marquis and put all my politics into his letter. A paper with
   Rivington's account of the action is enclosed in the Marquis' letter."66
   It will be seen by the following letter to Franklin's nephew that Paine
   was now on good terms with the Congressmen who had opposed him in the
   Deane matter. The letter (in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania) is
   addressed to "Mr. Jonathan Williams, Merchant, Nantz," per "Brig Betsey." 

   "PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 26, 1781.

   "DEAR SIR,

   "Since my arrival I have received a letter from you dated Passy May 18,
   and directed to me at Brest. I intended writing to you by Mr. Baseley who
   is consul at L'Orient but neglected it till it was too late. -- Mem: I
   desired Baseley to mention to you that Mr. Butler of S. Carolina is
   surprised at Capt Rob___n's drawing on him for money; this Mr. Butler
   mentioned to me, and as a friend I communicate it to you. -- I sent you
   Col. Laurens's draft on Madam Babut (I think that is her name) at Nantz
   for 12 L' d'ors for the expence of the journey but have never learned if
   you received it.

   "Your former friend Silas Deane has run his last length. In France he is
   reprobating America, and in America (by letters) he is reprobating France,
   and advising her to abandon her alliance, relinquish her independence, and
   once more become subject to Britain. A number of letters, signed Silas
   Deane, have been published in the New York papers to this effect: they are
   believed, by those who formerly were his friends, to be genuine; Mr. Robt.
   Morris assured me that he had been totally deceived in Deane, but that he
   now looked upon him to be a bad man, and his reputation totally ruined.
   Gouverneur Morris hopped round upon one leg, swore they had all been
   duped, himself among the rest, complimented me on my quick sight, -- and
   by Gods says he nothing carries a man through the world like honesty: --
   and my old friend Duer `Sometimes a sloven and sometimes a Beau,' says,
   Deane is a damned artful rascal. However Duer has fairly cleared himself.
   He received a letter from him a considerable time before the appearance of
   these in the New York papers -- which was so contrary to what be expected
   to receive, and of such a traitorous cast, that he communicated it to Mr.
   Luzerne the Minister,

   "Lord Cornwallis with 7247 officers and men are nabbed nicely in the
   Chesapeake, which I presume you have heard already, otherwise I should
   send you the particulars. I think the enemy can hardly hold out another
   campaign. General Greene has performed wonders to the southward, and our
   affairs in all quarters have a good appearance. The French Ministry have
   hit on the right scheme, that of bringing their force and ours to act in
   conjunction against the enemy.

   "The Marquis de la fayette [Lafayette] is on the point of setting out for
   France, but as I am now safely on this side the water again, I believe I
   shall postpone my second journey to France a little longer. -- Lest Doctr.
   Franklin should not have heard of Deane I wish you would write to him, and

   "P. S. Mind, I'll write no more till I hear from you. The French fleet is
   sailed from the Chesapeake, and the British fleet from New York -- and
   since writing the above, a vessel is come up the Delaware, which informs
   that he was chased by two French frigates to the southward of Chesapeake,
   which on their coming up acquainted him that the French fleet was a head
   in chase of a fleet which they supposed to be the British.

   "N. B. The French fleet sailed the 4th of this month, and the British much
   about the same time -- both to the southward."

    

                                 CHAPTER  XIII

                     THE MUZZLED OX TREADING OUT THE GRAIN 
                                  [1781-1783]

   WHILE Washington and Lafayette were in Virginia, preparing for their
   grapple with Cornwallis, Philadelphia was in apprehension of an attack by
   Sir Henry Clinton, for which it was not prepared. It appeared necessary to
   raise for defence a body of men, but the money was wanting. Paine
   (September 20th) proposed to Robert Morris the plan of "empowering the
   tenant to pay into the Treasury one quarter's rent, to be applied as above
   [i. e., the safety of Philadelphia], and in case it should not be
   necessary to use the money when collected, the sums so paid to be
   considered a part of the customary taxes." This drastic measure would
   probably have been adopted had not the cloud cleared away. The winter was
   presently made glorious summer by the sun of Yorktown. Washington was
   received with enthusiasm by Congress on November 28th. In the general
   feasting and joy Paine participated, but with an aching heart. He was an
   unrivalled literary lion; he had to appear on festive occasions; and he
   was without means. Having given his all, -- copyrights, secretaryship,
   clerkship, -- to secure the independence of a nation, he found himself in
   a state of dependence. He fairly pointed the moral of Solomon's fable: By
   his wisdom he had saved the besieged land, yet none remembered that poor
   man, so far as his needs were concerned. If in his confidential letter to
   Washington, given below, Paine seems egotistical, it should be borne in
   mind that his estimate of his services falls short of their appreciation
   by the national leaders. It should not have been left to Paine to call
   attention to his sacrifices for his country's cause, and the want in which
   it had left him. He knew also that plain speaking was necessary with
   Washington. 

   "SECOND STREET, OPPOSITE THE QUAKER MEETINGHOUSE, Nov. 30th, 1781.

   "SIR,

   "As soon as I can suppose you to be a little at leisure from business and
   visits, I shall, with much pleasure, wait on you, to pay you my respects
   and congratulate you on the success you have most deservedly been blest
   with.

   "I hope nothing in the perusal of this letter will add a care to the many
   that employ your mind; but as there is a satisfaction in speaking where
   one can be conceived and understood, I divulge to you the secret of my own
   situation; because I would wish to tell it to somebody, and as I do not
   want to make it public, I may not have a fairer opportunity.

   "It is seven years, this day, since I arrived in America, and tho' I
   consider them as the most honorary time of my life, they have nevertheless
   been the most inconvenient and even distressing. From an anxiety to
   support, as far as laid in my power, the reputation of the Cause of
   America, as well as the Cause itself, I declined the customary profits
   which authors are entitled to, and I have always continued to do so; yet I
   never thought (if I thought at all on the matter,) but that as I dealt
   generously and honorably by America, she would deal the same by me. But I
   have experienced the contrary -- and it gives me much concern, not only on
   account of the inconvenience it has occasioned to me, but because it
   unpleasantly lessens my opinion of the character of a country which once
   appeared so fair, and it hurts my mind to see her so cold and inattentive
   to matters which affect her reputation,

   "Almost everybody knows, not only in this country but in Europe, that I
   have been of service to her, and as far as the interest of the heart could
   carry a man I have shared with her in the worst of her fortunes, yet so
   confined has been my private circumstances that for one summer I was
   obliged to hire myself as a common clerk to Owen Biddle of this city for
   my support: but this and many others of the like nature I have always
   endeavored to conceal, because to expose them would only serve to entail
   on her the reproach of being ungrateful, and might start an ill opinion of
   her honor and generosity in other countries, especially as there are pens
   enough abroad to spread and aggravate it.

   "Unfortunately for me, I knew the situation of Silas Deane when no other
   person knew it, and with an honesty, for which I ought to have been
   thanked, endeavored to prevent his fraud taking place. He has himself
   proved my opinion right, and the warmest of his advocates now very
   candidly acknowledge their deception.

   "While it was everybody's fate to suffer I cheerfully suffered with them,
   but tho' the object of the country is now nearly established and her
   circumstances rising into prosperity, I feel myself left in a very
   unpleasant situation. Yet I am totally at a loss what to attribute it to;
   for wherever I go I find respect, and everybody I meet treats me with
   friendship; all join in censuring the neglect and throwing blame on each
   other, so that their civility disarms me as much as their conduct
   distresses me. But in this situation I cannot go on, and as I have no
   inclination to differ with the Country or to tell the story of her
   neglect, it is my design to get to Europe, either to France or Holland. I
   have literary fame, and I am sure I cannot experience worse fortune than I
   have here. Besides a person who understood the affairs of America, and was
   capable and disposed to do her a kindness, might render her considerable
   service in Europe, where her situation is but imperfectly understood and
   much misrepresented by the publications which have appeared on that side
   the water, and tho' she has not behaved to me with any proportionate
   return of friendship, my wish for her prosperity is no ways abated, and I
   shall be very happy to see her character as fair as her cause.

   "Yet after all there is something peculiarly hard that the country which
   ought to have been to me a home has scarcely afforded me an asylum.

   "In thus speaking to your Excellency, I know I disclose myself to one who
   can sympathize with me, for I have often cast a thought at your difficult
   situation to smooth over the unpleasantness of my own.

   "I have began some remarks on the Abbe Raynal's `History of the
   Revolution,'    In several places he is mistaken, and in others
   injudicious and sometimes cynical. I believe I shall publish it in
   America, but my principal view is to republish it in Europe both in French
   and English.

   "Please, Sir, to make my respectful compts. to your Lady, and accept to
   yourself the best wishes of,

   Your obedt. humble servant, 

   "THOMAS  PAINE67.

   "His Excellency General WASHINGTON."
   Paine's determination to make no money by his early pamphlets arose partly
   from his religious and Quaker sentiments. He could not have entered into
   any war that did not appear to him sacred, and in such a cause his
   "testimony" could not be that of a "hireling." His "Common Sense," his
   first Crisis, were inspirations, and during all the time of danger his pen
   was consecrated to the cause. He had, however, strict and definite ideas
   of copyright, and was the first to call attention of the country to its
   necessity, and even to international justice in literary property. In the
   chaotic condition of such matters his own sacrifices for the national
   benefit had been to some extent defeated by the rapacity of his first
   publisher, Bell, who pocketed much of what Paine had intended for the
   nation. After he had left Bell for Bradford, the former not only published
   another edition of "Common Sense," but with "large additions," as if from
   Paine's pen. When the perils of the cause seemed past Paine still desired
   to continue his literary record clear of any possible charge of payment,
   but he believed that the country would appreciate this sensitiveness, and,
   while everybody was claiming something for services, would take care that
   he did not starve. In this he was mistaken. In that very winter, after he
   had ventured across the Atlantic and helped to obtain the six million
   livres, he suffered want. Washington appears to have been the first to
   consider his case. In the diary of Robert Morris, Superintendent of
   Finance, there is an entry of January 26,.1782, in which he mentions that
   Washington had twice expressed to him a desire that some provision should
   be made for Paine68. Morris sent for Paine and, in the course of a long
   conversation, expressed a wish that the author's pen should continue its
   services to the country; adding that though he had no position to offer
   him something might turn up. In February Morris mentions further
   interviews with Paine, in which his assistant, Gouverneur Morris, united;
   they expressed their high appreciation of his services to the country, and
   their desire to have the aid of his pen in promoting measures necessary to
   draw out the resources of the country for the completion of its purpose.
   They strongly disclaimed any private or partial ends, or a wish to bind
   his pen to any particular plans. They proposed that he should be paid
   eight hundred dollars per annum from some national fund. Paine having
   consented, Robert Morris wrote to Robert R. Livingston on the subject, and
   the result was a meeting of these two with Washington, at which the
   following was framed: 

   "PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 10, 1782.

   The subscribers, taking into consideration the important situation of
   affairs at the present moment, and the propriety and even necessity of
   informing the people and rousing them into action; considering also the
   abilities of Mr. Thomas Paine as a writer, and that he has been of
   considerable utility to the common cause by several of his publications:
   They are agreed that it will be much for the interest of the United States
   that Mr. Paine be engaged in their service for the purpose above
   mentioned. They are therefore agreed that Mr. Paine be offered a salary of
   $800 per annum, and that the same be paid him by the Secretary of Foreign
   Affairs. The salary to commence from this day, and to be paid by the
   Secretary of Foreign Affairs out of monies to be allowed by the
   Superintendent of Finance for secret services. The subscribers being of
   opinion that a salary publicly and avowedly given for the above purpose
   would injure the effect of Mr. Paine's publications, and subject him to
   injurious personal reflections. 

   "ROBT,  MORRIS.
   "ROBT. LIVINGSTON.,
   "Go. WASHINGTON."
   Before this joint note was written, Paine's pen had been resumed. March
   5th is the date of an extended pamphlet, that must long have been in hand.
   It is introduced by some comments on the King's speech, which concludes
   with a quotation of Smollett's fearful description of the massacres and
   rapine which followed the defeat of the Stuarts at Culloden in 1746. This,
   a memory from Paine's boyhood at Thetford, was an effective comment on the
   King's expression of his desire "to restore the public tranquillity,"
   though poor George III., who was born in the same year as Paine, would
   hardly have countenanced such vengeance. He then deals no doubt after
   consultation with Robert Morris, Superintendent of Finance -- with the
   whole subject of finance and taxation, in the course of which he sounds a
   brave note for a more perfect union of the States, which must be the
   foundation-stone of their independence. As Paine was the first to raise
   the flag of republican independence he was the first to raise that of a
   Union which, above the States, should inherit the supremacy wrested from
   the Crown. These passages bear witness by their nicety to the writer's
   consciousness that he was touching a sensitive subject. The States were
   jealous of their "sovereignty," and he could only delicately intimate the
   necessity of surrendering it. But he manages to say that "each state with
   a small s) is to the United States what each individual is to the state he
   lives in. And it is on this grand point, this movement, upon one centre,
   that our existence as a nation, our happiness as a people, and our safety
   as individuals, depend." He also strikes the federal keynote by saying:
   "The United States will become heir to an extensive quantity of vacant
   land" -- the doctrine of national inheritance which cost him dear.

   Before the Declaration, Paine minted the phrases "Free and Independent
   States of America," and "The Glorious Union." In his second Crisis, dated
   January 13, 1777, he says to Lord Howe: "The UNITED STATES of AMERICA will
   sound as pompously in the world or in history as `the kingdom of Great
   Britain.'"

   The friendliness of Robert Morris to the author is creditable to him. In
   the Deane controversy, Paine had censured him and other members of
   Congress for utilizing that agent of the United States to transact their
   commercial business in Europe. Morris frankly stated the facts, and,
   though his letter showed irritation, he realized that Paine was no
   respecter of persons where the American cause was concerned69. In 1782 the
   Revolution required nicest steering. With the port in sight, the people
   were prone to forget that it is on the coast that dangerous rocks are to
   be found. Since the surrender of Cornwallis they were over-confident, and
   therein likely to play into the hands of the enemy, which had lost
   confidence in its power to conquer the States by arms. England was now
   making efforts to detach America and France from each other by large
   inducements. In France Paine was shown by Franklin and Vergennes the
   overtures that had been made, and told the secret history of the offers of
   mediation from Russia and Austria. With these delicate matters he resolved
   to deal, but before using the documents in his possession consulted
   Washington and Morris. This, I suppose, was the matter alluded to in a
   note of March 17, 1782, to Washington, then in Philadelphia: 

   "You will do me a great deal of pleasure if you can make it convenient to
   yourself to spend a part of an evening at my apartments, and eat a few
   oysters or a crust of bread and cheese; for besides the favour you will do
   me, I want much to consult with you on a matter of public business, tho'
   of a secret nature, which I have already mentioned to Mr. Morris, whom I
   likewise intend to ask, as soon as yourself shall please to mention the
   evening when."
   A similar note was written to Robert Morris four days before. No doubt
   after due consultation the next Crisis, dated May 22, 1782, appeared. It
   dealt with the duties of the alliance: 

   "General Conway," he says, "who made the motion in the British Parliament
   for discontinuing offensive war in America, is a gentleman of an amiable
   character. We have no personal quarrel with him. But he feels not as we
   feel; he is not in our situation, and that alone without any other
   explanation is enough. The British parliament suppose they have many
   friends in America, and that, when all chance of conquest is over, they
   will be able to draw her from her alliance with France. Now if I have any
   conception of the human heart, they will fail in this more than in
   anything that they have yet tried. This part of the business is not a
   question of policy only, but of honor and honesty."
   Paine's next production was a public letter to Sir Guy Carleton,
   commanding in New York, concerning a matter which gave Washington much
   anxiety. On April 12th Captain Huddy had been hanged by a band of
   "refugees," who had sallied from New York into New Jersey (April 12th).
   The crime was traced to one Captain Lippencott, and, after full
   consultation with his officers, Washington demanded the murderer.
   Satisfaction not being given, Washington and his generals determined on
   retaliation, and Colonel Hazen, who had prisoners under guard at
   Lancaster, was directed to have an officer of Captain Huddy's rank chosen
   by lot to suffer death. Hazen included the officers who had capitulated
   with Cornwallis, though they were expressly relieved from liability to
   reprisals (Article 14). The lot fell upon one of these, young Captain
   Asgill (May 27th). It sufficiently proves the formidable character of the
   excitement Huddy's death had caused in the army that Washington did not at
   once send Asgill back. The fact that he was one of the capitulation
   officers was not known outside the military circle. Of this circumstance
   Paine seems ignorant when he wrote his letter to Sir Guy Carleton, in
   which he expresses profound sympathy with Captain Huddy, and warns
   Carleton that by giving sanctuary to the murderer he becomes the real
   executioner of the innocent youth. Washington was resolved to hang this
   innocent man, and, distressing as the confession is, no general appears to
   have warned him of the wrong he was about to commit70. But Paine, with
   well-weighed words, gently withstood the commander, prudently ignoring the
   legal point, if aware of it, 

   "For my own part, I am fully persuaded that a suspension of his fate,
   still holding it in terrorem, will operate on a greater quantity of their
   passions and vices, and restrain them more, than his execution would do.
   However, the change of measures which seems now to be taking place, gives
   somewhat of a new cast to former designs; and if the case, without the
   execution, can be so managed as to answer all the purposes of the last, it
   will look much better hereafter, when the sensations that now provoke, and
   the circumstances which would justify his exit shall be forgotten,"
   This was written on September 7th, and on the 30th Washington, writing to
   a member of Congress, for the first time intimates a desire that Asgill
   shall be released by that body.

   In October came from Vergennes a letter, inspired by Marie Antoinette, to
   whom Lady Asgill had appealed, in which he reminds Washington that the
   Captain is a prisoner whom the King's arms contributed to surrender into
   his hands. That he had a right, therefore, to intercede for his life. This
   letter (of July 29, 1782) was laid before Congress, which at once set
   Asgill at liberty. Washington was relieved, and wrote the Captain a
   handsome congratulation.

   Although Paine could never find the interval of leisure necessary to write
   consecutively his "History of the Revolution," it is to a large extent
   distributed through his writings. From these and his letters a true
   history of that seven years can be gathered, apart from the details of
   battles; and even as regards these his contributions are of high
   importance, notably as regards the retreat across the Delaware, the
   affairs at Trenton and Princeton, and the skirmishes near Philadelphia
   following the British occupation of that city. The latter are vividly
   described in his letter to Franklin, and the former in his review of the
   Abbe Raynal.

   In his letter to Washington, of November 30, 1781, Paine mentioned that he
   had begun "some remarks" on the Abbe's work "On the Revolution of the
   English Colonies in North America." It was published early in September,
   1782. The chief interest of the pamphlet, apart from the passages
   concerning the military events of 1776, lies in its reflections of events
   in the nine months during which the paper lingered on his table. In those
   months he wrote four numbers of the Crisis, one of urgent importance on
   the financial situation. The review of the Abbe's history was evidently
   written at intervals. As a literary production it is artistic. With the
   courtliness of one engaged in "an affair of honor," he shakes the Abbe's
   hand, sympathizes with his misfortune in having his manuscript stolen, and
   thus denied opportunity to revise the errors for which he must be called
   to account. His main reason for challenging the historian is an allegation
   that the Revolution originated in the question "whether the mother country
   had, or had not, a right to lay, directly or indirectly, a slight tax upon
   the colonies." The quantity of the tax had nothing to do with it. The tax
   on tea was a British experiment to test its declaratory Act affirming the
   right of Parliament "to bind America in all cases whatever," and that
   claim was resisted in the first stage of its execution. Secondly, the Abbe
   suffers for having described the affair at Trenton as accidental. Paine's
   answer is an admirable piece of history. Thirdly, the Abbe suggests that
   the Americans would probably have accommodated their differences with
   England when commissioners visited them in April, 1778, but for their
   alliance with France. Paine affirms that Congress had rejected the English
   proposals (afterwards brought by the commissioners) on April 22d, eleven
   days before news arrived of the French alliance71. The Abbe is
   metaphysically punished for assuming that a French monarchy in aiding
   defenders of liberty could have no such motive as "the happiness of
   mankind." Not having access to the archives of France, Paine was able to
   endow Vergennes with the enthusiasm of Lafayette, and to see in the
   alliance a new dawning era of international affection. All such alliances
   are republican. The Abbe is leniently dealt with for his clear plagiarisms
   from Paine, and then left for a lecture to England. That country is
   advised to form friendship with France and Spain; to expand its mind
   beyond its island, and improve its manners. This is the refrain of a
   previous passage. 

   "If we take a review of what part Britain has acted we shall find
   everything which should make a nation blush. The most vulgar abuse,
   accompanied by that species of haughtiness which distinguishes the hero of
   a mob from the character of. a gentleman; it was equally as much from her
   manners as her injustice that she lost the colonies. By the latter she
   provoked their principle, by the former she wore out their temper; and it
   ought to be held out as an example to the world, to show how necessary it
   is to conduct the business of government with civility."
   The close of this essay, written with peace in the air, contains some
   friendly advice to England. She is especially warned to abandon Canada,
   which, after loss of the thirteen colonies, will be a constant charge.
   Canada can never be populous, and of all that is done for it "Britain will
   sustain the expense, and America reap the advantage."

   In a letter dated "Bordentown, September 7, 1782," Paine says to
   Washington: 

   "I have the honour of presenting you with fifty copies of my Letter to the
   Abbe Raynal, for the use of the army, and to repeat to you my
   acknowledgments for your friendship.

   "I fully believe we have seen our worst days over. The spirit of the war,
   on the part of the enemy, is certainly on the decline full as much as we
   think. I draw this opinion not only from the present promising appearance
   of things, and the difficulties we know the British Cabinet is in; but I
   add to it the peculiar effect which certain periods of time have, more or
   less, on all men. The British have accustomed themselves to think of seven
   years in a manner different to other portions of time. They acquire this
   partly by habit, by reason, by religion, and by superstition. They serve
   seven years' apprenticeship -- they elect their parliament for seven years
   -- they punish by seven years' transportation, or the duplicate or
   triplicate of that term -- they let their leases in the same manner, and
   they read that Jacob served seven years for one wife, and after that seven
   years for another; and the same term likewise extinguishes all obligations
   (in certain cases) of debt, or matrimony: and thus this particular period
   of time, by a variety of concurrences, has obtained an influence on their
   mind. They have now had seven years of war, and are no farther on the
   Continent than when they began. The superstitious and populous part will
   therefore conclude that it is not to be, and the rational part of them
   will think they have tried an unsuccessful and expensive experiment long
   enough, and that it is in vain to try it any longer, and by these two
   joining in the same eventual opinion the obstinate part among them will be
   beaten out, unless, consistent with their former sagacity, they get over
   the matter at once by passing a new declaratory Act to bind Time in all
   cases whatsoever, or declare him a rebel."
   The rest of this letter is the cautious and respectful warning against the
   proposed execution of Captain Asgill, quoted elsewhere. Washington's
   answer is cheerful, and its complimentary close exceptionally cordial. 

   HEAD-QUARTERS, VERPLANK'S POINT, 18 September, 1782.

   SIR,

   I have the pleasure to acknowledge your favor, informing me of your
   roposal to present me with fifty copies of your last publication for the
   amusement of the army. For this intention you have my sincere thanks, not
   only on my own account, but for the pleasure, which I doubt not the
   gentlemen of the army will receive from the perusal of your pamphlets.
   Your observations on the period of seven years, as it applies itself to
   and affects British minds, are ingenious, and I wish it may not fail of
   its effects in the present instance. The measures and the policy of the
   enemy are at present in great perplexity and embarrassment -- but I have
   my fears, whether their necessities (which are the only operating motives
   with them) are yet arrived to that point, which must drive them
   unavoidably into what they will esteem disagreeable and dishonorable terms
   of peace, -- such, for instance, as an absolute, unequivocal admission of
   American Independence, upon the terms on which she can accept it. For this
   reason, added to the obstinacy of the King, and the probable consonant
   principles of some of the principal ministers, I have not so full a
   confidence in the success of the present negociation for peace as some
   gentlemen entertain. Should events prove my jealousies to be ill founded,
   I shall make myself happy under the mistake, consoling myself with the
   idea of having erred on the safest side, and enjoying with as much
   satisfaction as any of my countrymen the pleasing issue of our severe
   contest.

   "The case of Captain Asgill has indeed been spun out to a great length --
   but, with you, I hope that its termination will not be unfavourable to
   this country.

   "I am, sir, with great esteem and regard,

   "Your most obedient servant, 

   "G. WASHINGTON."
   A copy of the answer to the Abbe Raynal was sent by Paine to Lord
   Shelburne, and with it in manuscript his newest Crisis, dated October 29,
   1782. This was suggested by his lordship's speech of July 10th, in which
   he was reported to have said: "The independence of America would be the
   ruin of England." "Was America then," asks Paine, "the giant of empire,
   and England only her dwarf in waiting? Is the case so strangely altered,
   that those who once thought we could not live without them are now brought
   to declare that they cannot exist without us?"

   Paine's prediction that it would be a seven years' war was nearly true.
   There was indeed a dismal eighth year, the army not being able to disband
   until the enemy had entirely left the country, -- a year when peace seemed
   to "break out" like another war. The army, no longer uplifted by ardors of
   conflict with a foreign foe, became conscious of its hunger, its
   nakedness, and the prospect of returning in rags to pauperized homes. They
   saw all the civil officers of the country paid, while those who had
   defended them were unpaid; and the only explanations that could be offered
   -- the inability of Congress, and incoherence of the States -- formed a
   new peril. The only hope of meeting an emergency fast becoming acute, was
   the unanimous adoption by the States of the proposal of Congress for a
   five-per-cent. duty on imported articles, the money to be applied to the
   payment of interest on loans to be made in Holland. Several of the States
   had been dilatory in their consent, but Rhode Island absolutely refused,
   and Paine undertook to reason with that State. In the Providence
   Gazette, December 21st, appeared the following note, dated: 

   "PHILADELPHIA, November 27, 1782 "

   "SIR,

   "Inclosed I send you a Philadelphia paper of this day's date, and desire
   you to insert the piece signed `A Friend to Rhode Island and the Union,' I
   am concerned that Rhode Island should make it necessary to address a piece
   to her, on a subject which the rest of the States are agreed in.

   Yours &c. 

   "THOMAS  PAINE."
   The insertion of Paine's letter led to a fierce controversy, the immediate
   subject of which is hardly of sufficient importance to detain us long72.

   Yet this controversy, which presently carried Paine to Providence, where
   he wrote and published six letters, raised into general discussion the
   essential principles of Union. Rhode Island's jealousy of its
   "sovereignty" -- in the inverse ratio of its size, -- made it the last to
   enter a Union which gave it equal legislative power with the greatest
   States; it need not be wondered then that at this earlier period, when
   sovereignty and self-interest combined, our pioneer of nationality had to
   undergo some martyrdom. "What," he asked, "would the sovereignity of any
   individual state be, if left to itself to contend with a foreign power?  
   It is on our united sovereignty that our greatness and safety, and the
   security of our foreign commerce, rest. This united sovereignty then must
   be something more than a name, and requires to be as completely organized
   for the line it is to act in as that of any individual state, and, if
   anything, more so, because more depends on it." He received abuse, and
   such ridicule as this (February 1st): 

   "In the Name of Common Sense, Amen, I, Thomas Paine, having according to
   appointment, proceeded with all convenient speed to answer the objections
   to the five per cent, by endeavouring to cover the design and blind the
   subject, before I left Philadelphia, and having proceeded to a convenient
   place of action in the State of Rhode Island, and there republished my
   first letter," etc.
   In the same paper with this appeared a letter of self-defence from Paine,
   who speaks of the personal civility extended to him in Rhode Island, but
   of proposals to stop his publications. He quotes a letter of friendship
   from Colonel Laurens, who gave him his war-horse, and an equally cordial
   one from General Nathaniel Greene, Rhode Island's darling hero, declaring
   that he should be rewarded for his public services.

   This visit to Rhode Island was the last work which Paine did in pursuance
   of his engagement, which ended with the resignation of Morris in January.
   Probably Paine received under it one year's salary, $800 -- certainly no
   more. I think that during the time he kept his usual signature, "Common
   Sense," sacred to his individual "testimonies."

   On his return to Philadelphia Paine wrote a memorial to Chancellor
   Livingston, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Robert Morris, Minister of
   Finance, and his assistant Gouverneur Morris, urging the necessity of
   adding "a Continental Legislature to Congress, to be elected by the
   several States." Robert Morris invited the Chancellor and a number of
   eminent men to meet Paine at dinner, where his plea for a stronger union
   was discussed and approved. This was probably the earliest of a series of
   consultations preliminary to the constitutional Convention.

   The newspaper combat in Rhode Island, which excited general attention, and
   the continued postponement of all prospect of paying the soldiers, had a
   formidable effect on the army. The anti-republican elements of the
   country, after efforts to seduce Washington, attempted to act without him.
   In confronting the incendiary efforts of certain officers at Newburg to
   turn the army of liberty into mutineers against it, Washington is seen
   winning his noblest victory after the revolution had ended. He not only
   subdued the reactionary intrigues, but the supineness of the country,
   which had left its soldiers in a condition that played into the
   intriguers' hands.

   On April 18th Washington formally announced the cessation of hostilities.
   On April 19th -- eighth anniversary of the collision at Lexington -- Paine
   printed the little pamphlet entitled "Thoughts on Peace and the Probable
   Advantages Thereof," included in his works as the last Crisis. It opens
   with the words: "The times that tried men's souls are over -- and the
   greatest and completest revolution the world ever knew, gloriously and
   happily accomplished." He again, as in his first pamphlet, pleads for a
   supreme nationality, absorbing all cherished sovereignties. This is
   Paine's "farewell address."

   "It was the cause of America that made me an author. The force with which
   it struck my mind, and the dangerous condition in which the country was
   in, by courting an impossible and an unnatural reconciliation with those
   who were determined to reduce her, instead of striking out into the only
   line that could save her, a Declaration of Independence, made it
   impossible for me, feeling as I did, to be silent; and if, in the course
   of more than seven years, I have rendered her any service, I have likewise
   added something to the reputation of literature, by freely and
   disinterestedly employing it in the great cause of mankind . . . . But as
   the scenes of war are closed, and every man preparing for home and happier
   times, I therefore take leave of the subject. I have most sincerely
   followed it from beginning to end, and through all its turns and windings;
   and whatever country I may hereafter be in, I shall always feel an honest
   pride at the part I have taken and acted, and a gratitude to nature and
   providence for putting it in my power to be of some use to mankind." 
    

                                  CHAPTER  XIV

                        GREAT WASHINGTON AND POOR PAINE 
                                  [1783-1785]

   THE world held no other man so great and so happy as Washington, in
   September, 1783, -- the month of final peace. Congress, then sitting at
   Princeton, had invited him to consult with them on the arrangements
   necessary for a time of peace, and prepared a mansion for him at Rocky
   Hill. For a time the General gave himself up to hilarity, as ambassadors
   of congratulation gathered from every part of the world. A glimpse of the
   festivities is given by David Howell of Rhode Island in a letter to
   Governor Greene. 

   "The President, with all the present members, chaplains, and great
   officers of Congress, had the honor of dining at the General's table last
   Friday. The tables were spread under a marquise or tent taken from the
   British. The repast was elegant, but the General's company crowned the
   whole. As I had the good fortune to be seated facing the General, I had
   the pleasure of hearing all his conversation. The President of Congress
   was seated on his right, and the Minister of France on his left. I
   observed with much pleasure that the General's front was uncommonly open
   and pleasant; the contracted, pensive phiz betokening deep thought and
   much care, which I noticed at Prospect Hill in 1775, is done away, and a
   pleasant smile and sparkling vivacity of wit and humor succeeds. On the
   President observing that in the present situation of our affairs he
   believed that Mr. [Robert] Morris had his hands full, the General replied
   at the same instant, `he wished he had his pockets full too.' On Mr.
   Peters observing that the man who made these cups (for we drank wine out
   of silver cups) was turned a Quaker preacher, the General replied that `he
   wished he had turned a Quaker preacher before he made the cups.'   You
   must also hear the French Minister's remark on the General's humor -- 'You
   tink de penitence wou'd have been good for de cups.' Congress has ordered
   an Egyptian statue of General Washington, to be erected at the place where
   they may establish their permanent residence. No honors short of those
   which the Deity vindicates to himself can be too great for Gen.
   Washington."
   At this time Paine sat in his little home in Bordentown, living on his
   crust. He had put most of his savings in this house (on two tenths of an
   acre) so as to be near his friend Col. Joseph Kirkbride. The Colonel was
   also of Quaker origin, and a hearty sympathizer with Paine's principles.
   They had together helped to frame the democratic Constitution of
   Pennsylvania (1776), had fought side by side, and both had scientific
   tastes. Since the burning of his house, Bellevue (Bucks), Colonel
   Kirkbride had moved to Bordentown, N. J., and lived at Hill Top, now part
   of a female college.

   A part of Paine's house also stands. At Bordentown also resided Mr. Hall,
   who had much mechanical skill, and whom he had found eager to help him in
   constructing models of his inventions. To such things he now meant to
   devote himself, but before settling down permanently he longed to see his
   aged parents and revisit his English friends. For this, however, he had
   not means. Robert Morris advised Paine to call the attention of Congress
   to various unremunerated services. His secretaryship of the Foreign
   Affairs Committee, terminated by an admitted injustice to him, had been
   burdensome and virtually unpaid; its nominal $70 per month was really
   about $15. His perilous journey to France, with young Laurens, after the
   millions that wrought wonders, had not brought him even a paper dollar.
   Paine, therefore, on June 7th, wrote to Elias Boudinot, President of
   Congress, stating that though for his services he had "neither sought,
   received, nor stipulated any honors, advantages, or emoluments," he
   thought Congress should inquire into them. The letter had some effect, but
   meanwhile Paine passed three months of poverty and gloom, and had no part
   in the festivities at Princeton.

   One day a ray from that festive splendor shone in his humble abode. The
   great Commander had not forgotten his unwearied fellow-soldier, and wrote
   him a letter worthy to be engraved on the tombs of both. 

   "ROCKY HILL, Sept. 10, 1783.

   "DEAR SIR,

   "I have learned since I have been at this place, that you are at
   Bordentown. Whether for the sake of retirement or economy, I know not. Be
   it for either, for both, or whatever it may, if you will come to this
   place, and partake with me, I shall be exceedingly happy to see you.

   "Your presence may remind Congress of your past services to this country;
   and if it is in my power to impress them, command my best services with
   freedom, as they will be rendered cheerfully by one who entertains a
   lively sense of the importance of your works, and who, with much pleasure,
   subscribes himself,

   "Your sincere friend, 

   "G. WASHINGTON."
   The following was Paine's reply: 

   "BORDEN TOWN, Sept. 21.

   "SIR,

   "I am made exceedingly happy by the receipt of your friendly letter of the
   10th. instant, which is this moment come to hand; and the young gentleman
   that brought it, a son of Col. Geo. Morgan, waits while I write this. It
   had been sent to Philadelphia, and on my not being there, was returned,
   agreeable to directions on the outside, to Col. Morgan at Princetown, who
   forwarded it to this place.

   "I most sincerely thank you for your good wishes and friendship to me, and
   the kind invitation you have honored me with, which I shall with much
   pleasure accept.

   "On the resignation of Mr. Livingston in the winter and likewise of Mr. R.
   Morris, at [the same] time it was judged proper to discontinue the matter
   which took place when you were in Philadelphia. It was at the same time a
   pleasure to me to find both these gentlemen (to whom I was before that
   time but little known) so warmly disposed to assist in rendering my
   situation permanent, and Mr. Livingston's letter to me, in answer to one
   of mine to him, which I enclose, will serve to show that his friendship to
   me is in concurrence with yours.

   "By the advice of Mr. Morris I presented a letter to Congress expressing a
   request that they would be pleased to direct me to lay before them an
   account of what my services, such as they were, and situation, had been
   during the course of the war. This letter was referred to a committee, and
   their report is now before Congress, and contains, as I am informed, a
   recommendation that I be appointed historiographer to the continent73. I
   have desired some members that the further consideration of it be
   postponed, until I can state to the committee some matters which I wish
   them to be acquainted with, both with regard to myself and the
   appointment. And as it was my intention, so I am now encouraged by your
   friendship to take your confidential advice upon it before I present it.
   For though I never was at a loss in writing on public matters, I feel
   exceedingly so in what respects myself.

   "I am hurt by the neglect of the collective ostensible body of America, in
   a way which it is probable they do not perceive my feelings. It has an
   effect in putting either my reputation or their generosity at stake; for
   it cannot fail of suggesting that either I (notwithstanding the appearance
   of service) have been undeserving their regard or that they are remiss
   towards me. Their silence is to me something like condemnation, and their
   neglect must be justified by my loss of reputation, or my reputation
   supported at their injury; either of which is alike painful to me. But as
   I have ever been dumb on everything which might touch national honor so I
   mean ever to continue so.

   "Wishing you, Sir, the happy enjoyment of peace and every public and
   private felicity I remain &c. 

   "THOMAS  PAINE.

   "Col. Kirkbride at whose house I am, desires me to present you his
   respectful compliments."
   Paine had a happy visit at Washington's headquarters, where he met old
   revolutionary comrades, among them Humphreys, Lincoln, and Cobb. He saw
   Washington set the river on fire on Guy Fawkes Day with a roll of
   cartridge-paper. When American art is more mature we may have a picture of
   war making way for science, illustrated by the night-scene of Washington
   and Paine on a scow, using their cartridge-paper to fire the gas released
   from the river-bed by soldiers with poles!74

   There was a small party in Congress which looked with sullen jealousy on
   Washington's friendliness with Paine. The States, since the conclusion of
   the war, were already withdrawing into their several shells of
   "sovereignty," while Paine was arguing with everybody that there could be
   no sovereignty but that of the United States, -- and even that was merely
   the supremacy of Law. The arguments in favor of the tax imposed by
   Congress, which he had used in Rhode Island, were repeated in his
   last Crisis (April 19th), and it must have been under Washington's roof at
   Rocky Hill that he wrote his letter "To the People of America" (dated
   December 9th), in which a high national doctrine was advocated. This was
   elicited by Lord Sheffield's pamphlet, "Observations on the Commerce of
   the United States," which had been followed by a prohibition of commerce
   with the West Indies in American bottoms. Lord Sheffield had said: "It
   will be a long time before the American States can be brought to act as a
   nation; neither are they to be feared by us as such." Paine calls the
   attention of Rhode Island to this, and says: "America is now sovereign and
   independent, and ought to conduct her affairs in a regular style of
   character." She has a perfect right of commercial retaliation. 

   "But it is only by acting in union that the usurpations of foreign nations
   on the freedom of trade can be counteracted, and security extended to the
   commerce of America. And when we view a flag, which to the eye is
   beautiful, and to contemplate its rise and origin inspires a sensation of
   sublime delight, our national honor must unite with our interest to
   prevent injury to the one or insult to the other."
   Noble as these sentiments now appear, they then excited alarm in certain
   Congressmen, and it required all Washington's influence to secure any
   favorable action in Paine's case. In 1784, however, New York presented
   Paine with "two hundred and seventy-seven acres, more or less, which
   became forfeited to and vested in the People of this State by the
   conviction of Frederick Devoe."75

   With such cheerful prospects, national and personal, Paine rose into song,
   as appears by the following letter ("New York, April 28th") to
   Washington: 

   "DEAR SIR,

   I hope to have in a few days the honor and happiness of seeing you well at
   Philadelphia, I shall not trouble you with a long letter.

   "It was my intention to have followed you on to Philadelphia, but when I
   recollected the friendship you had shewn to me, and the pains you had
   taken to promote my interests, and knew likewise the untoward disposition
   of two or three Members of Congress, I felt an exceeding unwillingness
   that your friendship to me should be put to further tryals, or that you
   should experience the mortification of having your wishes disappointed,
   especially by one to whom delegation is his daily bread.

   "While I was pondering on these matters, Mr. Duane and some other friends
   of yours and mine, who were persuaded that nothing would take place in
   Congress (as a single man when only nine states were present could stop
   the whole), proposed a new line which is to leave it to the States
   individually; and a unanimous resolution has passed the senate of this
   State, which is generally expressive of their opinion and friendship. What
   they have proposed is worth at least a thousand guineas, and other States
   will act as they see proper. If I do but get enough to carry me decently
   thro' the world and independently thro' the History of the Revolution, I
   neither wish nor care for more; and that the States may very easily do if
   they are disposed to it. The State of Pennsylvania might have done it
   alone.

   "I present you with a new song for the Cincinnati; and beg to offer you a
   remark on that subject76. The intention of the name appears to me either
   to be lost or not understood. For it is material to the future freedom of
   the country that the example of the late army retiring to private life, on
   the principles of Cincinnatus, should be commemorated, that in future ages
   it may be imitated. Whether every part of the institution is perfectly
   consistent with a republic is another question, but the precedent ought
   not to be lost.

   "I have not yet heard of any objection in the Assembly of this State, to
   the resolution of the Senate, and I am in hopes there will be none made.
   Should the method succeed, I shall stand perfectly clear of Congress,
   which will be an agreeable circumstance to me; because whatever I may then
   say on the necessity of strengthening the union, and enlarging its powers,
   will come from me with a much better grace than if Congress had made the
   acknowledgment themselves.

   "If you have a convenient opportunity I should be much obliged to you to
   mention this subject to Mr. President Dickinson. I have two reasons for
   it, the one is my own interest and circumstances, the other is on account
   of the State, for what with their parties and contentions, they have acted
   to me with a churlish selfishness, which I wish to conceal unless they
   force it from me.

   "As I see by the papers you are settling a tract of land, I enclose you a
   letter I received from England on the subject of settlements. I think
   lands might be disposed of in that country to advantage.

   I am, dear Sir, &c."
   The estate at New Rochelle had a handsome house on it (once a patrimonial
   mansion of the Jays), and Paine received distinguished welcome when lie
   went to take possession. This he reciprocated, but he did not remain long
   at New Rochelle77. Bordentown had become his home; he had found there a
   congenial circle of friends, proved such during his poverty. He was not,
   indeed, entirely relieved of poverty by the New York honorarium, but he
   had expectation that the other States would follow the example. In a
   letter to Jefferson also Paine explained his reason for desiring that the
   States, rather than Congress, should remunerate him. That Washington
   appreciated this motive appears by letters to Richard Henry Lee and James
   Madison. 

   "MOUNT VERNON, 12 June.

   "Unsollicited by, and unknown to Mr. Paine, I take the liberty of hinting
   the services and the distressed (for so I think it may be called)
   situation of that Gentleman.

   "That his Common Sense, and many of his Crisis, were well timed and had a
   happy effect upon the public mind, none, I believe, who will recur to the
   epocha's at which they were published will deny. -- That his services
   hitherto have passed of[f] unnoticed is obvious to all; and that he is
   chagreened and necessitous I will undertake to aver. -- Does not common
   justice then point to some compensation?

   "He is not in circumstances to refuse the bounty of the public. New York,
   not the least distressed nor most able State in the Union, has set the
   example. He prefers the benevolence of the States individually to an
   allowance from Congress, for reasons which are conclusive in his own mind,
   and such as I think may be approved by others. His views are moderate, a
   decent independency is, I believe, the height of his ambition, and if you
   view his services in the American cause in the same important light that I
   do, I am sure you will have pleasure in obtaining it for him.

   "I am with esteem and regard, Dr. Sir, yr. most obdt. servt., 

   "GEORGE  WASHINGTON.78

   "MOUNT VERNON, June 12.

   DEAR SIR,

   Can nothing be done in our Assembly for poor Paine? Must the merits and
   services of Common Sense continue to glide down the stream of time,
   unrewarded by this country?

   "His writings certainly have had a powerful effect on the public mind, --
   ought they not then to meet an adequate return? He is poor!   he is
   chagreened! and almost if not altogether in despair of relief.

   "New York, it is true, not the least distressed nor best able State in the
   Union, has done something for him. This kind of provision he prefers to an
   allowance from Congress, he has reasons for it, which to him are
   conclusive, and such, I think, as would have weight with others. His views
   are moderate -- a decent independency is, I believe, all he aims at.
   Should he not obtain this? If you think so I am sure you will not only
   move the matter but give it your support. For me it only remains to feel
   for his situation and to assure you of the sincere esteem and regard with
   which I have the honor to be, D Sir,

   "Yr. Most Obedt. Humble Servt., 

   "G. WASHINGTON79.

   "JAMES  MADISON, Esq."
   A similar letter was written to Patrick Henry and perhaps to others. A
   bill introduced into the Virginia Legislature (June 28th) to give Paine a
   tract of land, being lost on the third reading, Madison (June 30th)
   offered a "bill for selling the public land in the county of Northampton,
   called the Secretary's land, and applying part of the money arising
   therefrom to the purchase of a tract to be vested in Thomas Payne and his
   heirs." The result is described by Madison (July 2d) to Washington: 

   "The easy reception it found, induced the friends of the measure to add
   the other moiety to the proposition, which would have raised the market
   value of the donation to about four thousand pounds, or upwards, though it
   would not probably have commanded a rent of more than one hundred pounds
   per annum. In this form the bill passed through two readings. The third
   reading proved that the tide had suddenly changed, for the bill was thrown
   out by a large majority. An attempt was next made to sell the land in
   question, and apply two thousand pounds of the money to the purchase of a
   farm for Mr. Paine. This was lost by a single voice. Whether a greater
   disposition to reward patriotic and distinguished exertions of genius will
   be found on any succeeding occasion, is not for me to predetermine. Should
   it finally appear that the merits of the man, whose writings have so much
   contributed to enforce and foster the spirit of independence in the people
   of America, are unable to inspire them with a just beneficence, the world,
   it is to be feared, will give us as little credit for our policy as for
   gratitude in this particular."
   R. H. Lee -- unfortunately not present, because of illness -- writes
   Washington (July 22d) 

   "I have been told that it miscarried from its being observed that he had
   shown enmity to this State by having written a pamphlet injurious to our
   claim of Western Territory. It has ever appeared to me that this pamphlet
   was the consequence of Mr. Paine's being himself imposed upon, and that it
   was rather the fault of the place than the man."80
   So the news came that Virginia had snubbed Paine, at the moment of voting
   a statue to Washington. But his powerful friend did not relax his efforts,
   and he consulted honest John Dickinson, President of Pennsylvania. Under
   date of November 27th, the following was written by Paine to General
   Irwin, Vice-President of Pennsylvania: 

   "The President has made me acquainted with a Conversation which General
   Washington had with him at their last interview respecting myself, and he
   is desirous that I should communicate to you his wishes, which are, that
   as he stands engaged on the General's request to recommend to the
   Assembly, so far as lies in his power, their taking into consideration the
   part I have acted during the war, that you would join your assistance with
   him in the measure. -- Having thus, Sir, opened the matter to you in
   general terms, I will take an opportunity at some time convenient to
   yourself to state it to you more fully, as there are many parts in it that
   are not publicly known. -- I shall have the pleasure of seeing you at the
   President's to-day to dine and in the mean time I am etc."
   On December 6th the Council sent this message to the General Assembly of
   Pennsylvania: 

   "GENTLEMEN:

   The President having reported in Council a conversation between General
   Washington and himself respecting Mr. Thomas Paine, we have thereby been
   induced to take the services and situation of that gentleman at this time
   into our particular consideration.

   "Arriving in America just before the war broke out, he commenced his
   residence here, and became a citizen of this Commonwealth by taking the
   oath of allegiance at a very early period. So important were his services
   during the late contest, that those persons whose own merits in the course
   of it have been the most distinguished concur with a highly honorable
   unanimity in entertaining sentiments of esteem for him, and interesting
   themselves in his deserts. It is unnecessary for us to enlarge on this
   subject. If the General Assembly shall be pleased to appoint a Committee,
   they will receive information that we doubt not will in every respect
   prove satisfactory.

   "We confide that you will, then, feel the attention of Pennsylvania is
   drawn towards Mr. Paine by motives equally grateful to the human heart,
   and reputable to the Republic; and that you will join with us in the
   opinion that a suitable acknowledgment of his eminent services, and a
   proper provision for the continuance of them in an independent manner,
   should be made on the part of this State."
   Pennsylvania promptly voted to Paine -L-500, -- a snug little fortune in
   those days.

   Paine thus had a happy New Year. Only two States had acted, but they had
   made him independent. Meanwhile Congress also was willing to remunerate
   him, but he had put difficulties in the way. He desired, as we have seen,
   to be independent of that body, and wished it only to pay its debts to
   him; but one of these -- his underpaid secretaryship -- would involve
   overhauling the Paine-Deane case again. Perhaps that was what Paine
   desired; had the matter been passed on again the implied censures of Paine
   on the journal of Congress would have been reversed. When therefore a
   gratuity was spoken of Paine interfered, and wrote to Congress, now
   sitting in New York, asking leave to submit his accounts. This letter was
   referred to a committee (Gerry, Pettit, King). 

   "Mr. Gerry,' says Paine, came to me and said that the Committee had
   consulted on the subject, and they intended to bring in a handsome report,
   but that they thought it best not to take any notice of your letter, or
   make any reference to Deane's affair, or your salary. They will indemnify
   you without it. The case is, there are some motions on the Journals of
   Congress for censuring you, with respect to Deane's affair, which cannot
   now be recalled, because they have been printed. Therefore [we] will bring
   in a report that will supersede them without mentioning the purport of
   your letter."
   On the committee's report Congress resolved (August 26th): 

   "That the early, unsolicited, and continued labors of Mr. Thomas Paine, in
   explaining and enforcing the principles of the late revolution by
   ingenious and timely publications upon the nature of liberty, and civil
   government, have been well received by the citizens of these States, and
   merit the approbation of Congress; and that in consideration of these
   services, and the benefits produced thereby, Mr. Paine is entitled to a
   liberal gratification from the United States."
   This of course was not what Paine wished, and he again (September 27th)
   urged settlement of his accounts. But, on October 3d, Congress ordered the
   Treasurer to pay Paine $3,000, "for the considerations mentioned in the
   resolution of the 26th of August last." "It was," Paine maintained to the
   last, "an indemnity to me for some injustice done me, for Congress had
   acted dishonorably by me." The Committee had proposed $6,000, but the
   author's enemies had managed to reduce it. The sum paid was too small to
   cover Paine's journey to France with Laurens, which was never repaid.

   The services of Thomas Paine to the American cause cannot, at this
   distance of time, be estimated by any records of them, nor by his printed
   works. They are best measured in the value set on them by the great
   leaders most cognizant of them, -- by Washington, Franklin, Jefferson,
   Adams, Madison, Robert Morris, Chancellor Livingston, R. H. Lee, Colonel
   Laurens, General Greene, Dickinson. Had there been anything dishonorable
   or mercenary in Paine's career, these are the men who would have known it;
   but their letters are searched in vain for even the faintest hint of
   anything disparaging to his patriotic self-devotion during those eight
   weary years. Their letters, however, already quoted in these pages, and
   others omitted, show plainly that they believed that all the States owed
   Paine large "returns (as Madison wrote to Washington) of gratitude for
   voluntary services," and that these services were not merely literary.
   Such was the verdict of the men most competent to pass judgment on the
   author, the soldier, the secretary. It can never be reversed.

   To the radical of to-day, however, Paine will seem to have fared pretty
   well for a free lance; and he could now beat all his lances into bridge
   iron, without sparing any for the wolf that had haunted his door.

                                  [1785-1787]

   PAINE was the literary lion in New York -- where Congress sat in 1785 --
   and was especially intimate with the Nicholsons, whose house was the
   social salon of leading republicans81. One may easily read between the
   lines of the following note to Franklin that the writer is having " a good
   time " in New York, where it was written September 23d: 

   "MY DEAR SIR,

   It gives me exceeding great pleasure to have the opportunity of
   congratulating you on your return home, and to a land of Peace; and to
   express to you my heartfelt wishes that the remainder of your days may be
   to you a time of happy ease and rest, Should Fate prolong my life to the
   extent of yours, it would give me the greatest felicity to have the
   evening scene some resemblance of what you now enjoy.

   "In making you this address I have an additional pleasure in reflecting,
   that, so far as I have hitherto gone, I am not conscious of any
   circumstance in my conduct that should give you one repentant thought for
   being my patron and introducer to America.

   "It would give me great pleasure to make a journey to Philadelphia on
   purpose to see you, but an interesting affair I have with Congress makes
   my absence at this time improper.

   "If you have time to let me know how your health is, I shall be much
   obliged to you.

   "I am, dear Sir, with the sincerest affection and respect,

   "Your obedient, humble servant, 

   "THOMAS  PAINE.

   "The Hon'ble BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, Esquire.

   "My address is Messrs. Lawrence and Morris, Merchants."
   To this came the following reply, dated Philadelphia, September 24th: 

   "DEAR SIR,

   "I have just received your friendly congratulations on my return to
   America, for which, as well as your kind wishes for my welfare, I beg you
   to accept my most thankful acknowledgments. Ben is also very sensible of
   your politeness, and desires his respects may be presented.

   "I was sorry on my arrival to find you had left this city. Your present
   arduous undertaking, I easily conceive, demands retirement, and tho' we
   shall reap the fruits of it, I cannot help regretting the want of your
   abilities here where in the present moment they might, I think, be
   successfully employed. Parties still run very high -- Common Sense would
   unite them. It is to be hoped therefore it has not abandoned us
   forever."82

   The "arduous undertaking" to which Franklin refers was of course the iron
   bridge. But it will be seen by our next letter that Paine had another
   invention to lay before Franklin, to whom he hastened after receiving his
   $3,000 from Congress. 

   "Dec. 31, 1785.

   "DEAR SIR,

   "I send you the Candles I have been making; -- In a little time after they
   are lighted the smoke and flame separate, the one issuing from one end of
   the Candle, and the other from the other end. I supposed this to be
   because a quantity of air enters into the Candle between the Tallow and
   the flame, and in its passage downwards takes the smoke with it; for if
   you allow a quantity of air up the Candle, the current will be changed,
   and the smoke reascends, and in passing this the flame makes a small flash
   and a little noise.

   "But to express the Idea I mean, of the smoke descending more clearly it
   is this, -- that the air enters the Candle in the very place where the
   melted tallow is getting into the state of flame, and takes it down before
   the change is completed -- for there appears to me to be two kinds of
   smoke, humid matter which never can be flame, and enflameable matter which
   would be flame if some accident did not prevent the change being completed
   -- and this I suppose to be the case with the descending smoke of the
   Candle.

   "As you can compare the Candle with the Lamp, you will have an opportunity
   of ascertaining the cause -- why it will do in the one and not in the
   other. When the edge of the enflamed part of the wick is close with the
   edge of the Tin of the Lamp no counter current of air can enter -- but as
   this contact does not take place in the Candle a counter current enters
   and prevents the effect [?] in the candles which illuminates the Lamp. For
   the passing of the air thro' the Lamp does not, I imagine, burn the smoke,
   but burns up all the oil into flame, or by its rapidity prevents any part
   of the oil flying off in the state of half-flame which is smoke.

   "I do not, my Dear Sir, offer these reasons to you but to myself, for I
   have often observed that by lending words for my thoughts I understand my
   thoughts the better. Thoughts are a kind of mental smoke, which require
   words to illuminate them.

   "I am affectionately your Obt. & Hble. servant, 

   "THOMAS  PAINE.

   "I hope to be well enough tomorrow to wait on you."

   Paine had now to lay aside his iron arch and bridge a financial flood. A
   party had arisen in Philadelphia, determined to destroy the "Bank of North
   America." Paine had confidence in this bank, and no one knew its history
   better, for it had grown out of the subscription he headed (May, 1780)
   with $500 for the relief of Washington's suffering army. It had been
   incorporated by Congress, and ultimately by Pennsylvania, April 1, 1782.
   Investments and deposits by and in the Bank had become very large, and to
   repeal its charter was to violate a contract. The attack was in the
   interest of paper money, of which there was a large issue. The repeal had
   to be submitted to popular suffrage, and even Cheetham admits that Paine's
   pamphlet "probably averted the act of despotism." The pamphlet was
   entitled, "Dissertations on Government, the Affairs of the Bank, and Paper
   Money" (54 pages 8 vo). It was written and printed, Paine says in his
   preface (dated February 18, 1786), "during the short recess of the
   Assembly." This was between December 22d and February 26th.

   The first fourteen pages of the work are devoted to a consideration of
   general principles. Englishmen who receive their constitutional
   instruction from Walter Bagehot and Albert Dicey will find in this
   introduction by Paine the foundation of their Republic. In discussing
   "sovereignty" he points out that the term, when applied to a people, has a
   different meaning from the arbitrariness it signifies in a monarchy.
   "Despotism may be more effectually acted by many over a few, than by one
   over all." "A republic is a sovereignty of justice, in contradistinction
   to a sovereignty of will." The distinct powers of the legislature are
   stated -- those of legislation and those of agency. "All laws are acts,
   but all acts are not laws." Laws are for every individual; they may be
   altered. Acts of agency or negotiation are deeds and contracts. 

   "The greatness of one party cannot give it a superiority or advantage over
   the other. The state or its representative, the assembly, has no more
   power over an act of this kind, after it has passed, than if the state was
   a private person. It is the glory of a republic to have it so, because it
   secures the individual from becoming the prey of power, and prevents might
   from overcoming right. If any difference or dispute arise between the
   state and the individuals with whom the agreement is made respecting the
   contract, or the meaning or extent of any of the matters contained in the
   act, which may affect the property or interest of either, such difference
   or dispute must be judged of and decided upon by the laws of the land, in
   a court of justice and trial by jury; that is, by the laws of the land
   already in being at the time such act and contract was made."

   "That this is justice," adds Paine, "that it is the true principle of
   republican government, no man will be so hardy as to deny." So, indeed, it
   seemed in those days. In the next year those principles were embodied in
   the Constitution; and in 1792, when a State pleaded its sovereign right to
   repudiate a contract ("Chisholm vs. Georgia") the Supreme Court affirmed
   every contention of Paine's pamphlet, using his ideas and sometimes his
   very phrases.

   Our first Attorney-General (Edmund Randolph, of Virginia) eloquently
   maintained that the inferiority of one party, or dignity of the other,
   could not affect the balances of justice. Individuals could not be left
   the victims of States. So it was decided. Justice Wilson remarked that the
   term sovereignty is unknown to the Constitution. "The term 'sovereign' has
   for its correlative 'subject.' " A State contracting as a merchant cannot,
   when asked to fulfil its contract, take refuge in its "sovereignty." "The
   rights of individuals," said Justice Cushing, "and the justice due to them
   are as dear and precious as those of States. Indeed the latter are founded
   on the former; and the great end and object of them must be to secure, and
   support the rights of individuals, or else vain is government."83 But the
   decline -- of republicanism set in; the shameful Eleventh Amendment was
   adopted; Chisholm was defrauded of his victory by a retrospective action
   of this amendment; and America stands to-day as the only nation professing
   civilization, which shields repudiation under "State sovereignty."

   In the strength of these principles Paine was able to overwhelm the whole
   brood of heresies, State privilege, legal tender, repudiation,
   retrospective laws. His arguments are too modern to need repetition here;
   in fineness and force they are like the ribs of his bridge: as to-day
   commerce travels on Paine's iron span, so on his argumentative arch it
   passes over freshets endangering honest money.

   For a like reason it is unnecessary to give here all the details of his
   bridge sent by Paine to his correspondents. Of this invention more is said
   in further chapters, but the subjoined letters are appropriate at this
   point. The first two were written at Bordentown, where Paine settled
   himself in the spring.

   To Franklin, undated: 

   "I send you the two essays I mentioned. As the standing or not standing of
   such an arch is not governed by opinions, therefore opinions one way or
   the other will not alter the fact. The opinions of its standing will not
   make it stand, the opinions of its falling will not make it fall; but I
   shall be exceedingly obliged to you to bestow a few thoughts on the
   subject and to communicate to me any difficulties or doubtfulness that may
   occur to you, because it will be of use to me to know them. As you have
   not the model to look at I enclose a sketch of a rib, except that the
   blocks which separate the bars are not represented."

   To Franklin, June 6th: 

   "The gentleman, Mr. Hall, who presents you with this letter, has the care
   of two models for a bridge, one of wood, the other of cast iron, which I
   have the pleasure of submitting to you, as well for the purpose of showing
   my respect to you, as my patron in this country, as for the sake of having
   your opinion and judgment thereon. -- The European method of bridge
   architecture, by piers and arches, is not adapted to many of the rivers in
   America on account of the ice in the winter. The construction of those I
   have the honor of presenting to you is designed to obviate the difficulty
   by leaving the whole passage of the river clear of the incumbrance of
   piers . . . My first design in the wooden model was for a bridge over the
   Harlem River, for my good friend General Morris of Morrisania ... but I
   cannot help thinking that it might be carried across the Schuylkill. . . .
   Mr. Hall, who has been with me at Borden Town, and has done the chief
   share of the working part, for we have done the whole ourselves, will
   inform you of any circumstance relating to it which does not depend on the
   mathematical construction. Mr. Hall will undertake to see the models
   brought safe from the stage boat to you; they are too large to be admitted
   into the house, but will stand very well in the garden. Should there be a
   vessel going round to New York within about a week after my arrival in
   Philadelphia I shall take that convenience for sending them there, at
   which place I hope to be in about a fortnight."

   Address and date not given; written in Philadelphia, probably in June: 

   "Honorable Sir,

   I have sent to His Excellency, the President [Franklin] two models for a
   Bridge, the one of wood the other of cast-iron bars, to be erected over
   rivers, without piers. As I shall in a few days go to New York, and take
   them with me, I do myself the honor of presenting an invitation to Council
   to take a view of them before they are removed. If it is convenient to
   Council to see and examine their construction to-day, at the usual time of
   their adjournment, I will attend at the President's at half after twelve
   o'clock, or any other day or hour Council may please to appoint."84

   To the Hon. Thomas Fitzsimmons; addressed "To be left at the Bank,
   Philadelphia." Written at Bordentown, November 19th. 

   "I write you a few loose thoughts as they occur to me. Next to the gaining
   a majority is that of keeping it. This, at least (in my opinion), will not
   be best accomplished by doing or attempting a great deal of business, but
   by doing no more than is absolutely necessary to be done, acting
   moderately and giving no offence. It is with the whole as it is with the
   members individually, and we always see at every new election that it is
   more difficult to turn out an old member against whom no direct complaint
   can be made than it is to put in -- a new one though a better man. I am
   sure it will be best not to touch any part of the plan of finance this
   year. If it falls short, as most probably it will, it would be (I speak
   for myself) best to reduce the interest that the whole body of those who
   are stiled public creditors may share it equally as far as it will go. If
   any thing can be saved from the Civil List expences it ought not to be
   finally mortgaged to make up the deficiency; it may be applied to bring
   the creditors to a balance for the present year. There is more to be said
   respecting this debt than has yet been said. The matter has never been
   taken up but by those who were interested in the matter. The public has
   been deficient and the claimants exorbitant neglect on one side and
   grediness on the other. That which is truly justice may be always
   advocated. But I could no more think of paying six per cent Interest in
   real money, in perpetuity, for a debt a great part of which is quondam
   than I could think of not paying at all. Six per cent on any part of the
   debt, even to the original holders is ten or twelve per cent, and to the
   speculators twenty or thirty or more. It is better that the matter rest
   until it is fuller investigated and better understood, for in its present
   state it will be hazardous to touch upon. investigated and better
   understood, for in its present state it will be hazardous to touch upon.

   "I have not heard a word of news from Philadelphia since I came to this
   place. I wrote a line to Mr. Francis and desired him to give me a little
   account of matters but he does not, perhaps, think it very necessary now.

   "I see by the papers that the subject of the Bank is likely to be renewed.
   I should like to know when it will come on, as I have some thought of
   coming down at that time, if I can.

   "I see by the papers that the Agricultural Society have presented a
   petition to the house respecting building a Bridge over the Schuylkill --
   on a model prepared for that purpose. In this I think they are too hasty.
   I have already constructed a model of a Bridge of Cast Iron, consisting of
   one arch. I am now making another of wrought Iron of one arch, but on a
   different Plan. I expect to finish it in about three weeks and shall send
   it first to Philadelphia. I have no opinion of any Bridge over the
   Schuylkill that is to be erected on piers the sinking of piers will sink
   more money than they have any Idea of and will not stand when done. But
   there is another point they have not taken into their consideration; which
   is, that the sinking three piers in the middle of the river, large and
   powerful enough to resist the ice, will cause such an alteration in the
   bed and channel of the river that there is no saying what course it may
   take, or whether it will not force a new channel somewhere else."85

   To George Clymer, Esquire, "to be left at the Bank, Philadelphia." Written
   at Bordentown, November 19th. 

   "I observe by the minutes that the Agricultural Society have presented a
   petition to the house for an act of incorporation for the purpose of
   erecting a bridge over the Schuylkill on a model in their possession. I
   hope this business will not be gone into too hastily. A Bridge on piers
   will never answer for that river, they may sink money but they never will
   sink piers that will stand. But admitting that the piers do stand -- they
   will cause such an alteration in the Bed and channel of the river, as will
   most probable alter its course either to divide the channel, and require
   two bridges or cause it to force a new channel in some other part. It is a
   matter of more hazard than they are aware of the altering by obstructions
   the bed and channel of a River; the water must go somewhere -- the force
   of the freshets and the Ice is very great now but will be much greater
   then.

   "I am finishing as fast as I can my new model of an Iron Bridge of one
   arch which if it answers, as I have no doubt but it will, the whole
   difficulty of erecting Bridges over that river, or others of like
   circumstances, will be removed, and the expense not greater, (and I
   believe not so great) as the sum mentioned by Mr. Morris in the house, and
   I am sure will stand four times as long or as much longer as Iron is more
   durable than wood. I mention these circumstances to you that you may be
   informed of them -- and not let the matter proceed so far as to put the
   Agricultural Society -- in a difficult situation at last.

   "The giving a Society the exclusive right to build a bridge, unless the
   plan is prepared before hand, will prevent a bridge being built; because
   those who might afterwards produce models preferable to their own, will
   not present them to any such body of men, and they can have no right to
   take other peoples labours or inventions to compleat their own
   undertakings by.

   "I have not heard any news since I came to this place. I wish you would
   give me a line and let me know how matters are going on. -- The Stage Boat
   comes to Borden Town every Wednesday and Sunday from the Crooked Billet
   Wharf."86

   At the close of the war Paine was eager to visit England. He speaks of it
   in his letter of June 7, 1783, to Elias Boudinot, already referred to --
   but he had not the means. The measures for his remuneration had delayed
   him two and a half years, and it now became imperative that he should put
   in a fair way of success his invention of the bridge. The models made a
   good impression on Franklin and the Council, and a committee was appointed
   to investigate it. Early in the year following the Pennsylvania Assembly
   appointed another committee. But meanwhile Paine's correspondence with his
   parents determined him to visit them at once, and look after the interests
   of his invention upon his return87. He no doubt also thought, and it may
   have been suggested by Franklin, that the success of his bridge would be
   assured in America and England if it should receive approval of the
   engineers in France. In March, 1787, he is in Philadelphia, consulting
   committees, and on the 31st writes to Franklin of his prospects and
   plans: 

   "I mentioned in one of my essays my design of going this spring to Europe.
   -- I intend landing in france and from thence England, -- and that I
   should take the model with me. The time I had fixed with myself was May,
   but understanding (since I saw you yesterday) that no french packet sails
   that month, I must either take the April packet or wait till June. As I
   can get ready by the April packet I intend not omitting the opportunity.
   My Father and Mother are yet living, whom I am very anxious to see, and
   have informed them of my coming over the ensuing summer.

   "I propose going from hence by the stage on Wednesday for New York, and
   shall be glad to be favoured with the care of any letters of yours to
   France or England. My stay in Paris, when with Col. Laurens, was so short
   that I do not feel myself introduced there, for I was in no house but at
   Passy, and the Hotel Col. Laurens was at. As I have taken a part in the
   Revolution and politics of this country, and am not an unknown character
   in the political world, I conceive it would be proper on my going to
   Paris, that I should pay my respects to Count Vergennes, to whom I am
   personally unknown; and I shall be very glad of a letter from you to him
   affording me that opportunity, or rendering my waiting on him easy to me;
   for it so often happens that men live to forfeit the reputation at one
   time they gained at another, that it is prudent not to presume too much on
   one's self. The Marquis La Fayette I am the most known to of any gentleman
   in France. Should he be absent from Paris there are none I am much
   acquainted with. I am on exceeding good terms with Mr. Jefferson which
   will necessarily be the first place I go to. As I had the honor of your
   introduction to America it will add to my happiness to have the same
   friendship continued to me on the present occasion.

   "Respecting the model, I shall be obliged to you for a letter to some of
   the Commissioners in that department. I shall be glad to hear their
   opinion of it. If they will undertake the experiment of two Ribs, it will
   decide the matter and promote the work here, -- but this need not be
   mentioned. The Assembly have appointed another Committee, consisting of
   Mr. Morris, Mr. Clymer, Mr. Fitzsimons, Mr. Wheeler, Mr. Robinson, to
   confer with me on the undertaking. The matter therefore will remain
   suspended till my return next winter. It is worth waiting this event,
   because if a single arch to that extent will answer, all difficulties in
   that river, or others of the same condition, are overcome at once.

   "I will do myself the pleasure of waiting on you tomorrow."

   During the time when Paine was perfecting his bridge, and consulting the
   scientific committees, the country was absorbed with preparations for
   forming a national Constitution and Union. When the States were nominating
   and electing delegates to the Convention of 1787, no one seems to have
   suggested Paine for a seat in it, nor does he appear to have aspired to
   one. The reasons are not far to seek. Paine was altogether too inventive
   for the kind of work contemplated by the colonial politicians. He had
   shown in all his writings, especially in his "Dissertations on
   Government," that he would build a constitution as he built his bridge it
   must be mathematical, founded and shaped in impregnable principles, means
   adopted and adapted strictly for an ideal national purpose. His iron span
   did not consider whether there might be large interests invested in piers,
   or superstitions in favor of oak; as little did his anti-slavery essays
   consider the investments in slavery, or his "Public Good" the jealous
   sovereignty of States. A recent writer says that Paine's "Common
   Sense" was "just what the moment demanded," and that it "may be briefly
   described as a plea for independence and a continental government."88 In
   setting the nation at once to a discussion of the principles of such
   government, he led it to assume the principle of independence; over the
   old English piers on their quicksands, which some would rebuild, he threw
   his republican arch, on which the people passed from shore to shore. He
   and Franklin did the like in framing the Pennsylvania constitution of
   1776, by which the chasm of "Toryism" was spanned. Every pamphlet of Paine
   was of the nature of an invention, by which principles of liberty and
   equality were framed in constructions adapted to emergencies of a
   republic. But when the emergencies were past, the old contrivances
   regained their familiar attractions, and these were enhanced by
   independence. Privilege, so odious in Lords, was not so bad' when
   inherited by democracy; individual sovereignty, unsuited to King George,
   might be a fine thing for President George; and if England had a House of
   Peers, why should we not make one out cf a peerage of States? "Our
   experience in republicanism," wrote Paine, "is yet so slender, that it is
   much to be doubted whether all our public laws and acts are consistent
   with, or can be justified on, the principles of a republican government."
   But the more he talked in this way, or reminded the nation of the
   "Declaration of Independence" and the "Bill of Rights," the more did he
   close the doors of the Constitutional Convention against himself.

   In those days there used to meet in Franklin's library a "Society for
   Political Inquiries." It had forty-two members, among them Washington,
   James Wilson, Robert Morris, Gouverneur Morris, Clymer, Rush, Bingham,
   Bradford, Hare, Rawle, and Paine. A memorandum of Rawle says: "Paine never
   opened his mouth, but he furnished one of the few essays which the members
   of the Society were expected to produce. It was a well written
   dissertation on the inexpediency of incorporating towns."89 That in such
   company, and at such a time; Paine should be silent; or discuss
   corporations, suggests political solitude. Franklin, indeed, agreed with
   him, but was too old to struggle against the reaction in favor of the
   bicameral and other English institutions.

   M. Chanut ("Nouv. Biog. Generale" ) says that Paine's bridge was not
   erected on the Schuylkill because of "the imperfect state of iron
   manufacture in America." Something of the same kind might be said of the
   state of political architecture. And so it was, that while the Convention
   was assembling in Independence Hall, he who first raised the standard of
   Independence, and before the Declaration proposed a Charter of the "United
   Colonies of America," was far out at sea on his way to rejoin his comrades
   in the old world, whose hearts and burdens he had represented in the new.

   The printed Rules of the Society (founded February 9, 1787) are in the
   Philosophical Society, Philadelphia. The preamble, plainly Paine's, says;
   "Important as these inquiries are to all, to the inhabitants of these
   republics they are objects of peculiar magnitude and necessity. Accustomed
   to look up to those nations, from whom we have derived our origin, for our
   laws, our opinions, and our manners, we have retained with
   undistinguishing reverence their errors, with their improvements; have
   blended with our public institutions the policy of dissimilar countries;
   and have grafted on our infant commonwealth the manners of ancient and
   corrupted monarchies. In having effected a separate government, we have as
   yet effected but a partial independence. The revolution can only be said
   to be compleat, when we shall have freed ourselves, no less from the
   influence of foreign prejudices than from the fetters of foreign power." 
    

    

                                  CHAPTER  XVI

                           RETURNING TO THE OLD HOME 
                                  [1787-1788]

   EVEN now one can hardly repress regret that Paine did not remain in his
   beloved Bordentown. There he was the honored man; his striking figure,
   decorated with the noblest associations, was regarded with pride; when he
   rode the lanes on his horse Button, the folk had a pleasant word with him;
   the best homes prized his intimacy, and the young ladies would sometimes
   greet the old gentleman with a kiss. From all this he was drawn by the
   tender letter of a father he was never to see again. He sailed in April
   for a year's absence; he remained away fifteen, -- if such years, may be
   reckoned by calendar.

   The French packet. from New York had a swift voyage, and early in the
   summer Paine was receiving honors in Paris. Franklin had given him letters
   of introduction, but he hardly needed them90. He was already a hero of the
   progressives, who had relished his artistic dissection of the Abbe
   Raynal's disparagement of the American Revolution. Among those who greeted
   him was Auberteuil, whose history of the American Revolution Paine had
   corrected, an early copy having been sent him (1783) by Franklin for that
   purpose. But Paine's main object in France was to secure a verdict from
   the Academy of Sciences, the supreme authority, on his bridge, a model of
   which he carried with him. The Academy received him with the honors due to
   an M.A. of the University of Pennsylvania, a member of the Philosophical
   Society, and a friend of Franklin. It appointed M. Leroy, M. Bossou, and
   M. Borda a committee to report on his bridge. On August 18th he writes to
   Jefferson, then Minister in Paris: 

   "I am much obliged to you for the book you are so kind to send me. The
   second part of your letter, concerning taking my picture, I must feel as
   an honor done to me, not as a favour asked of me -- but in this, as in
   other matters, I am at the disposal of your friendship.

   "The committee have among themselves finally agreed on their report; I saw
   this morning it will be read in the Academy on Wednesday. The report goes
   pretty fully to support the principles of the construction, with their
   reasons for that opinion.

   On August 15th, a cheery letter had gone to George Clymer in Philadelphia,
   in which he says: 

   "This comes by Mr. Derby, of Massachusetts, who leaves Paris to-day to
   take shipping at L' [Orient] for Boston. The enclosed for Dr. Franklin is
   from his friend Mr. Le Roy, of the Academy of Sciences, respecting the
   bridge, and the causes that have delayed the completing report. An arch of
   4 or 5 hundred feet is such an unprecedented thing, and will so much
   attract notice in the northern part of Europe, that the Academy is
   cautious in what manner to express their final opinion. It is, I find,
   their custom to give reasons for their opinion, and this embarrasses them
   more than the opinion itself. That the model is strong, and that a bridge
   constructed on the same principles will also be strong, they appear to be
   well agreed in, but to what particular causes to assign the strength they
   are not agreed in. The Committee was directed by the Academy to examine
   all the models and plans for iron bridges that had been proposed in
   France, and they unanimously gave the preference to our own, as being the
   simplest, strongest, and lightest. They have likewise agreed on some
   material points."91

   Dr. Robinet says that on this visit (1787) Paine, who had long known the
   "soul of the people," came into relation with eminent men of all groups,
   philosophical and political, -- Condorcet, Achille Duchatelet, Cardinal De
   Brienne, and, he believes, also Danton, who, like the English republican,
   was a freemason92. This intercourse, adds the same author, enabled him to
   print in England his remarkable prophecy concerning the change going on in
   the French mind. Dr. Robinet quotes from a pamphlet presently noticed,
   partly written in Paris during this summer. Although it was Paine's
   grievous destiny soon to be once more a revolutionary figure, it is
   certain that he had returned to Europe as an apostle of peace and
   good-will. While the engineers were considering his daring scheme of an
   iron arch of five hundred feet, he was devising with the Cardinal
   Minister, De Brienne, a bridge of friendship across the Channel. He drew
   up a paper in this sense, on which the Minister wrote and signed his
   approval. The bridge-model approved by the Academy he sent to Sir Joseph
   Banks, President of the Royal Society; the proposal for friendship between
   France and England, approved by the Cardinal Minister, he carried by his
   own hand to Edmund Burke.

   On his arrival in London Paine gave to the printer a manuscript on which
   he had been engaged, and straightway went to Thetford93. His father had
   died the year before94. His mother, now in her ninety-first year, he found
   in the comfort his remittances had supplied. The house, with its large
   garden, stands in Guildhall (then Heathenman) Street. I was politely shown
   through it by its present occupant, Mr. Brett. Mr. Stephen Oldman, Sr.,
   who went to school in the house, told me that it was identified by "old
   Jack Whistler," a barber, as the place where he went to shave Paine, in
   1787. At this time Paine settled on his mother an allowance of nine
   shillings per week, which in the Thetford of that period was ample for her
   comfort. During this autumn with his mother he rarely left her side. As
   she lived to be ninety-four it may be that he sat beside her in the Quaker
   meeting-house, to which she had become attached in her latter years.

   Eloquent and pathetic must have been the silence around the gray man when,
   after so many tempests, he sat once more in the little meeting-house where
   his childhood was nurtured. From this, his spiritual cradle, he had borne
   away a beautiful theory, in ignorance of the contrasted actuality.
   Theoretically the Society of Friends is a theocracy; the Spirit alone
   rules and directs, effacing all distinctions of rank or sex. As a matter
   of fact, one old Quaker, or the clerk of a meeting, often over rules the
   "inner lights" of hundreds. Of the practical working of Quaker government
   Paine had no experience; he had nothing to check his ideal formed in
   boyhood. His whole political system is explicable only by his theocratic
   Quakerism. His first essay, the plea for negro emancipation, was brought
   from Thetford meeting-house. His "Common Sense," a new-world scripture, is
   a "testimony" against the proud who raised their paltry dignities above
   the divine presence in the lowliest. "But where, say some, is the King of
   America?   I'll tell you, friend, he reigns above." Paine's love of his
   adopted country was not mere patriotism; he beheld in it the land of
   promise for all mankind, seen from afar while on his Thetford Pisgah.
   Therefore he made so much of the various races in America. 

   "The mere independence of America, were it to have been followed by a
   system of government modelled after the corrupt system of the English
   government, would not have interested me with the unabated ardour that it
   did. It was to bring forward and establish the representative system of
   government that was the leading principle with me."

   So he spake to Congress, and to its president he said that he would have
   done the same for any country as for America. The religious basis of his
   political system has a droll illustration in an anecdote of his early life
   told by himself. While bowling with friends at Lewes, Mr. Verril remarked
   that Frederick of Prussia "was the best fellow in the world for a king; he
   had so much of the devil in him." It struck Paine that "if it were
   necessary for a king to have so much of the devil in him, kings might very
   beneficially be dispensed with." From this time he seems to have developed
   a theory of human rights based on theocracy; and so genuinely that in
   America, while the Bible was still to him the word of God, he solemnly
   proposed, in the beginning of the Revolution, that a crown should be
   publicly laid on that book, to signify to the world that "in America the
   Law is King."

   While in America the States were discussing the Constitution proposed by
   the Convention, Paine sat in the silent meeting at Thetford dreaming of
   the Parliament of Man, and federation of the world. In America the dawn of
   the new nation was a splendor, but it paled the ideals that had shone
   through the night of struggle. The principles of the Declaration, which
   would have freed every slave, -- representation proportionate to
   population, so essential to equality, the sovereignty of justice instead
   of majorities or of States, -- had become "glittering generalities." The
   first to affirm the principles of the Declaration, Paine awaited the
   unsummoned Convention that would not compromise any of them away. For
   politicians these lofty ideas might be extinguished by the rising of a
   national sun; but in Paine there remained the deep Quaker well where the
   stars shone on through the garish day95.

   Seated in the Quaker meeting-house beside his mother, and beside his
   father's fresh grave, Paine revises the past while revising the proofs of
   his pamphlet. The glamor of war, even of the American Revolution, fades;
   the shudder with which he saw in childhood soldiers reeking from the
   massacres of Culloden and Inverness returns; he begins his new career in
   the old world with a "testimony" against war96. 

   "When we consider, for the feelings of Nature cannot be dismissed, the
   calamities of war and the miseries it indicts upon the human species, the
   thousands and tens of thousands of every age and sex who are rendered
   wretched by the event, surely there is something in the heart of man that
   calls upon him to think! Surely there is some tender chord, tuned by the
   hand of the Creator, that still struggles to emit in the hearing of the
   soul a note of sorrowing sympathy. Let it then be heard, and let man learn
   to feel that the true greatness of a nation is founded on principles of
   humanity . . . . War involves in its progress such a train of unforeseen
   and unsupposed circumstances, such a combination of foreign matters, that
   no human wisdom can calculate the end. It has but one thing certain, and
   that is to increase taxes . . . . I defend the cause of the poor, of the
   manufacturer, of the tradesman, of the farmer, and of all those on whom
   the real burthen of taxes fall -- but above all, I defend the cause of
   humanity."

   So little did Paine contemplate or desire revolution in England or France.
   His exhortation to young Pitt is to avoid war with Holland, to be friendly
   with France, to shun alliances involving aid in war, and to build up the
   wealth and liberties of England by uniting the people with the throne. He
   has discovered that this healthy change is going on in France. The French
   people are allying "the Majesty of the Sovereign with the Majesty of the
   Nation." "Of all alliances this is infinitely the strongest and the safest
   to be trusted to, because the interest so formed and operating against
   external enemies can never be divided." Freedom doubles the value of the
   subject to the government. When the desire of freedom becomes universal
   among the people, then, "and not before, is the important moment for the
   most effectual consolidation of national strength and greatness." The
   government must not be frightened by disturbances incidental to beneficent
   changes. "The creation we enjoy arose out of a chaos."97

   Paine had seen a good deal of Jefferson in Paris, and no doubt their
   conversation often related to struggles in the Constitutional Convention
   at Philadelphia. Jefferson wished the Constitution to include a
   Declaration of Rights, and wrote Paine some comments on the argument of
   James Wilson (afterward of the Supreme Court), maintaining that such a
   Declaration was unnecessary in a government without any powers not
   definitely granted, and that such a Declaration might be construed to
   imply some degree of power over the matters it defined. Wilson's speeches,
   powerfully analyzing the principles of liberty and federation, were
   delivered on October 6th and November 24th, and it will appear by the
   subjoined paper that they were more in accord with Paine's than with
   Jefferson's principles. The manuscript, which is among Jefferson's papers,
   bears no date, but was no doubt written at Thetford early in the year
   1788. 

   "After I got home, being alone and wanting amusement, I sat down to
   explain to myself (for there is such a thing) my ideas of national and
   civil rights, and the distinction between them. I send them to you to see
   how nearly we agree.

   "Suppose twenty persons, strangers to each other, to meet in a country not
   before inhabited. Each would be a Sovereign in his own natural right. His
   will would be his law, but his power, in many cases, inadequate to his
   right; and the consequence would be that each might be exposed, not only
   to each other, but to the other nineteen. It would then occur to them that
   their condition would be much improved, if a way could be devised to
   exchange that quantity of danger into so much protection; so that each
   individual should possess the strength of the whole number. As all their
   rights in the first case are natural rights, and the exercise of those
   rights supported only by their own natural individual power, they would
   begin by distinguishing between those rights they could individually
   exercise, fully and perfectly, and those they could not. Of the first kind
   are the rights of thinking, speaking, forming and giving opinions, and
   perhaps are those which can be fully exercised by the individual without
   the aid of exterior assistance; or in other words, rights of personal
   competency. Of the second kind are those of personal protection, of
   acquiring and possessing property, in the exercise of which the individual
   natural power is less than the natural right.

   "Having drawn this line they agree to retain individually the first class
   of Rights, or those of personal competency; and to detach from their
   personal possession the second class, or those of defective power, and to
   accept in lieu thereof a right to the whole power produced by a
   condensation of all the parts. These I conceive to be civil rights, or
   rights of compact, and are distinguishable from natural rights because in
   the one we act wholly in our own person, in the other we agree not to do
   so, but act under the guarantee of society.

   "It therefore follows that the more of those imperfect natural rights or
   rights of imperfect power we give up, and thus exchange, the more security
   we possess; and as the word liberty is often mistakenly put for security,
   Mr. Wilson has confused his argument by confounding the terms. But it does
   not follow that the more natural rights of every kind we assign the more
   security we possess, because if we resign those of the first class we may
   suffer much by the exchange; for where the right and the power are equal
   with each other in the individual, naturally, they ought to rest there.

   "Mr. Wilson must have some allusion to this distinction, or his position
   would be subject to the inference you draw from it.

   "I consider the individual sovereignty of the States retained under the
   act of confederation to be of the second class of right. It becomes
   dangerous because it is defective in the power necessary to support it. It
   answers the pride and purpose of a few men in each State, but the State
   collectively is injured by it."

   The paper just quoted may be of importance to those students of Yale
   College who shall compete for the Ten Eyck prize of 1892, on the
   interesting subject, "Thomas Paine: Deism and Democracy in the Days of the
   American Revolution." There was no nearer approach to democracy, in
   Paine's theory, than that of this paper sent to Jefferson. The
   Constitutional Convention represented to him the contracting People, all
   the individuals being parties to a Compact whereby every majority pledges
   itself to protect the minority in matters not essential to the security of
   all. In representative government thus limited by compact he recognized
   the guaranty of individual freedom and influence by which the mass could
   be steadily enlightened. Royall Tyler considered some of his views on
   these subjects "whimsical paradoxes"; but they are not so "unaccountable"
   as he supposed. Tyler's portraiture of Paine in London, though somewhat
   adapted to prejudices anent "The Age of Reason," is graphic, and Paine's
   anti-democratic paradox wittily described. 

   "I met this interesting personage at the lodgings of the son of a late
   patriotic American governour [Trumbull]. . . He was dressed in a
   snuff-coloured coat, olive velvet vest, drab breeches, coarse hose. His
   shoe buckles of the size of a half dollar. A bob tailed wig covered that
   head which worked such mickle woe to courts and kings. If I should attempt
   to describe it, it would be in the same stile and principle with which the
   veteran soldier bepraiseth an old standard: the more tattered, the more
   glorious. It is probable that this was the same identical wig under the
   shadow of whose curls he wrote Common Sense, in America, many years
   before. He was a spare man, rather under size; subject to the extreme of
   low, and highly exhilirating spirits; often sat reserved in company;
   seldom mingled n common chit chat: But when a man of sense and elocution
   was present, and the company numerous, he delighted in advancing the most
   unaccountable, and often the most whimsical paradoxes; which he defended
   in his own plausible manner. If encouraged by success, or the applause of
   the company, his countenance was animated with an expression of feature
   which, on ordinary occasions one would look for in vain, in a man so much
   celebrated for acuteness of thought; but if interrupted by extraneous
   observation, by the inattention of his auditory, or in an irritable
   moment, even by the accidental fall of the poker, he would retire into
   himself, and no persuasion could induce him to proceed upon the most
   favourite topic. . . . I heard Thomas Paine once assert in the presence of
   Mr. Wolcott, better known, in this country, by the facetious name of Peter
   Pindar, that the minority, in all deliberative bodies, ought, in all
   cases, to govern the majority. Peter smiled. You must grant me,
   said Uncommon Sense, that the proportion of men of sense, to the ignorant
   among mankind, is at least as twenty, thirty, or even forty-nine, to an
   hundred. The majority of mankind are consequently most prone to errour;
   and if we achieve the right, the minority ought in all cases to govern.
   Peter continued to smile archly."98

   In the end this theory was put to a vote of the company present, and all
   arose with Paine except Peter Pindar, who thereupon said, "I am the wise
   minority who ought, in all cases, to govern your ignorant majority."

    

                                 CHAPTER  XVII

                     A BRITISH LION WITH AN AMERICAN HEART 
                                  [1788-1789]

   THE influence of Paine's Quaker training has been traced in his
   constructive politics, but its repressive side had more perhaps to do with
   his career. "I had some turn," he said, "and I believe some talent, for
   poetry; but this I rather repressed than encouraged." It is your
   half-repressed poets that kindle revolutions. History might be different
   had Paine not been taught fear of music and poetry. He must have epical
   common-wealths. The American Republic having temporarily filled his ideal
   horizon in the political direction, the disguised Muse turned his eye upon
   the possibilities of nature. Morally utilitarian, he yet rarely writes
   about physics without betraying the poetic passion for nature of a
   suppressed Wordsworth. Nature is his Aphrodite and his Madonna. 

   "Bred up in antediluvian notions, she has not yet acquired the European
   taste of receiving visitors in her dressing-room; she locks and bolts up
   her private recesses with extraordinary care, as if not only resolved to
   preserve her hoards but conceal her age, and hide the remains of a face
   that was young and lovely in the days of Adam."

   Defining for Jefferson the distinction between attraction and cohesion, he
   says:

   "I recollect a scene at one of the theatres which very well explains the
   difference. A condemned lady wishes to see her child and the child its
   mother: that is Attraction. They were admitted to meet, but when ordered
   to part threw their arms around each other and fastened their persons
   together: this is Cohesion."

   All the atoms or molecules are little mothers and daughters and lovers
   clasping each other; it is an interlocking of figures; "and if our eyes
   were good enough we should see how it was done." He has a transcendental
   perception of unity in things. dissimilar. On his walks to Challiot he
   passes trees and fountains, and writes a little essay, with figures,
   explaining to his friend that the tree is also a fountain, and that by
   measuring diameters of trunks and tubes, or branches, the quantity of
   timber thrown up by sap-fountains might be known. Some of his casual
   speculations he calls "conceits." They are the exuberance of a scientific
   imagination inspired by philanthropy and naturalistic religion. The "inner
   light" of man corresponds to an "inner spirit" of nature. The human mind
   dimmed by ignorance, perverted by passion, turns the very gifts of nature
   to thorns, amid which her divine beauty sleeps until awakened by the kiss
   of science.

   It would be difficult to find anything in the literature of mechanical
   invention more naively picturesque than this Quaker, passed through
   furnaces of two revolutions, trying to humanize gunpowder. Here is a
   substance with maximum of power and minimum of bulk and weight. 

   "When I consider the wisdom of nature I must think that she endowed matter
   with this extraordinary property for other purposes than that of
   destruction. Poisons are capable of other uses than that of killing. If
   the power which an ounce of gunpowder contains could be detailed out as
   steam or water can be it would be a most commodious natural power."

   Having failed to convert revolutions to Quakerism, Paine tries to soften
   the heart of gunpowder itself, and insists that its explosiveness may be
   restrained and detailed like strokes on a boy's top to obtain continual
   motion. The sleeping top, the chastened repose of perfect motion, like the
   quiet of the spinning worlds, is the Quaker inventor's ideal, and he begs
   the President of the United States to try the effect of the smallest
   pistol made the size of a quill -- on a wheel with peripheral cups to
   receive the discharges.99

   "The biographers of Paine," wrote his friend, Joel Barlow, "should not
   forget his mathematical acquirements and his mechanical genius." But it
   would require a staff of specialists, and a large volume, to deal with
   Paine's scientific studies and contrivances -- with his planing machine,
   his new crane, his smokeless candle, his wheel of concentric rim, his
   scheme for using gunpowder as a motor, above all his iron bridge. As for
   the bridge, Paine feels that it is a sort of American revolution carried
   into mechanics; his eagle cannot help spreading a little in the wondering
   eyes of the Old World. "Great scenes inspire great ideas," he writes to
   Sir George Staunton.

   "The natural mightiness of America expands the mind, and it partakes of
   the greatness it contemplates. Even the war, with all its evils, had some
   advantages. It energized invention and lessened the catalogue of
   impossibilities. At the conclusion of it every man returned to his home to
   repair the ravages it had occasioned, and to think of war no more. As one
   amongst thousands who had borne a share in that memorable revolution, I
   returned with them to the re-enjoyment of quiet life, and, that I might
   not be idle, undertook to construct a single arch for this river
   [Schuylkill]. Our beloved General had engaged in rendering another river,
   the Potowmac, navigable. The quantity of iron I had allowed in my plan for
   this arch was five hundred and twenty tons, to be distributed into
   thirteen ribs, in commemoration of the Thirteen United States."

   It is amusing after this to find Paine, in his patent, declaring his
   special license from "His Most Excellent Majesty King George the
   Third."100 Had poor George been in his right senses, or ever heard of the
   invention, he might have suspected some connection between this
   insurrection of the iron age and the American "rebellion." However, Paine
   is successful in keeping America out of his specification, albeit a poetic
   touch appears. 

   "The idea and construction of this arch is taken from the figure of a
   spider's circular web, of which it resembles a section, and from a
   conviction that when nature empowered this insect to make a web she also
   instructed her in the strongest mechanical method of constructing it.
   Another idea, taken from nature in the construction of this arch, is that
   of increasing the strength of matter by dividing and combining it, and
   thereby causing it to act over a larger space than it would occupy in a
   solid state, as is seen in the quills of birds, bones of animals, reeds,
   canes, &c. The curved bars of the arch are composed of pieces of any
   length joined together to the whole extent of the arch, and take curvature
   by bending."

   Paine and his bridge came to England at a fortunate moment. Blackfriars
   Bridge had just given way, and two over the Tyne, one built by Smeaton,
   had collapsed by reason of quicksands under their piers. And similarly
   Pitt's policy was collapsing through the treacherous quicksands on which
   it was based. Paper money and a "sinking fund" at home, and foreign
   alliances that disregarded the really controlling interests of nations,
   Paine saw as piers set in the Channel101. He at once took his place in
   England as a sort of institution. While the engineers beheld with
   admiration his iron arch clearing the treacherous river-beds, statesmen
   saw with delight his prospective bridges spanning the political "Rubicon."
   Nothing could be more felicitous than the title of his inaugural
   pamphlet, "Prospects on the Rubicon." It remembered an expression in
   Parliament at the beginning of the war on America, " 'The Rubicon is
   passed,' was once given as a reason for prosecuting the most expensive war
   that England ever knew. Sore with the event, and groaning beneath a
   galling yoke of taxes, she has again been led ministerially on to the
   shore of the same delusive and fatal river." The bridge-builder stretches
   his shining arches to France, Holland, Germany, -- free commerce and
   friendship with all peoples, but no leagues with the sinking piers called
   thrones.

   At Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where Messrs. Walker fitted up a workshop for
   Paine102, he was visited by famous engineers and political personages.
   There and in London he was "lionized," as Franklin had been in Paris. We
   find him now passing a week with Edmund Burke, now at the country-seat of
   the Duke of Portland, or enjoying the hospitalities of Lord Fitzwilliam at
   Wentworth House. He is entertained and consulted on public affairs by Fox,
   Lord Lansdowne, Sir George Staunton, Sir Joseph Banks; and many an effort
   is made to enlist his pen. Lord Lansdowne, it appears, had a notion of
   Paine's powers of political engineering so sublime that he thought he
   might bridge the Atlantic, and re-connect England and America.

   All of this may be gathered from the Jefferson papers, as we shall
   presently see; but it should be remarked here that Paine's head was not
   turned by his association with the gentry and aristocracy. The impression
   he made on these eminent gentlemen was largely due to his freedom from
   airs. They found him in his workshop, hammer in hand, proud only of free
   America and of his beautiful arch.

   Professor Peter Lesley of Philadelphia tells me that when visiting in
   early life the works at Rotherham, Paine's workshop and the very tools he
   used were pointed out. They were preserved with care. He conversed with an
   aged and intelligent workman who had worked under Paine as a lad.
   Professor Lesley, who had shared some of the prejudice against Paine, was
   impressed by the earnest words of this old man. Mr. Paine, he said, was
   the most honest man, and the best man he ever knew. After he had been
   there a little time everybody looked up to him, the Walkers and their
   workmen. He knew the people for miles round, and went into their homes;
   his benevolence, his friendliness, his knowledge, made him beloved by all,
   rich and poor. His memory had always lasted there.

   In truth Paine, who had represented the heart of England, in America, was
   now representing the heart of America to England. America was working by
   his hand, looking through his eyes, and silently publishing to the people
   from whom he sprung what the new nation could make out of a starving
   English staymaker. He was a living Declaration of Independence. The
   Americans in London -- the artists West and Trumbull, the Alexanders
   (Franklin's connections), and others -- were fond of him as a friend and
   proud of him as a countryman.

   The subjoined letter to Benjamin West (afterwards P. R. A.) shows Paine's
   pleasant relations with that artist and with Trumbull. It is dated March
   8, 1789. 

   "I have informed James of the matter which you and I talked of on
   Saturday, and he is much rejoiced at an opportunity of shewing his
   gratitude to you for the permission you indulged him with in attending Mr.
   Trumbull at your rooms. As I have known his parents upwards of twenty
   years, and the manners and habits he has been educated in, and the
   disposition he is of, I can with confidence to myself undertake to vouch
   for the faithful discharge of any trust you may repose in him; and as he
   is a youth of quick discernment and a great deal of silent observation he
   cannot be easily imposed upon, or turned aside from his attention, by any
   contrivance of workmen. I will put him in a way of keeping a diary of
   every day's work he sees done, and of any observations he may make, proper
   for you to be informed of, which he can send once or twice a week to you
   at Windsor; and any directions you may have to give him in your absence
   can be conveyed through Mr. Trumbull, or what other method you please, so
   that James is certified they come from you.

   "James has made a tender of his service to Mr. Trumbull, if it should be
   of any use, when his picture is to be exhibited; but that will probably
   not be till nearly the time the impressions will be struck off. James need
   not entirely omit his drawing while he is attending the plates. Some
   employment will, in general, fix a person to a place better than having
   only to stand still and look on. I suppose they strike off about three
   impressions in an hour, and as James is master of a watch he will find
   their average of works, -- and also how fast they can work when they have
   a mind to make haste, -- and he can easily number each impression, which
   will be a double check on any being carried off. I intend visiting him
   pretty often, while he is on duty, which will be an additional
   satisfaction to yourself for the trust you commit to him."103

   This chapter may well close with a letter from Paine in London (January 6,
   1789) to his young friend "Kitty Nicholson," -- known at the Bordentown
   school, and in New York, -- on the occasion of her marriage with Colonel
   Few.104 Let those who would know the real Thomas Paine read this letter!

   "I sincerely thank you for your very friendly and welcome letter. I was in
   the country when it arrived and did not receive it soon enough to answer
   it by the return of the vessel.

   "I very affectionately congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Few on their happy
   marriage, and every branch of the families allied by that connection; and
   I request my fair correspondent to present me to her partner, and to say,
   for me, that he has obtained one of the highest Prizes on the wheel.
   Besides the pleasure which your letter gives me to hear you are all happy
   and well, it relieves me from a sensation not easy to be dismissed; and if
   you will excuse a few dull thoughts for obtruding themselves into a
   congratulatory letter I will tell you what it is. When I see my female
   friends drop off by matrimony I am sensible of something that affects me
   like a loss in spite of all the appearances of joy. I cannot help mixing
   the sincere compliment of regret with that of congratulation. It appears
   as if I had outlived or lost a friend. It seems to me as if the original
   was no more, and that which she is changed to forsakes the circle and
   forgets the scenes of former society. Felicities are cares superior to
   those she formerly cared for, create to her a new landscape of Life that
   excludes the little friendships of the past. It is not every lady's mind
   that is sufficiently capacious to. prevent those greater objects crowding
   out the less, or that can spare a thought to former friendships after she
   has given her hand and heart to the man who loves her. But the sentiment
   your letter contains has prevented these dull Ideas from mixing with the
   congratulation I present you, and is so congenial with the enlarged
   opinion I have always formed of you, that at the time I read your letter
   with pleasure I read it with pride, because it convinces me that I have
   some judgment in that most difficult science -- a Lady's mind. Most
   sincerely do I wish you all the good that Heaven can bless you with, and
   as you have in your own family an example of domestic happiness you are
   already in the knowledge of obtaining it. That no condition we can enjoy
   is an exemption from care -- that some shade will mingle itself with the
   brightest sunshine of Life -- that even our affections may become the
   instruments of our sorrows -- that the sweet felicities of home depend on
   good temper as well as on good sense, and that there is always something
   to forgive even in the nearest and dearest of our friends, -- are truths
   which, tho' too obvious to be told, ought never to be forgotten; and I
   know you will not esteem my friendship the less for impressing them upon
   you.

   "Though I appear a sort of wanderer, the married state has not a sincerer
   friend than I am. It is the harbour of human life, and is, with respect to
   the things of this world, what the next world is to this. It is home; and
   that one word conveys more than any other word can express. For a few
   years we may glide along the tide of youthful single life and be
   wonderfully delighted; but it is a tide that flows but once, and what is
   still worse, it ebbs faster than it flows, and leaves many a hapless
   voyager aground. I am one, you see that have experienced the fate, I am
   describing.105 I have lost my tide; it passed by while every thought of my
   heart was on the wing for the salvation of my dear America, and I have now
   as contentedly as I can, made myself a little bower of willows on the
   shore that has the solitary resemblance of a home. Should I always
   continue the tenant of this home, I hope my female acquaintance will ever
   remember that it contains not the churlish enemy of their sex, not the
   inaccessible cold hearted mortal, nor the capricious tempered oddity, but
   one of the best and most affectionate of their friends.

   "I did not forget the Dunstable hat, but it was not on wear here when I
   arrived. That I am a negligent correspondent I freely confess, and I
   always reproach myself for it. You mention only one letter, but I wrote
   twice; once by Dr. Derby, and another time by the Chevalier St. Tries --
   by whom I also wrote to Gen. Morris, Col. Kirkbride, and several friends
   in Philadelphia, but have received no answers. I had one letter from Gen.
   Morris last winter, which is all I have received from New York till the
   arrival of yours.

   "I thank you for the details of news you give. Kiss Molly Field for me and
   wish her joy, -- and all the good girls of Borden Town. How is my favorite
   Sally Morris, my boy Joe, and my horse Button? pray let me know. Polly and
   Nancy Rogers, -- are they married?  or do they intend to build bowers as I
   have done? If they do, I wish they would twist their green willows
   somewhere near to mine.

   "I am very much engaged here about my Bridge -- There is one building of
   my Construction at Messers. Walker's Iron Works in Yorkshire, and I have
   direction of it. I am lately come from thence and shall return again in
   two or three weeks.

   "As to news on this side the water, the king is mad, and there is great
   bustle about appointing a Regent. As it happens, I am in pretty close
   intimacy with the heads of the opposition -- the Duke of Portland, Mr. Fox
   and Mr. Burke. I have sent your letter to Mrs. Burke as a specimen of the
   accomplishments of the American Ladies. I sent it to Miss Alexander, a
   lady you have heard me speak of, and I asked her to give me a few of her
   thoughts how to answer it. She told me to write as I felt, and I have
   followed her advice.

   "I very kindly thank you for your friendly invitation to Georgia and if I
   am ever within a thousand miles of you, I will come and see you; though it
   be but for a day.

   "You touch me on a very tender part when you say my friends on your side
   the water `cannot be reconciled to the idea of my resigning my adopted
   America, even for my native England.'   They are right. Though I am in as
   elegant style of acquaintance here as any American that ever came over, my
   heart and myself are 3000 miles apart; and I had rather see my horse
   Button in his own stable, or eating the grass of Bordentown or Morrisania,
   than see all the pomp and show of Europe.

   "A thousand years hence (for I must indulge in a few thoughts) perhaps in
   less, America may be what England now is!   The innocence of her character
   that won the hearts of all nations in her favor may sound like a romance,
   and her inimitable virtue as if it had never been. The ruins of that
   liberty which thousands bled for, or suffered to obtain, may just furnish
   materials for a village tale or extort a sigh from rustic sensibility,
   while the fashionable of that day, enveloped in dissipation, shall deride
   the principle and deny the fact.

   "When we contemplate the fall of Empires and the extinction of nations of
   the ancient world, we see but little to excite our regret than the
   mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty
   pyramids, and walls and towers of the most costly workmanship. But when
   the Empire of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow
   will be infinitely greater than crumbling brass or marble can inspire. It
   will not then be said, here stood a temple of vast antiquity, -- here rose
   a Babel of invisible height, or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance;
   but here, ah painful thought! the noblest work of human wisdom, the
   grandest scene of human glory, the fair cause of freedom rose and fell!

   "Read this and then ask if I forget America -- But I 'll not be dull if I
   can help it, so I leave off, and close my letter tomorrow, which is the
   day the mail is made up for America.

   "January 7th. I have heard this morning with extreme concern of the death
   of our worthy friend Capt. Read. Mrs. Read lives in a house of mine at
   Bordentown, and you will much oblige me by telling her how much I am
   affected by her loss; and to mention to her, with that delicacy which such
   an offer and her situation require, and which no one knows better how to
   convey than yourself, that the two years' rent which is due I request her
   to accept of, and to consider herself at home till she hears further from
   me.

   "This is the severest winter I ever knew in England; the frost has
   continued upwards of five weeks, and is still likely to continue. All the
   vessels from America have been kept off by contrary winds. The 'Polly' and
   the `Pigeon' from Philadelphia and the 'Eagle' from Charleston are just
   got in.

   "If you should leave New York before I arrive (which I hope will not be
   the case) and should pass through Philadelphia, I wish you would do me the
   favor to present my compliments to Mrs. Powell, the lady whom I wanted an
   opportunity to introduce you to when you were in Philadelphia, but was
   prevented by your being at a house where I did not visit.

   "There is a Quaker favorite of mine at New York, formerly Miss Watson of
   Philadelphia; she is now married to Dr. Lawrence, and is an acquaintance
   of Mrs. Oswald: be so kind as to make her a visit for me. You will like
   her conversation. She has a little of the Quaker primness -- but of the
   pleasing kind -- about her.

   "I am always distressed at closing a letter, because it seems like taking
   leave of my friends after a parting conversation. Captain Nicholson, Mrs.
   Nicholson, Hannah, Fanny, James, and the little ones, and you my dear
   Kitty, and your partner for life -- God bless you all! and send me safe
   back to my much loved America! 
    

   "THOMAS  PAINE -- aet. 52. 
   "or if you better like it 

   "Common Sense.'

   "This comes by the packet which sails from Falmouth, 300 miles from
   London; but by the first vessel from London to New York I will send you
   some magazines. In the meantime be so kind as to write to me by the first
   opportunity. Remember me to the family at Morrisania, and all my friends
   at New York and Bordentown. Desire Gen. Morris to take another guinea of
   Mr. Constable, who has some money of mine in his hands, and give it to my
   boy Joe. Tell Sally to take care of `Button.'   Then direct for me at Mr.
   Peter Whiteside's London. When you are at Charleston remember me to my
   dear old friend Mrs. Lawrence, Col. and Mrs. L. Morris, and Col.
   Washington; and at Georgia, to Col. Walton.

   "Adieu."

                                 CHAPTER  XVIII

                     PAINE'S LETTERS TO JEFFERSON IN PARIS 
                                  [1788-1789]

   A NOTE of Paine to Jefferson, dated February 19, 1788, shows him in that
   city consulting with Lafayette about his bridge, and preparing a memorial
   for the government. The visit was no doubt meant to secure a patent, and
   also arrange for the erection of the bridge. This appears to be his last
   meeting with Jefferson in Europe. He must have returned soon to England,
   where a letter of June 15th reports to Jefferson large progress in his
   patent, and other arrangements. Paine's letters were by no means confined
   to his personal affairs. In one of his letters Jefferson says: "I have
   great confidence in your communications, and since Mr. Adams' departure I
   am in need of authentic information from that country." Jefferson
   subscribes his letters -- "I am with great and sincere attachment, dear
   Sir, your affectionate friend and servant," -- and Paine responded with
   wonted fidelity. For more than a year the United States government was
   supplied by Paine, mainly through Jefferson, with information concerning
   affairs in England. It will be seen by some of the subjoined extracts that
   Paine was recognized by English statesmen as a sort of American Minister,
   and that the information he transmits is rarely, if ever, erroneous. All
   of this would appear more clearly could space be here given to the entire
   letters. The omissions are chiefly of items of news now without interest,
   or of technical details concerning the bridge. It is only just to remind
   the reader, before introducing the quotations, that these letters were
   confidential, and to a very intimate friend, being thus not liable to any
   charge of egotism from the public, for whose eye they were not intended. 

   "LONDON, BROAD STREET BUILDINGS, No. 13. Sept. 9, 1788.

   "That I am a bad correspondent is so general a complaint against me, that
   I must expect the same accusation from you -- But hear me first -- When
   there is no matter to write upon, a letter is not worth the trouble of
   receiving and reading and while any thing which is to be the subject of a
   letter, is in suspence, it is difficult to write and perhaps best to let
   it alone -- 'least said is soonest mended,' and nothing said requires no
   mending.

   "The model has the good fortune of preserving in England the reputation
   which it received from the Academy of Sciences. It is a favourite hobby
   horse with all who have seen it; and every one who has talked with me on
   the subject advised me to endeavour to obtain a Patent, as it is only by
   that means that I can secure to myself the direction and management. For
   this purpose I went, in company with Mr. Whiteside to the office which is
   an appendage to Lord Sydney's -- told them who I was, and made an
   affidavit that the construction was my own Invention. This was the only
   step I took in the business. Last Wednesday I received a Patent for
   England, the next day a Patent for Scotland, and I am to have one for
   Ireland.

   "As I had already the opinion of the scientific judges both in France and
   England on the Model, it was also necessary that I should have that of the
   practical Iron men who must finally be the executors of the work. There
   are several capital Iron Works in this country, the principal of which are
   those in Shropshire, Yorkshire, and Scotland. It was my intention to have
   communicated with Mr. Wilkinson, who is one of the proprietors of the
   Shropshire Iron Works, and concerned in those in France, but his departure
   for Sweden before I had possession of the patents prevented me. The Iron
   Works in Yorkshire belonging to the Walkers near to Sheffield are the most
   eminent in England in point of establishment and property. The proprietors
   are reputed to be worth two hundred thousand pounds and consequently
   capable of giving energy to any great undertaking. A friend of theirs who
   had seen the model wrote to them on the subject, and two of them came to
   London last Fryday to see it and talk with me on the business. Their
   opinion is very decided that it can be executed either in wrought or cast
   Iron, and I am to go down to their Works next week to erect an experiment
   arch. This is the point I am now got to, and until now I had nothing to
   inform you of. If I succeed in erecting the arch all reasoning and opinion
   will be at an end, and, as this will soon be known, I shall not return to
   France till that time; and until then I wish every thing to remain
   respecting my Bridge over the Seine, in the state I left matters in when I
   came from France. With respect to the Patents in England it is my
   intention to dispose of them as soon as I have established the certainty
   of the construction.

   "Besides the ill success of Black friars Bridge, two Bridges built
   successively on the same spot, the last by Mr. Smeaton, at Hexham, over
   the Tyne in Northumberland, have fallen down, occasioned by quicksands
   under the bed of the river. If therefore arches can be extended in the
   proportion the model promises, the construction in certain situations,
   without regard to cheapness or dearness, will be valuable in all
   countries. . . . As to English news or Politics, there is little more than
   what the public papers contain. The assembling the States General, and the
   reappointment of Mr. Neckar, make considerable impression here. They
   overawe a great deal of the English habitual rashness, and check that
   triumph of presumption which they indulged themselves in with respect to
   what they called the deranged and almost ruinous condition of the finances
   of France. They acknowledge unreservedly that the natural resources of
   France are greater than those of England, but they plume themselves on the
   superiority of the means necessary to bring national resources forth. But
   the two circumstances above mentioned serve very well to lower this
   exaltation.

   "Some time ago I spent a week at Mr. Burke's, and the Duke of Portland's
   in Buckinghamshire. You will recollect that the Duke was the member during
   the time of the coalition -- he is now in the opposition, and I find the
   opposition as much warped in some respects as to Continental Politics as
   the Ministry. -- What the extent of the Treaty with Russia is, Mr. B[urke]
   says that he and all the opposition are totally unacquainted with; and
   they speak of it not as a very wise measure, but rather tending to involve
   England in unnecessary continental disputes. The preference of the
   opposition is to a connection with Prussia if it could have been obtained.
   Sir George Staunton tells me that the interference with respect to Holland
   last year met with considerable opposition from part of the Cabinet. Mr.
   Pitt was against it at first, but it was a favourite measure with the
   King, and that the opposition at that crisis contrived to have it known to
   him that they were disposed to support his measures. This together with
   the notification of the 16th of September gave Mr. Pitt cause and pretence
   for changing his ground.

   "The Marquis of Landsdown is unconnected either with the Ministry or the
   opposition. His politics is distinct from both. This plan is a sort of
   armed neutrality which has many advocates. In conversation with me he
   reprobated the conduct of the Ministry towards France last year as
   operating to `cut the throat of confidence' (this was his expression)
   between France and England at a time when there was a fair opportunity of
   improving it.

   "The enmity of this country against Russia is as bitter as it ever was
   against America, and is carried to every pitch of abuse and vulgarity.
   What I hear in conversations exceeds what may be seen in the newspapers.
   They are sour and mortified at every success she acquires, and voraciously
   believe and rejoice in the most improbable accounts and rumours to the
   contrary. You may mention this to Mr. Simelin on any terms you please for
   you cannot exceed the fact.

   "There are those who amuse themselves here in the hopes of managing Spain.
   The notification which the Marquis del Campo made last year to the British
   Cabinet, is perhaps the only secret kept in this country. Mr. B[urke]
   tells me that the opposition knows nothing of it. They all very freely
   admit that if the Combined fleets had had thirty or forty thousand land
   forces, when they came up the channel last war, there was nothing in
   England to oppose their landing, and that such a measure would have been
   fatal to their resources, by at least a temporary destruction of national
   credit. This is the point on which; this country is most impressible. Wars
   carried on at a distance, they care but little about, and seem always
   disposed to enter into them. It is bringing the matter home to them that
   makes them fear and feel, for their weakest part is at home. This I take
   to be the reason of the attention they are paying to Spain; for while
   France and Spain make a common cause and start together, they may easily
   overawe this country.

   "I intended sending this letter by Mr. Parker, but he goes by the way of
   Holland, and as I do not chuse to send it by the English Post, I shall
   desire Mr. Bartholemy to forward it to you.

   "Remember me with much affection to the Marquis de la Fayette. This letter
   will serve for two letters. Whether I am in London or the country any
   letter to me at Mr. Whiteside's, Merchant, No. 13 Broad Street Buildings,
   will come safe. My compliments to Mr., Short."

   "LONDON, September 15.

   I have not heard of Mr. [Lewis] Littlepage since I left Paris, -- if you
   have, I shall be glad to know it. As he dined sometimes at Mr. Neckar's,
   he under took to describe the Bridge to him. Mr. Neckar very readily
   conceived it. If you have an opportunity of seeing Mr. Neckar, and see it
   convenient to renew the subject, you might mention that I am going
   forward, with an experiment arch. Mr. Le Couteulx desired me to examine
   the construction of the Albion Steam Mills erected by Bolton and Watt. I
   have not yet written to him because I had nothing certain to write about.
   I have talked with Mr. Rumsey, who is here, upon this matter, and who
   appears to me to be master of that subject, and who has procured a model
   of the Mill, which is worked originally from the steam. . . . When you see
   Mr. Le Roy please to present my compliments. I hope to realize the opinion
   of the Academy on the Model, in which case I shall give the Academy the
   proper information. We have no certain accounts here of the arrangement of
   the new Ministry. The papers mention Count St. Preist for Foreign Affairs.
   When you see him please to present my compliments. . . . Please to present
   my compliments to M. and Madame De Corney."

   "LONDON, December 16.

   "That the King is insane is now old news. He yet continues in the same
   state, and the Parliament are on the business of appointing a Regent. The
   Dukes of York and Gloucester have both made speeches in the house of
   Peers. An embarrassing question, whether the Prince of Wales has a right
   in himself by succession during the incapacity of his father, or whether
   the right must derive to him thro' Parliament, has been agitated in both
   Houses. [Illegible] and the speeches of York and Gloucester of avoiding
   the question. This day is fixt for bringing the matter on in the house of
   Commons. A change of Ministry is expected, and I believe determined on.
   The Duke of Portland and his friends will in all probability come in. I
   shall be exceedingly glad to hear from you, and to know if you have
   received my letters, and also when you intend setting off for America, or
   whether you intend to visit England before you go. In case of change of
   Ministry here there are certain matters I shall be glad to see you upon.
   Remember me to the Marquis de la Fayette. We hear good things from France,
   and I sincerely wish them all well and happy. Remember me to Mr. Short and
   Mr. Mazzei.106

   "LONDON, Jan. 15, 1789.

   "My last letter requested to know if you had any thoughts of coming to
   England before you sailed to America. There will certainly be a change of
   ministry, and probably some change of measures, and it might not be
   inconvenient if you could know before your sailing, for the information of
   the new Congress, what measures the new Ministry here intended to pursue
   or adopt with respect to commercial arrangements with America. I am in
   some intimacy with Mr. Burke, and after the new ministry are formed he has
   proposed to introduce me to them. The Duke of Portland, at whose seat in
   the country I was a few days last summer, will be at the head of the
   Treasury, and Mr. Fox Secretary for Foreign Affairs. The King continues, I
   believe, as mad as ever. It appears that he has amassed several millions
   of money, great part of which is in foreign funds. He had made a Will,
   while he had his senses, and devised it among his children, but a second
   Will has been produced, made since he was mad, dated the 25th of Oct., in
   which he gives his property to the Queen. This will probably produce much
   dispute, as it is attended with many suspicious circumstances. It came out
   in the examination of the physicians, that one of them, Dr. Warrens, on
   being asked the particular time of his observing the King's insanity, said
   the twenty-second of October, and some influence has been exerted to
   induce him to retract that declaration, or to say that the insanity was
   not so much as to prevent him making a Will, which he has refused to do

   "LONDON, February 16.

   "Your favour of the 23d December continued to the -- of Janry. came safe
   to hand, -- for which I thank you. I begin this without knowing of any
   opportunity of conveyance, and shall follow the method of your letter by
   writing on till an opportunity offers.

   "I thank you for the many and judicious observations about my bridge. I am
   exactly in your Ideas as you will perceive by the following account. -- I
   went to the Iron Works the latter end of Octr. My intention at the time of
   writing to you was to construct an experiment arch of 250 feet, but in the
   first place, the season was too far advanced to work out of doors and an
   arch of that extent could not be worked within doors, and nextly, there
   was a prospect of a real Bridge being wanted on the spot of go feet
   extent. The person who appeared disposed to erect a Bridge is Mr. Foljambe
   nephew to the late Sir George Saville, and member in the last Parliament
   for Yorkshire. He lives about three miles from the works, and the River
   Don runs in front of his house, over which there is an old ill constructed
   Bridge which he wants to remove. These circumstances determined me to
   begin an arch of 90 feet with an elevation of 5 feet. This extent I could
   manage within doors by working half the arch at a time. . . . A great part
   of our time, as you will naturally suppose was taken up in preparations,
   but after we began to work we went on rapidly, and that without any
   mistake, or anything to alter or amend. The foreman of the works is a
   Relation to the Proprietors, an excellent mechanic and who fell into all
   my Ideas with great ease and penetration. I staid at the works till one
   half the Rib, 45 feet, was compleated and framed horizontally together and
   came up to London at the meeting of Parliament on the 4th of December. The
   foreman, whom, as I told him, I should appoint "President of the Board of
   Works, in my absence" wrote me word that he has got the other half
   together with much less trouble than the first. He is now preparing for
   erecting and I for returning.

   "February 26.

   "A few days ago I received a letter from Mr. Foljambe in which he says: 'I
   saw the Rib of your Bridge. In point of elegance and beauty, it far
   exceeded my expectations and is certainly beyond any thing I ever saw.' --
   My model and myself had many visitors while I was at the works. A few days
   after I got there, Lord Fitz-William, heir to the Marquis of Rockingham,
   came with Mr. Burke. The former gave the workmen five guineas and invited
   me to Wentworth House, a few miles distant from the works, where I went,
   and staid a few days.

   "This Bridge I expect will bring forth something greater, but in the
   meantime I feel like a Bird from its nest and wishing most anxiously to
   return. Therefore, as soon as I can bring any thing to bear, I shall
   dispose of the contract and bid adieu. I can very truly say that my mind
   is not at home.

   "I am very much rejoiced at the account you give me of the state of
   affairs in France. I feel exceedingly interested in the happiness of that
   nation. They are now got or getting into the right way, and the present
   reign will be more Immortalized in France than any that ever preceded it.
   They have all died away, forgotten in the common mass of things, but this
   will be to France like an Anno Mundi, or an Anno Domini. The happiness of
   doing good and the Pride of doing great things unite themselves in this
   business. But as there are two kinds of Pride -- the little and the great,
   the privileged orders will in some degree be governed by this Division.

   "Those of little pride (I mean little-minded pride) will be schismatical,
   and those of the great pride will be orthodox, with respect to the States
   General. Interest will likewise have some share, and could this operate
   freely it would arrange itself on the orthodox side. To enrich a Nation is
   to enrich the individuals which compose it. To enrich the farmer is to
   enrich the farm -- and consequently the Landlord; -- for whatever the
   farmer is, the farm will be. The richer the subject, the richer the
   revenue, because the consumption from which Taxes are raised is in
   proportion to the abilities of people to consume; therefore the most
   effectual method to raise both the revenue and the rental of a country is
   to raise the condition of the people, -- or that order known in france by
   the Tiers Etat. But I ought to ask pardon for entering into reasonings in
   a letter to you, and only do it because I like the subject.

   "I observe in all the companies I go into the impression which the present
   circumstances of France has upon this Country. An internal Alliance in
   France [between Throne and People] is an alliance which England never
   dreamed of, and which she most dreads. Whether she will be better or worse
   tempered afterwards I cannot judge of, but I believe she will be more
   cautious in giving offence. She is likewise impressed with an Idea that a
   negotiation is on foot between the King [Louis XVI.] and the Emperor for
   adding Austrian Flanders to France. This appears to me such a probable
   thing, and may be rendered so conducive to the interest and good of all
   the parties concerned, that I am inclined to give it credit and wish it
   success. I hope then to see the Scheld opened, for it is a sin to refuse
   the bounties of nature. On these matters I shall be glad of your opinion.
   I think the States General of Holland could not be in earnest when they
   applied to France for the payment of the quota to the Emperor. All things
   considered to request it was meanness, and to expect it absurdity. I am
   more inclined to think they made it an opportunity to find how they stood
   with France. Absalom (I think it was) set fire to his brother's field of
   corn to bring on a conversation.

   "March 12.

   "With respect to Political matters here, the truth is, the people are
   fools. They have no discernment into principles and consequences. Had Mr.
   Pitt proposed a National Convention, at the time of the King's insanity,
   he had done right; but instead of this he has absorbed the right of the
   Nation into a right of Parliament, -- one house of which (the Peers) is
   hereditary in its own right, and over which the people have no controul
   (not so much as they have over their King;) and the other elective by only
   a small part of the Nation. Therefore he has lessened instead of increased
   the rights of the people; but as they have not sense enough to see it,
   they have been huzzaing him. There can be no fixed principles of
   government, or anything like a constitution in a country where the
   Government can alter itself, or one part of it supply the other.

   "Whether a man that has been so compleatly mad as not to be managed but by
   force and the mad shirt can ever be confided in afterwards as a reasonable
   man, is a matter I have very little opinion of. Such a circumstance, in my
   estimation, if mentioned, ought to be a perpetual disqualification.

   "The Emperor I am told has entered a caveat against the Elector of Hanover
   (not the electoral vote) for King of the Romans. John Bull, however, is
   not so mad as he was, and a message has been manufactured for him to
   Parliament in which there is nothing particular. The Treaty with Prussia
   is not yet before Parliament but is to be.

   "Had the Regency gone on and the new administration been formed I should
   have been able to communicate some matters of business to you, both with
   respect to America and France; as an interview for that purpose was agreed
   upon and to take place as soon as the persons who were to fill the offices
   should succeed. I am the more confidential with those persons, as they are
   distinguished by the name of the Blue & Buff, -- a dress taken up during
   the American War, and is the undress uniform of General Washington with
   Lapels which they still wear107. But, at any rate, I do not think it is
   worth while for Congress to appoint any Minister to this Court. The
   greater distance Congress observes on this point the better. It will be
   all money thrown away to go to any expence about it -- at least during the
   present reign. I know the nation well, and the line of acquaintance I am
   in enables me to judge better than any other American can judge --
   especially at a distance. If Congress should have any business to state to
   the Government here, it can be easily done thro' their Minister at Paris
   -- but the seldomer the better.

   I believe I am not so much in the good graces of the Marquis of Landsdowne
   as I used to be -- I do not answer his purpose. He was always talking of a
   sort of reconnection of England and America, and my coldness and reserve
   on this subject checked communication."

   "LONDON, April 10.

   "The King continues in his amended state, but Dr. Willis, his son, and
   attendants, are yet about his person. He has not been to Parliament nor
   made any public appearance, but he has fixed the 23d April for a public
   thanks giving, and he is to go in great Parade to offer up his Devotions
   at St. Paul's on that day. Those about him have endeavoured to dissuade
   him from this ostentatious pilgrimage, most probably from an apprehension
   of some effect it may have upon him, but he persists . ... The acts for
   regulating the trade with America are to be continued as last year. A
   paper from the Privy Council respecting the American fly is before
   Parliament. I had some conversation with Sir Joseph Banks upon this
   subject, as he was the person whom the Privy Council referred to. I told
   him that the Hessian fly attacked only the green plant, and did not exist
   in the dry rain. He said that with respect to the Hessian fly, they had no
   apprehension, but it was the weevil they alluded to. I told him the weevil
   had always more or less been in the wheat countries of America, and that
   if the prohibition was on that account it was as necessary fifty or sixty
   years ago, as now; that I believe it was only a political manoeuvre of the
   Ministry to please the landed interest, as a balance for prohibiting the
   exportation of wool to please the manufacturing interest. He did not
   reply, and as we are on very sociable terms I went farther by saying --
   The English ought not to complain of the non-payment of Debts from America
   while they prohibit the means of payment.

   "I suggest to you a thought on this subject. The debts due before the war,
   ought to be distinguished from the debts contracted since, and all and
   every mode of payment and remittance under which they have been discharged
   at the time they were contracted ought to accompany those Debts, so long
   as any of them shall continue unpaid; because the circumstances of payment
   became united with the debt, and cannot be separated by subsequent acts of
   one side only. If this was taken up in America, and insisted on as a right
   co-eval with and inseparable from those Debts, it would force some of the
   restrictions here to give way.

   "You speak very truly of this country when you say `that they are
   slumbering under a half reformation of Politics and religion, and cannot
   be excited by any thing they hear or see to question the remains of
   prejudice.' Their ignorance on some matters, is unfathomable, for instance
   the Bank of England discount Bills at 5 p cent, but a proposal is talked
   of for discounting at 4  1/2; and the reason given is the vast quantity of
   money, and that money of the good houses discounts at 4  1/2; from this
   they deduce the great ability and credit of the nation. Whereas the
   contrary is the case. This money is all in paper, and the quantity is
   greater than the object to circulate it upon, and therefore shows that the
   market is glutted, and consequently the ability for farther paper
   excretions is lessened. -- If a war should ever break out, between the
   countries again, this is the spot where it ought to be prosecuted, they
   neither feel nor care for any thing at a distance, but are frightened and
   spiritless at every thing which happens at home. The Combined fleet coming
   up the Channel, Paul Jones, and the Mob of 1738, are the dreadful eras of
   this country. But for national puffing none equals them. The addresses
   which have been presented are stuffed with nonsense of this kind. One of
   them published in the London Gazette and presented by a Sir William
   Appleby begins thus, 'Britain, the Queen of Isles, the pride of Nations,
   the Arbitress of Europe, perhaps of the world,' . . . On the receipt of
   your last, I went to Sir Joseph Banks to inform him of your having heard
   from Ledyard, from Grand Cairo, but found he had a letter from him of the
   same date. Sir Joseph is one of the society for promoting that
   undertaking. He has an high opinion of Ledyard, and thinks him the only
   man fitted for such an exploration. As you may probably hear of Ledyard by
   accounts that may not reach here, Sir Joseph will be obliged to you to
   communicate to him any matters respecting him that may come to you (Sir
   Joseph Banks, Bart., Soho Square) . . . .

   "While writing this I am informed that the Minister has had a conference
   with some of the American creditors, and proposed to them to assume the
   debts and give them ten shillings on the pound -- the conjecture is that
   he means, when the new Congress is established, to demand the payment. If
   you are writing to General Washington, it may not be amiss to mention this
   -- and if I hear farther on the matter I will inform you108. But, as being
   a money matter it cannot come forward but thro' Parliament, there will be
   notice given of the business. This would be a proper time to show that the
   British Acts since the Peace militate against the payment by narrowing the
   means by which those debts might have been paid when they were contracted,
   and which ought to be considered as constituant parts of the contract."

   "June 17

   "I received your last to the 21st May. I am just now informed of Messrs.
   Parker and Cutting setting off tomorrow morning for Paris by whom this
   will be delivered to you. Nothing new is showing here. The trial of
   Hastings, and the Examination of evidence before the house of Commons into
   the Slave Trade still continue.

   "I wrote Sir Joseph Banks an account of my Experiment Arch. In his answer
   he informs me of its being read before the Royal Society who expressed
   'great satisfaction at the Communication.'   'I expect' says Sir Joseph
   'many improvements from your Countrymen who think with vigor, and are in a
   great measure free from those shackles of Theory which are imposed 'on the
   minds of our people before they are capable of exerting their mental
   faculties to advantage.' In the close of his letter he says:   'We have
   lost poor Ledyard. He had agreed with certain Moors to conduct hint to
   Sennar. The time for their departure was arrived. when he found himself
   ill, and took a large dose of Emetic Tartar; burst a blood-vessel in the
   operation, which carried him off in three days. We sincerely lament his
   loss, as the papers we have received from him are full of those emanations
   of spirit, which taught you to construct a Bridge without any reference to
   the means used by your predecessors in that art.'   I have wrote to the
   Walkers and proposed to them to manufacture me a compleat Bridge and erect
   it in London, and afterwards put it up to sale. I do this by way of
   bringing forward a Bridge over the Thames -- which appears to me the most
   advantageous of all objects. For, if only a fifth of the persons, at a
   half penny each, pass over a new Bridge as now pass over the old ones the
   tolls will pay 25 per Cent besides what will arise from carriage and
   horses. Mrs. Williams tells me that her letters from America mention Dr.
   Franklin as being exceedingly ill. I have been to see the Cotton Mills, --
   the Potteries -- the Steel furnaces -- Tin plate manufacture -- White lead
   manufacture. All those things might be easily carried on in America. I saw
   a few days ago part of a hand bill of what was called a geometrical
   wheelbarrow, -- but cannot find where it is to be seen. The Idea is one of
   those that needed only to be thought of, -- for it is very easy to
   conceive that if a wheelbarrow, as it is called, be driven round a piece
   of land, -- a sheet of paper may be placed in it -- so as to receive by
   the tracings of a Pencil, regulated by a little Mechanism -- the figure
   and content of the land -- and that neither Theodolite nor chain are
   necessary."

   "ROTHERHAM,  YORKSHIRE, July 13.

   "The Walkers are to find all the materials, and fit and frame them ready
   for erecting, put them on board a vessel & send them to London. I am to
   undertake all expense from that time & to compleat the erecting. We intend
   first to exhibit it and afterwards put it u$ to sale, or dispose of it by
   private contract, and after paying the expences of each party the
   remainder to be equally divided -- one half theirs, the other mine. My
   principal object, in this plan is to open the way for a Bridge over the
   Thames . . . . I shall now have occasion to draw upon some funds I have in
   America. I have one thousand Dollars stock in the Bank at Philadelphia,
   and two years interest due upon it last April, -L-180 in the hands of
   General Morris; -L-40 with Mr. Constable of New York; a house at Borden
   Town, and a farm at New Rochelle. The stock and interest in the Bank,
   which Mr. Willing manages for me, is the easiest negotiated, and full
   sufficient for what I shall want. On this fund I have drawn fifteen
   guineas payable to Mr. Trumbull, tho' I shall not want the money longer
   than till the Exhibition and sale of the Bridge. I had rather draw than
   ask to borrow of any body here. If you go to America this year I shall be
   very glad if you can manage this matter for me, by giving me credit for
   two hundred pounds, on London, and receiving that amount of Mr. Willing. I
   am not acquainted with the method of negotiating money matters, but if you
   can accommodate me in this, and will direct me how the transfer is to be
   made, I shall be much obliged to you. Please direct to me under cover to
   Mr. Trumbull. I have some thoughts of coming over to France for two or
   three weeks, as I shall have little to do here until the Bridge is ready
   for erecting."

   "September 15.

   "When I left Paris I was to return with the Model, but I could now bring
   over a compleat Bridge. Tho I have a slender opinion of myself for
   executive business, I think, upon the whole that I have managed this
   matter tolerable well. With no money to spare for such an undertaking I am
   the sole Patentee here, and connected with one of the first and best
   established houses in the Nation. But absent from America I feel a craving
   desire to return and I can scarcely forbear weeping at the thoughts of
   your going and my staying behind.

   "Accept my dear Sir, my most hearty thanks for your many services and
   friendship. Remember me with an overflowing affection to my dear America
   -- the people and the place. Be so kind to shake hands with them for me,
   and tell our beloved General Washington, and my old friend Dr. Franklin
   how much I long to see them. I wish you would spend a day with General
   Morris of Morrisania, and present my best wishes to all the family. -- But
   I find myself wandering into a melancholy subject that will be tiresome to
   read, -- so wishing you a prosperous passage, and a happy meeting with all
   your friends and mine, I remain yours affectionately, etc.

   "I shall be very glad to hear from you when you arrive. If you direct for
   me to the care of Mr. Benjamin Vaughn it will find me. -- Please present
   my friendship to Captain Nicholson and family of New York, and to Mr. and
   Mrs. Few.

   "September 18.

   "I this moment receive yours of ye 13 int. which being Post Night, affords
   me the welcome opportunity of acknowledging it. I wrote you on the 15th by
   post but I was so full of the thoughts of America and my American friends
   that I forgot France.

   "The people of this Country speak very differently on the affairs of
   France. The mass of them, so far as I can collect, say that 'France is a
   much freer Country than England. The Peers, the Bishops, &c. say the
   National Assembly has gone too far. There are yet in this country, very
   considerable remains of the feudal System which people did not see till
   the revolution in France placed it before their eyes. While the multitude
   here could be terrified with the cry and apprehension of Arbitrary power,
   wooden shoes, popery, and such like stuff, they thought themselves by
   comparison an extraordinary free people; but this bugbear now loses its
   force, and they appear to me to be turning their eyes towards the
   Aristocrats of their own Nation. This is a new mode of conquering, and I
   think it will have its effect.

   "I am looking out for a place to erect my Bridge, within some of the
   Squares would be very convenient. I had thought of Soho Square, where Sir
   Joseph Banks lives, but he is now in Lincolnshire. I expect it will be
   ready for erecting and in London by the latter end of October. Whether I
   shall then sell it in England or bring it over to Paris, and re-erect it
   there, I have not determined in my mind. In order to bring any kind of a
   contract forward for the Seine, it is necessary it should be seen, and, as
   economy will now be a principle in the Government, it will have a better
   chance than before.

   "If you should pass thro' Borden Town in Jersey, which is not out of your
   way from Philadelphia to New York, I shall be glad you would enquire out
   my particular friend Col. Kirkbride. You will be very much pleased with
   him. His house is my home when in that part of the Country -- and it was
   there that I made the Model of my Bridge."

                                  CHAPTER  XIX

                            THE KEY OF THE BASTILLE 
                                  [1789-1790]

   IN June, 1777, the Emperor Joseph II. visited his sister, the Queen of
   France, and passed a day at Nantes. The Count de Menou, commandant of the
   place, pointed out in the harbor, among the flags raised in his honor, one
   bearing thirteen stars. The Emperor turned away his eyes, saying: "I
   cannot look on that; my own profession is to be royalist."

   Weber, foster-brother of Marie Antoinette, who reports the Emperor's
   remark, recognized the fate of France in those thirteen stars. That
   republic, he says, was formed by the subjects of a King, aided by another
   King. These French armies, mingling their flags with those of America,
   learned a new language. Those warriors, the flower of their age, went out
   Frenchmen and returned Americans. They returned to a court, but decorated
   with republican emblems and showing the scars of Liberty. Lafayette, it is
   said, had in his study a large carton, splendidly framed, in two columns:
   on one was inscribed the American Declaration of Independence; the other
   was blank, awaiting the like Declaration of France109.

   The year 1789 found France afflicted with a sort of famine, its finances
   in disorder; while the people, their eyes directed to the new world by the
   French comrades of Washington, beheld that great chieftain inaugurated as
   president of a prosperous republic. The first pamphlet of Thomas Paine,
   expurgated in translation of anti-monarchism, had been widely circulated,
   and John Adams (1779) found himself welcomed in France as the supposed
   author of "Common Sense." The lion's skin dropped from Paine's disgusted
   enemy, and when, ten years later, the lion himself became known in Paris,
   he was hailed with enthusiasm. This was in the autumn of 1789, when Paine
   witnessed the scenes that ushered in the "crowned republic," from which he
   hoped so much. Jefferson had sailed in September, and Paine was recognized
   by Lafayette and other leaders as the representative of the United States.
   To him Lafayette gave for presentation to Washington the Key of the
   destroyed Bastille, ever since visible at Mount Vernon, -- symbol of the
   fact that, in Paine's words, "the principles of America opened the
   Bastille."

   But now an American enemy of Paine's principles more inveterate than Adams
   found himself similarly eclipsed in Paris by the famous author. Early in
   1789 Gouverneur Morris came upon the stage of events in Europe. He was
   entrusted by the President with a financial mission which, being secret,
   swelled him to importance in the imagination of courtiers. At Jefferson's
   request Gouverneur Morris posed to Houdon for the bust of Washington; and
   when, to Morris' joy, Jefferson departed, he posed politically as
   Washington to the eyes of Europe. He was scandalized that Jefferson should
   retain recollections of the Declaration of Independence strong enough to
   desire for France "a downright republican form of government"; and how it
   happened that under Jefferson's secretaryship of state this man, whom even
   Hamilton pronounced "an exotic" in a republic, was presently appointed
   Minister to France, is a mystery remaining to be solved.

   Morris had a "high old time" in Europe. Intimacy with Washington secured
   him influence with Lafayette, and the fine ladies of Paris, seeking
   official favors for relatives and lovers, welcomed him to the boudoirs,
   baths, and bedrooms to which his diary now introduces the public.

   It was but natural that such a man, just as he had been relieved of the
   overlaying Jefferson, should try to brush Paine aside. On January 26,
   1790, he enters in his diary: 

   "To-day, at half-past three, I go to M. de Lafayette's. He tells me that
   he wishes to have a meeting of Mr. Short, Mr. Paine, and myself, to
   consider their judiciary, because his place imposes on him the necessity
   of being right. I tell him that Paine can do him no good, for that,
   although he has an excellent pen to write, he has but an indifferent head
   to think."

   Eight years before, Gouverneur Morris had joined Robert Morris in
   appealing to the author to enlighten the nation on the subject of finance
   and the direction of the war. He had also confessed to Paine that he had
   been duped by Silas Deane, who, by the way, was now justifying all that
   Paine had said of him by hawking his secret letter-books in London. Now,
   in Paris, Morris discovers that Paine has but an indifferent head to
   think110.

   Gouverneur Morris was a fascinating man. His diary and letters, always
   entertaining, reveal the secret of his success in twisting the
   Constitution and Jefferson and Washington around his fingers in several
   important junctures. To Paine also he was irresistible. His cordial
   manners disarm suspicion, and we presently find the author pouring into
   the ear of his secret detractor what state secrets he learns in London.

   On March 17, 1790, Paine left Paris to see after his Bridge in Yorkshire,
   now near completion. On the day before, he writes to a friend in
   Philadelphia how prosperously everything is going on in France, where
   Lafayette is acting the part of a Washington; how the political
   reformation is sure to influence England; and how he longs for America. 

   "I wish most anxiously to see my much loved America. It is the country
   from whence all reformation must originally spring. I despair of seeing an
   abolition of the infernal traffic in negroes. We must push that matter
   further on your side of the water. I wish that a few well-instructed could
   be sent among their brethren in bondage; for until they are able to take
   their own part nothing will be done."111

   On his arrival in London he has the happiness of meeting his old friend
   General Morris of Morrisania, and his wife. Gouverneur is presently over
   there, to see his brother; and in the intervals of dancing attendance at
   the opera on titled ladies -- among them Lady Dunmore, whose husband
   desolated the Virginia coast, -- he gets Paine's confidences112. Poor
   Paine was an easy victim of any show of personal kindness, especially when
   it seemed like the magnanimity of a political opponent.

   The historic sense may recognize a picturesque incident in the selection
   by Lafayette of Thomas Paine to convey the Key of the Bastille to
   Washington. In the series of intellectual and moral movements which
   culminated in the French Revolution, the Bastille was especially the
   prison of Paine's forerunners, the writers, and the place where their
   books were burned. "The gates of the Bastille," says Rocquain, "were
   opened wide for abbes, savants, brilliant intellects, professors of the
   University and doctors of the Sorbonne, all accused of writing or reciting
   verses against the King, casting reflections on the Government, or
   publishing books in favor of Deism, and contrary to good morals. Diderot
   was one of the first arrested, and it was during his detention that he
   conceived the plan of his 'Encyclopedia.'113

   The coming Key was announced to Washington with the following letters:

   "LONDON, May 1, 1790.

   "SIR,

   "Our very good friend the Marquis de la Fayette [Lafayette] has entrusted
   to my care the Key of the Bastille, and a drawing, handsomely framed,
   representing the demolition of that detestable prison, as a present to
   your Excellency, of which his letter will more particularly inform114. I
   feel myself happy in being the person thro' whom the Marquis has conveyed
   this early trophy of the Spoils of despotism, and the first ripe fruits of
   American principles transplanted into Europe, to his great master and
   patron. When he mentioned to me the present he intended you, my heart
   leaped with joy. It is something so truly in character that no remarks can
   illustrate it, and is more happily expressive of his remembrance of his
   American friends than any letters can convey. That the principles of
   America opened the Bastille is not to be doubted, and therefore the Key
   comes to the right place.

   "I beg leave to suggest to your Excellency the propriety of congratulating
   the King and Queen of France (for they have been our friends,) and the
   National Assembly, on the happy example they are giving to Europe. You
   will see by the King's speech, which I enclose, that he prides himself on
   being at the head of the Revolution; and I am certain that such a
   congratulation will be well received and have a good effect.

   "I should rejoice to be the direct bearer of the Marquis's present to your
   Excellency, but I doubt I shall not be able to see my much loved America
   till next Spring. I shall therefore send it by some American vessel to New
   York. I have permitted no drawing to be taken here, tho it has been often
   requested, as I think there is a propriety that it should first be
   presented. B[ut] Mr. West wishes Mr. Trumbull to make a painting of the
   presentation of the Key to you.

   "I returned from France to London about five weeks ago, and I am engaged
   to return to Paris when the Constitution shall be proclaimed, and to carry
   the American flag in the procession. I have not the least doubt of the
   final and compleat success of the French Revolution. Little Ebbings and
   Flowings, for and against, the natural companions of revolutions,
   sometimes appear; but the full current of it, is, in my opinion, as fixed
   as the Gulph Stream.

   "I have manufactured a Bridge (a single arch) of one hundred and ten feet
   span, and five feet high from the cord of the arch. It is now on board a
   vessel coming from Yorkshire to London, where it is to be erected. I see
   nothing yet to disappoint my hopes of its being advantageous to me. It is
   this only which keeps me [in] Europe, and happy shall I be when I shall
   have it in my power to return to America. I hove not heard of Mr.
   Jefferson since he sailed, except of his arrival. As I have always
   indulged the belief of having many friends in America, or rather no
   enemies, I have [mutilated] to mention but my affectionate [mutilated] and
   am Sir with the greatest respect,

   "If any of my friends are disposed to favor me with a letter it will come
   to hand by addressing it to the care of Benjamin Vaughn Esq., Jeffries
   Square, London."

   "LONDON, May 31, 1790.

   "SIR,

   "By Mr. James Morris, who sailed in the May Packet, I transmitted you a
   letter from the Marquis de la Fayette [Lafayette], at the same time
   informing you that the Marquis had entrusted to my charge the Key of the
   Bastille, and a drawing of that prison, as a present to your Excellency.
   Mr. J. Rutledge, jun'r, had intended coming in the ship `Marquis de la
   Fayette,' and I had chosen that opportunity for the purpose of
   transmitting the present; but, the ship not sailing at the time appointed,
   Mr. Rutledge takes his passage on the Packet, and I have committed to his
   care that trophie of Liberty which I know it will give you pleasure to
   receive. The french Revolution is not only compleat but triumphant, and
   the envious despotism of this nation is compelled to own the magnanimity
   with which it has been conducted.

   "The political hemisphere is again clouded by a dispute between England
   and Spain, the circumstances of which you will hear before this letter can
   arrive. A Messenger was sent from hence the 6th inst. to Madrid with very
   peremptory demands, and to wait there only forty-eight hours. His return
   has been expected for two or three days past. I was this morning at the
   Marquis del Campo's but nothing is yet arrived. Mr. Rutledge sets off at
   four o'clock this afternoon, but should any news arrive before the making
   up the mail on Wednesday June 2, I will forward it to you under cover.

   "The views of this Court as well as of the Nation, so far as they extend
   to South America, are not for the purpose of freedom, but conquest. They
   already talk of sending some of the young branches to reign over them, and
   to pay off their national debt with the produce of their Mines. The
   Bondage of those countries will, as far as I can perceive, be prolonged by
   what this Court has in contemplation.

   "My Bridge is arrived and I have engaged a place to erect it in. A little
   time will determine its fate, but I yet see no cause to doubt of its
   success, tho' it is very probable that a War, should it break out, will as
   in all new things prevent its progress so far as regards profits.

   "In the partition in the Box, which contains the Key of the Bastille, I
   have put up half a dozen Razors, manufactured from Cast-steel made at the
   Works where the Bridge was constructed, which I request you to accept as a
   little token from a very grateful heart.

   "I received about a week ago a letter from Mr. G. Clymer. It is dated the
   4th February, but has been travelling ever since. I request you to
   acknowledge it for me and that I will answer it when my Bridge is erected.
   With much affection to all my friends, and many wishes to see them again,
   I am, etc."

   Washington received the Key at New York115, along with this last letter,
   and on August 10, 1790, acknowledges Paine's "agreeable letters." 
    

   "It must, I dare say, give you great pleasure to learn by repeated
   opportunities, that our new government answers its purposes as well as
   could have been reasonably expected, that we are gradually overcoming the
   difficulties which presented in its first organization, and that our
   prospects in general are growing more favorable."

   Paine is said by several biographers to have gone to Paris in the May of
   this year. No doubt he was missed from London, but it was probably because
   he had gone to Thetford, where his mother died about the middle of May.
   Gouverneur Morris reports interviews with him August 8th and 15th, in
   London. The beautiful iron bridge, 110 feet long, had been erected in June
   at Leasing-Green (now Paddington-Green) at the joint expense of Paine and
   Peter Whiteside, an American merchant in London. It was attracting a fair
   number of visitors, at a shilling each, also favorable press notices, and
   all promised well.

   So Paine was free to run over to Paris, where Carlyle mentions him, this
   year, as among the English "missionaries."116 It was a brief visit,
   however, for October finds him again in London, drawn probably by
   intimations of disaster to the interests of his Bridge. Whiteside had
   failed, and his assignees, finding on his books -L-620 debited to Paine's
   Bridge, came upon the inventor for the money; no doubt unfairly, for it
   seems to have been Whiteside' s investment, but Paine, the American
   merchants Cleggett and Murdoch becoming his bail, scraped together the
   money and paid it. Probably he lost through Whiteside's bankruptcy other
   moneys, among them the sum he had deposited to supply his mother with her
   weekly nine shillings. Paine was too much accustomed to straitened means
   to allow this affair to trouble him much. The Bridge exhibition went on
   smoothly enough. Country gentlemen, deputations from riverside towns,
   visited it, and suggested negotiations for utilizing the invention. The
   snug copyright fortune which the author had sacrificed to the American
   cause seemed about to be recovered by the inventor.

   But again the Cause arose before him; he must part from all -- patent
   interests, literary leisure, fine society -- and take the hand of Liberty,
   undowered, but as yet unstained. He must beat his bridge iron into a Key
   that shall unlock the British Bastille, whose walls he sees steadily
   closing around the people.

                              "THE RIGHTS OF MAN" 
                                  [1790-1791]

   EDMUND BURKE'S "Reflexions on the Revolution in France" appeared about
   November 1, 1790. Paine was staying at the Angel Inn, Islington, and there
   immediately began his reply117. With his sentiment for anniversaries, he
   may have begun his work on November 4th, in honor of the English
   Revolution, whose centenary celebration he had witnessed three years
   before. In a hundred years all that had been turned into a more secure
   lease of monarchy. Burke's pamphlet founded on that Revolution a claim
   that the throne represented a perpetual popular franchise. Paine might
   have heard under his window the boys, with their

   "Please to remember 
    The fifth of November,"
   seen their effigy of Guy Fawkes, which in two years his own effigy was to
   replace. But no misgivings of that kind haunted him. For his eyes the
   omens hung over the dark Past; on the horizon a new day was breaking in
   morning stars and stripes. With the inspiration of perfect faith, born of
   the sacrifices that had ended so triumphantly in America, Paine wrote the
   book which, coming from such deep, the deeps answered.

   Although Paine had been revising his religion, much of the orthodox temper
   survived in him; notably, he still required some kind of Satan to bring
   out his full energy. In America it had been George III, duly hoofed and
   horned, at whom his inkstand was hurled; now it is Burke, who appeared
   with all the seductive brilliancy of a fallen Lucifer. No man had been
   more idealized by Paine than Burke. Not only because of his magnificent
   defence of American patriots, but because of his far-reaching exposures of
   despotism, then creeping, snake-like, from one skin to another. At the
   very time that Paine was writing "Common Sense," Burke was pointing out
   that "the power of the crown, almost dead and rotten as prerogative, has
   grown up anew, with much more strength and far less odium, under the name
   of influence." He had given liberalism the sentence: "The forms of a free
   and the ends of an arbitrary government are things not altogether
   incompatible." He had been the intimate friend of Priestley and other
   liberals, and when Paine arrived in 1787 had taken him to his heart and
   home. Paine maintained his faith in Burke after Priestley and Price had
   remarked a change. In the winter of 1789, when the enthusiastic author was
   sending out jubilant missives to Washington and others, announcing the
   glorious transformation of France, he sent one to Burke, who might even
   then have been preparing the attack on France, delivered early in the
   Parliament of 1790. When, soon after his return from Paris, Paine mingled
   with the mourners for their lost leader, he was informed that Burke had
   for some time been a "masked pensioner," to the extent of -L-1,500 per
   annum. This rumor Paine mentioned, and it was not denied, whether because
   true, or because Burke was looking forward to his subsequent pension of
   -L-2,500, is doubtful. Burke's book preceded the events in France which
   caused reaction in the minds of Wordsworth and other thinkers in England
   and America. The French were then engaged in adapting their government to
   the free principles of which Burke himself had long been the eloquent
   advocate. It was not without justice that Erskine charged him with having
   challenged a Revolution in England, by claiming that its hereditary
   monarchy was bound on the people by a compact of the previous century, and
   that, good or bad, they had no power to alter it. The power of Burke's
   pamphlet lay largely in his deftness with the methods of those he
   assailed. He had courted their company, familiarized himself with their
   ideas, received their confidences. This had been especially the case with
   Paine. So there seemed to be a soupc,on of treachery in his subtleties and
   his disclosures.

   But after all he did not know Paine. He had not imagined the completeness
   with which the struggle in America had trained this man in every art of
   controversy. Grappling with Philadelphia Tories, Quakers, reactionists,
   with aristocrats on the one hand and anarchists on the other, Paine had
   been familiarized beyond all men with every deep and by way of the subject
   on which Burke had ventured. Where Burke had dabbled Paine had dived.
   Never did man reputed wise go beyond his depth in such a bowl as when
   Burke appealed to a revolution of 1688 as authoritative. If one revolution
   could be authoritative, why not another? How did the seventeenth century
   secure a monopoly in revolution? If a revolution in one century could
   transfer the throne from one family to another, why might not the same
   power in another transfer it to an elective monarch, or a president, or
   leave it vacant?

   To demolish Burke was the least part of Paine's task. Burke was, indeed,
   already answered by the government established in America, presided over
   by a man to whom the world paid homage. To Washington, Paine's work was
   dedicated. His real design was to write a Constitution for the English
   nation. And to-day the student of political history may find in Burke's
   pamphlet the fossilized, and in Paine's (potentially) the living,
   Constitution of Great Britain.

   For adequacy to a purpose Paine's "Common Sense" and his "Rights of
   Man" have never been surpassed. Washington pronounced the former
   unanswerable, and Burke passed the like verdict on the latter when he said
   that the refutation it deserved was "that of criminal justice." There was
   not the slightest confusion of ideas and aim in this book. In laying down
   first principles of human government, Paine imports no preference of his
   own for one form or another. The people have the right to establish any
   government they choose, be it democracy or monarchy, -- if not hereditary.
   He explains with nicety of consecutive statement that a real Constitution
   must be of the people, and for the people. That is, for the people who
   make it; they have no right, by any hereditary principle, to bind another
   people, unborn. His principle of the rights of man was founded in the
   religious axiom of his age that all men derived existence from a divine
   maker. To say men are born equal means that they are created equal.
   Precedent contradicts precedent, authority is against authority, in all
   our appeals to antiquity, until we reach the time when man came from the
   hands of his maker. "What was he then? Man. Man was his high and only
   title, and a higher cannot be given him." "God said Let us make man in our
   own image." No distinction between men is pointed out. All histories, all
   traditions, of the creation agree as to the unity of man. Generation being
   the mode by which creation is carried forward, every child derives its
   existence from God. "The world is as new to him as it was to the first man
   that existed, and his natural right to it is of the same kind." On these
   natural rights Paine founds man's civil rights. To secure his natural
   rights the individual deposits some of them -- e.g. the right to judge in
   his own cause -- in the common stock of society.

   Paine next proceeds to distinguish governments which have arisen out of
   this social compact from those which have not. Governments are classified
   as founded on -- (1) superstition; (2) power; (3) the common interests of
   society, and the common rights of man: that is, on priestcraft, on
   conquest, on reason. A national constitution is the act of the people
   antecedent to government; a government cannot therefore determine or alter
   the organic law it temporarily represents. Pitt's bill to reform
   Parliament involves the absurdity of trusting an admittedly vitiated body
   to reform itself. The judges are to sit in their own case. "The right of
   reform is in the nation in its original character, and the constitutional
   method would be by a general convention elected for the purpose." The
   organization of the aggregate of rights which individuals concede to
   society, for the security of all rights, makes the Republic. So far as the
   rights have been surrendered to extraneous authority, as of priest-craft,
   hereditary power, or conquest, -- it is Despotism.

   To set forth these general principles was Paine's first design. His next
   aim was to put on record the true and exact history of events in France up
   to the year 1791. This history, partly that of an eyewitness, partly
   obtained from the best men in France -- Lafayette, Danton, Brissot, and
   others, -- and by mingling with the masses, constitutes the most fresh and
   important existing contribution to our knowledge of the movement in its
   early stages. The majority of histories of the French Revolution,
   Carlyle's especially, are vitiated by reason of their inadequate attention
   to Paine's narrative. There had been then few serious outbreaks of the
   mob, but of these Burke had made the most. Paine contends that the
   outrages can no more be charged against the French than the London riots
   of 1780 against the English nation; then retorts that mobs are the
   inevitable consequence of misgovernment. 

   "It is by distortedly exalting some men, that others are distortedly
   debased. A vast mass of mankind are degradedly thrown into the background
   of the human picture, to bring forward, with greater glare, the puppet
   show of state and aristocracy. In the commencement of a revolution, those
   men are rather followers of the camp than of the standard of liberty, and
   have yet to be instructed how to use it."

   Part I. of "The Rights of Man" was printed by Johnson in time for the
   opening of Parliament (February), but this publisher became frightened,
   and only a few copies bearing his name found their way into private hands,
   one of these being in the British Museum. J. S. Jordan, 166 Fleet Street,
   consented to publish it, and Paine, entrusting it to a committee of his
   friends -- William Godwin, Thomas Holcroft, and Thomas Brand Hollistook
   his departure for Paris118. From that city he sent a brief preface which
   appeared with Jordan's first edition, March 13, 1791. Oldys (Chalmers)
   asserts that the work was altered by Jordan. This assertion, in its
   sweeping form, is disproved not only by Holcroft's note to Godwin, but by
   a comparison of the "Johnson" and "Jordan" volumes in the British
   Museum119.

   The preface to which Holcroft alludes is of biographical interest both as
   regards Paine and Burke. As it does not appear in the American edition it
   is here inserted: 

   "From the part Mr. Burke took in the American Revolution, it was natural
   that I should consider him a friend to mankind; and as our acquaintance
   commenced on that ground, it would have been more agreeable to me to have
   had cause to continue in that opinion, than to change it.

   "At the time Mr. Burke made his violent speech last winter in the English
   Parliament against the French Revolution and the National Assembly, I was
   in Paris, and had written him, but a short time before, to inform him how
   prosperously matters were going on. Soon after this I saw his
   advertisement of the Pamphlet he intended to publish. As the attack was to
   be made in a language but little studied, and less understood, in France,
   and as everything suffers by translation, I promised some of the friends
   of the Revolution in that country, that whenever Mr. Burke's Pamphlet came
   forth, I would answer it. This appeared to me the more necessary to be
   done, when I saw the flagrant misrepresentations which Mr. Burke's
   Pamphlet contains; and that while it is an outrageous abuse of the French
   Revolution, and the principles of Liberty, it is an imposition on the rest
   of the world.

   "I am the more astonished and disappointed at this conduct in Mr. Burke,
   as (from the circumstance I am going to mention) I had formed other
   expectations.

   "I had seen enough of the miseries of war, to wish it might never more
   have existence in the world, and that some other mode might be found out
   to settle the differences that should occasionally arise in the
   neighbourhood of nations. This certainly might be done if Courts were
   disposed to set honestly about it, or if countries were enlightened enough
   not to be made the dupes of Courts. The people of America had been bred up
   in the same prejudices against France, which at that time characterized
   the people of England; but experience and an acquaintance with the French
   Nation have most effectually shown to the Americans the falsehood of those
   prejudices; and I do not believe that a more cordial and confidential
   intercourse exists between any two countries than between America and
   France.

   "When I came to France in the spring of 1787, the Archbishop of Thoulouse
   was then Minister, and at that time highly esteemed. I became much
   acquainted with the private Secretary of that Minister, a man of an
   enlarged benevolent heart; and found that his sentiments and my own
   perfectly agreed with respect to the madness of war, and the wretched
   impolicy of two nations, like England and France, continually worrying
   each other, to no other end than that of a mutual increase of burdens and
   taxes. That I might be assured I had not misunderstood him, nor he me, I
   put the substance of our opinions into writing, and sent it to him;
   subjoining a request, that if I should see among the people of England any
   disposition to cultivate a better understanding between the two nations
   than had hitherto prevailed, how far I might be authorised to say that the
   same disposition prevailed on the part of France? He answered me by letter
   in the most unreserved manner, and that not for himself only, but for the
   Minister, with whose knowledge the letter was declared to be written.

   "I put this letter into the hands of Mr. Burke almost three years ago, and
   left it with him, where it still remains, hoping, and at the same time
   naturally expecting, from the opinion I had conceived of him, that he
   would find some opportunity of making a good use of it, for the purpose of
   removing those errors and prejudices which two neighbouring nations, from
   the want of knowing each other, had entertained, to the injury of both.

   "When the French Revolution broke out, it certainly afforded to Mr. Burke
   an opportunity of doing some good, had he been disposed to it; instead of
   which, no sooner did he see the old prejudices wearing away, than he
   immediately began sowing the seeds of a new inveteracy, as if he were
   afraid that England and France would cease to be enemies. That there are
   men in all countries who get their living by war, and by keeping up the
   quarrels of Nations, is as shocking as it is true; but when those who are
   concerned in the government of a country, make it their study to sow
   discord, and cultivate prejudices between Nations, it becomes the more
   unpardonable.

   "With respect to a paragraph in this work alluding to Mr. Burke's having a
   pension, the report has been some time in circulation, at least two
   months; and as a person is often the last to hear what concerns him the
   most to know, I have mentioned it, that Mr. Burke may have an opportunity
   of contradicting the rumour, if he thinks proper."

   "The Rights of Man" produced a great impression from the first. It
   powerfully reinforced the "Constitutional Society," formed seven years
   before, which Paine had joined. The book was adopted as their new Magna
   Charta. Their enthusiasm was poured forth on March 23d in resolutions
   which Daniel Williams, secretary, is directed to transmit "to all our
   corresponding Constitutional Societies in England, Scotland, and France."
   In Ireland the work was widely welcomed. I find a note that "at a numerous
   meeting of the Whigs of the Capital [Dublin] on Tuesday the 5th of April,
   Hugh Crothers in the chair," a committee was appointed to consider the
   most effectual mode of disseminating Mr. Paine's pamphlet on "The Rights
   of Man."120

   In order to be uniform with Burke's pamphlet the earlier editions of "The
   Rights of Man," were in the three-shilling style. The proceeds enriched
   the Society for Constitutional Information, though Paine had been drained
   of funds by the failure of Whiteside. Gouverneur Morris, as appears by the
   subjoined extracts from his diary, is disgusted with Paine's "wretched
   apartments" in Paris, in which, however, the reader may see something
   finer than the diarist's luxury, which the author might have rivalled with
   the means devoted to his Cause. This was perhaps what Morris and Paine's
   friend Hodges agreed in deeming a sort of lunacy. 

   "April 8.

   "Return home, and read the answer of Paine to Burke's book; there are good
   things in the answer as well as in the book. Paine calls on me. He says
   that he found great difficulty in prevailing on any bookseller to publish
   his book; that it is extremely popular in England, and, of course, the
   writer, which he considers as one of the many uncommon revolutions of this
   age. He turns the conversation on times of yore, and as he mentions me
   among those who were his enemies, I frankly acknowledge that I urged his
   dismissal from the office he held of secretary to the Committee of Foreign
   Affairs." 

   "April 16.

   "This morning I visit Paine and Mr. Hodges. The former is abroad, the
   latter is in the wretched apartments they occupy. He speaks of Paine as
   being a little mad, which is not improbable." 

   "April 25.

   "This morning Paine calls and tells me that the Marquis de Lafayette has
   accepted the position of head of the National Guards." 

   "May 1.

   "Dine with Montmorin. Bouinville is here. He is just returned from
   England. He tells me that Paine's book works mightily in England."

   Up to this point Paine had, indeed, carried England with him, -- for
   England was at heart with Fox and the Opposition. When Burke made his
   first attack on the French Revolution (February 9, 1790), he was
   repeatedly called to order; and Fox -- with tears, for their long
   friendship was breaking for ever -- overwhelmed Burke with his rebuke.
   Even Pitt did not say a word for him. His pamphlet nine months later was
   ascribed to inspiration of the King, from whom he expected favors; and
   although the madmen under whom the French Revolution fell presently came
   to the support of his case, Burke personally never recovered his place in
   the esteem of England. That the popular instinct was true, and that Burke
   was playing a deeper game than appeared, was afterwards revealed in the
   archives of England and France125.

   There was every reason why Paine's reply should carry liberal statesmen
   with him. His pamphlet was statesmanlike. The French Constitution at that
   time was the inchoate instrument beginning with the "Declaration of
   Rights," adopted on Lafayette's proposal (August 26, 1789), and containing
   provisions contrary to Paine's views. It recognized the reigning house,
   and made its executive power hereditary. Yet so free was Paine from
   pedantry, so anxious for any peaceful advance, that it was at the expected
   inauguration of this Constitution he had consented to bear the American
   flag, and in his reply to Burke he respects the right of a people to
   establish even hereditary executive, the right of constitutional reform
   being retained. "The French constitution distinguishes between the king
   and the sovereign; it considers the station of the king as official, and
   places sovereignty in the nation." In the same practical way he deals with
   other survivals in the French Constitution -- such as clericalism, and the
   property qualification for suffrage -- by dwelling on their mitigations,
   while reaffirming his own principles on these points.

   A very important part of Paine's answer was that which related to the
   United States. Burke, the most famous defender of American revolutionists,
   was anxious to separate their movement from that in France. Paine, with
   ample knowledge, proved how largely the uprising in France was due to the
   training of Lafayette and other French officers in America, and to the
   influence of Franklin, who was "not the diplomatist of a court, but of
   man." He also drew attention to the effect of the American State
   Constitutions, which were a grammar of liberty126. He points out that
   under this transatlantic influence French liberalism had deviated from the
   line of its forerunners, -- from Montesquieu, "obliged to divide himself
   between principle and prudence"; Voltaire, "both the flatterer and
   satirist of despotism"; Rousseau, leaving "the mind in love with an object
   without describing the means of possessing it"; Turgot, whose maxims are
   directed to "reform the administration of government rather than the
   government itself." To these high praise is awarded, but they all had to
   be filtered through America.

   And it goes without saying that it was not the reactionary America with
   which John Adams and Gouverneur Morris had familiarized Burke. "The Rights
   of Man" was the first exposition of the republicanism of Jefferson,
   Madison, and Edmund Randolph that ever appeared. And as this republicanism
   was just then in deadly struggle with reaction, the first storm raised by
   Paine's book occurred in America. It was known in America that Paine was
   about to beard the British lion in his den, and to expectant ears the roar
   was heard before its utterance. 

   "Paine's answer to Burke (writes Madison to Jefferson, May 1st) has not
   yet been received here [New York]. The moment it can be got, Freneau tells
   me, it will be published in Child's paper [Daily Advertiser ]. It is said
   that the pamphlet has been suppressed, and that the author withdrew to
   France before or immediately after its appearance. This may account for
   his not sending copies to his friends in this country."

   Mr. Beckley, however, had by this time received a copy and loaned it to
   Jefferson, with a request that he would send it to J. B. Smith, whose
   brother, S. H. Smith, printed it with the following Preface: 

   "The following Extracts from a note accompanying a copy of this pamphlet
   for republication is so respectable a testing of its value, that the
   Printer hopes the distinguished writer will excuse its present appearance.
   It proceeds from a character equally eminent in the councils of America,
   and conversant in the affairs of France, from a long and recent residence
   at the Court of Versailles in the Diplomatic department; and at the same
   time that it does justice to the writings of Mr. Paine, it reflects honor
   on the source from which it flows by directing the mind to a contemplation
   of that Republican firmness and Democratic simplicity which endear their
   possessor to every friend of the Rights of Man.

   "After some prefatory remarks the Secretary of State observes:

   "`I am extremely pleased to find it will be reprinted, and that something
   is at length to be publickly said against the political heresies which
   have sprung up among us.

   " `I have no doubt our citizens will rally a second time round
   the standard of Common Sense.' "

   As the pamphlet had been dedicated to the President127, this encomium of
   the Secretary of State ("Jefferson" was not mentioned by the sagacious
   publisher) gave it the air of a manifesto by the administration. Had all
   been contrived, Paine's arrow could not have been more perfectly feathered
   to reach the heart of the anti-republican faction. The Secretary's
   allusion to "political heresies" was so plainly meant for the
   Vice-President that a million hands tossed the gauntlet to him, and
   supposed it was his own hand that took it up. These letters, to The
   Columbian Centinel (Boston), were indeed published in England as by "John
   Adams," and in the trial of Paine were quoted by the Attorney-General as
   proceeding from "the second in the executive government" of America. Had
   it been generally known, however, that they were by the Vice-President's
   son, John Quincy Adams, the effect might not have been very different on
   the father. Edmund Randolph, in view of John Adams' past services, felt
   some regret at the attacks on him, and wrote to Madison: "I should rejoice
   that the controversy has been excited, were it not that under the
   character of [Publicola] he, who was sufficiently depressed before, is now
   irredeemable in the public opinion without being the real author. "The
   youth, however, was only in his twenty-fourth year, and pretty certainly
   under his father's inspiration.

   It is improbable, however, that John Adams could have written such
   scholarly and self-restrained criticisms on any work by Paine, mere
   mention of whom always made him foam at the mouth. Publicola's arguments
   could not get a fair hearing amid surviving animosities against England
   and enthusiasm for a republican movement in France, as yet not a
   revolution, which promised the prevalence of American ideas in Europe. The
   actual England of that era, whose evils were powerfully portrayed by
   Paine, defeated in advance any theoretical estimate of the advantages of
   its unwritten Constitution. America had, too, an inventor's pride in its
   written Constitution, as yet untried by experience. Publicola assailed,
   successfully as I think, Paine's principle that a vitiated legislature
   could never be trusted to reform itself. It was answered that there is no
   reason why the people may not delegate to a legislature, renewed by
   suffrage, the power of altering even the organic law. Publicola contends
   that the people could not act in their original character in changing a
   constitution, in opposition to an existing legislature, without danger of
   anarchy and war; that if the people were in harmony with their legislature
   it could be trusted to carry out their amendments; that a legislature
   without such constitutional powers would nevertheless exercise them by
   forced constructions; and that the difficulty and delay of gathering the
   people in convention might conceivably endanger the commonwealth, were the
   power of fundamental alteration not delegated to the legislature, -- a
   concurrent right being reserved by the people.

   This philosophical statement, interesting in the light of French
   revolutions and English evolutions, recoiled on Publicola from the walls
   of Paine's real fortress. This was built of the fact that in England the
   majority was not represented even in the Commons, and that the people had
   no representation at all in two branches of their government. Moreover,
   Paine's plea had been simply for such reconstitution of government as
   would enable the people to reform it without revolution or convulsion.
   Publicola was compelled to admit that the English people had no resort but
   the right of revolution, so that it appeared mere Monarchism to argue
   against Paine's plea for a self-amending constitution in England.

   Publicola's retort on the Secretary's phrase, "political heresies"
   (infelicitous from a freethinker), -- "Does he consider this pamphlet of
   Mr. Paine's as the canonical book of political scripture," -- hurt
   Jefferson so much that he supposed himself harmed. He was indeed much
   annoyed by the whole affair, and straightway wrote to political leaders
   letters -- some private, others to be quoted, -- in which he sought to
   smooth things by declaring that his note was not meant for publication. To
   Washington he writes (May 8th) the Beckley-Smith story, beginning: 

   "I am afraid the indiscretion of a printer has committed me with my friend
   Mr. Adams, for whom, as one of the most honest and disinterested men
   alive, I have a cordial esteem, increased by long habits of concurrence in
   opinion in the days of his republicanism; and even since his apostasy to
   hereditary monarchy and nobility, though we differ, we differ as friends
   should do."

   The "Jeffersonians" were, of course, delighted, and there is no knowing
   how much reputation for pluck the Secretary was gaining in the country at
   the very moment when his intimate friends were soothing his tremors. These
   were increased by the agitation of the British representatives in America
   over the affair. The following re-enforcement was sent by Madison on May
   12th: 

   "I had seen Paine's pamphlet, with the Preface of the Philadelphia
   edition. It immediately occurred that you were brought into the
   frontispiece in the manner you explain. But I had not foreseen the
   particular use made of it by the British partizans. Mr. Adams can least of
   all complain. Under a mock defence of the Republican constitutions of his
   country he attacked them with all the force he possessed, and this in a
   book with his name to it, while he was the Representative of his country
   at a foreign Court. Since he has been the second magistrate in the new
   Republic, his pen has constantly been at work in the same Cause; and
   though his name has not been prefixed to his anti-republican discourses,
   the author has been as well known as if that formality had been observed.
   Surely if it be innocent and decent in one servant of the public thus to
   write attacks against its Government, it cannot be very criminal or
   indecent in another to patronize a written defence of the principles on
   which that Government is founded. The sensibility of Hammond [British
   Minister] and Bond [British Consul-General] for the indignity to the
   British Constitution is truly ridiculous. If offence could be justly taken
   in that quarter, what would France have a right to say to Burke's
   pamphlet, and the countenance given to it and its author, particularly by
   the King himself? What, in fact, might not the United States say, when
   revolutions and democratic Governments come in for a large charge of the
   scurrility lavished on those of France?"

   One curious circumstance of this incident was that the fuss made by these
   British agents was about a book concerning which heir government, under
   whose nose it was published, had not said a word. There was, indeed, one
   sting in the American edition which was not in the English, but that does
   not appear to have been noticed128. The resentment shown by the British
   agents was plainly meant to aid Adams and the partisans of England in
   their efforts to crush the republicans, and bring Washington to their side
   in hostility to Jefferson. Four years later they succeeded, and already it
   was apparent to the republican leaders that fine engineering was required
   to keep the Colossus on their side. Washington being at Mount Vernon, his
   secretary, Tobias Lear, was approached by Major Beckwith, an English agent
   (at Mrs. Washington's reception), who undertook to lecture through him the
   President and Secretary of State. He expressed surprise that Paine's
   pamphlet should be dedicated to the President, as it contained remarks
   "that could not but be offensive to the British government." The Major
   might have been embarrassed if asked his instructions on the point, but
   Lear only said that the President had not seen the pamphlet, nor could he
   be held responsible for its sentiments. "True," said Beckwith, "but I
   observe, in the American edition, that the Secretary of State has given a
   most unequivocal sanction to the book, as Secretary of State; it is not
   said as Mr. Jefferson." Lear said he had seen the pamphlet, "but," he
   added, "I will venture to say that the Secretary of State has not done a
   thing which he would not justify." Beckwith then remarked that he had
   spoken only as "a private character," and Lear went off to report the
   conversation in a letter to Washington (May 8th), and next day to
   Attorney-General Randolph. Lear also reports to Washington that he had
   heard Adams say, with his hand upon his breast: "I detest that book and
   its tendency, from the bottom of my heart." Meanwhile the
   Attorney-General, after conversation with Beckwith, visited Jefferson, and
   asked if he had authorized the publication of his note in Paine's
   pamphlet. 

   "Mr. Jefferson said that, so far from having authorized it, he was
   exceedingly sorry to see it there; not from a disavowal of the approbation
   which it gave the work, but because it had been sent to the printer, with
   the pamphlet for republication, without the most distant idea that he
   would think of publishing any part of it. And Mr. Jefferson further added
   that he wished it might be understood, that he did not authorize he
   publication of any part of his note."

   These words of Lear to Washington, written no doubt in Randolph's
   presence, suggest the delicacy of the situation. Jefferson's anxiety led
   him to write Vice-President Adams (July 17th) the Beckley-Smith story. 

   "I thought [he adds] so little of the note that I did not even keep a copy
   of it, nor ever heard a little more of it till, the week following, I was
   thunderstruck with seeing it come out at the head of the pamphlet. I hoped
   that it would not attract. But I found on my return from a journey of a
   month, that a writer came forward under the name of Publicola, attacking
   not only the author and principles of the pamphlet, but myself as its
   sponsor by name. Soon after came hosts of other writers, defending the
   pamphlet and attacking you by name as the writer of Publicola. Thus our
   names were thrown on the stage as public antagonists."

   Then follows some effusiveness for Adams, and protestations that he has
   written none of these attacks. Jefferson fully believed that Publicola was
   the Vice-President, and had so informed Monroe, on July 10th. It was
   important that his lieutenants should not suspect their leader of
   shrinking, and Jefferson's letters to them are in a different vein.
   "Publicola," he tells Monroe, "in attacking all Paine's principles, is
   very desirous of involving me in the same censure with the author. I
   certainly merit the same, for I profess the same principles; but it is
   equally certain I never meant to have entered as a volunteer in the cause.
   My occupations do not permit it." To Paine he writes (July 29th):  
   "Indeed I am glad you did not come away till you had written your Rights
   of Man. A writer under the signature of Publicola has attacked it, and a
   host of champions has entered the arena immediately in your defence." It
   is added that the controversy has shown the people firm in their
   republicanism, "contrary to the assertions of a sect here, high in name
   but small in numbers," who were hoping that the masses were becoming
   converted "to the doctrine of King, Lords, and Commons."

   In the letter to which this was a reply, Paine had stated his intention of
   returning to America in the spring129. The enthusiasm for Paine and his
   principles elicited by the controversy was so overwhelming that Edmund
   Randolph and Jefferson made an effort to secure him a place in
   Washington's Cabinet. But, though reinforced by Madison, they failed130.
   These statesmen little knew how far Washington had committed himself to
   the British government. In October, 1789, Washington, with his own hand,
   had written to Gouverneur Morris, desiring him in "the capacity of private
   agent, and on the authority and credit of this letter, to converse with
   His Britannic Majesty's ministers on these points; viz., whether there be
   any, and what objections to performing those articles in the treaty which
   remained to be performed on his part, and whether they incline to a treaty
   of commerce with the United States on any, and what terms?" This was a
   secret between Washington, Morris, and the British Cabinet131. It was the
   deepest desire of Washington to free America from British garrisons, and
   his expectation was to secure this by the bribe of a liberal commercial
   treaty, as he ultimately did. The demonstration of the British agents in
   America against Paine's pamphlet, their offence at its dedication to the
   President and sanction by the Secretary of State, were well calculated.
   That it was all an American coup, unwarranted by any advice from England,
   could not occur to Washington, who was probably surprised when he
   presently received letter from Paine showing that he was getting along
   quite comfortably under the government he was said to have aggrieved. 

   LONDON, July 21, 1791

   DEAR SIR.

   I received your favor of last August by Col. Humphries since which I have
   not written to or heard from you. I mention this that you may know no
   letters have miscarried. I took the liberty of addressing my late
   work `Rights of Man,' to you; but tho' I left t at that time to find its
   way to you, I now request your acceptance of fifty copies as a token of
   remembrance to yourself and my Friends. the work has had a run beyond
   anything that has been published in this Country on the subject of
   Government, and the demand continues. In Ireland it has had a much
   greater. A letter I received from Dublin, 10th of May, mentioned that the
   fourth edition was then on sale. I know not what number of copies were
   printed at each edition, except the second, which was ten thousand. The
   same fate follows me here as I at first experienced in America, strong
   friends and violent enemies, but as I have got the ear of the Country, I
   shall go on, and at least shew them, what is a novelty here, that there
   can be a person beyond the reach of corruption.

   "I arrived here from France about ten days ago. M. de la Fayette
   [Lafayette] is well. The affairs of that Country are verging to a new
   crisis, whether the Government shall be Monarchical and heredetary or
   wholly representative? I think the latter opinion will very generally
   prevail in the end. On this question the people are much forwarder than
   the National Assembly.

   "After the establishment of the American Revolution, it did not appear to
   me that any object could arise great enough to engage me a second time. I
   began to feel myself happy in being quiet; but I now experience that
   principle is not confined to Time or place, and that the ardour of
   seventy-six is capable of renewing itself. I have another work on hand
   which I intend shall be my last, for I long much to return to America. It
   is not natural that fame should wish for a rival, but the case is
   otherwise with me, for I do most sincerely wish there was some person in
   this Country that could usefully and successfully attract the public
   attention, and leave me with a satisfied mind to the enjoyment of quiet
   life: but it is painful to see errors and abuses and sit down a senseless
   spectator. Of this your own mind will interpret mine.

   "I have printed sixteen thousand copies; when the whole are gone of which
   there remain between three and four thousand I shall then make a cheap
   edition, just sufficient to bring in the price of the printing and paper
   as I did by Common Sense.

   "Mr. Green who will present you this, has been very much my friend. I
   wanted last October to draw for fifty pounds on General Lewis Morris who
   has some money of mine, but as he is unknown in the Commercial line, and
   American credit not very good, and my own expended, I could not succeed,
   especially as Gov'r Morris was then in Holland. Col. Humphries went with
   me to your Agent Mr. Walsh, to whom I stated the case, and took the
   liberty of saying that I knew you would not think it a trouble to receive
   it of Gen. Morris on Mr. Walsh's account, but he declined it. Mr. Green
   afterwards supplied me and I have since repaid him. He has a troublesome
   affair on his hands here, and is in danger of losing thirty or forty
   thousand pounds, embarked under the flag of the United States in East
   India property. The persons who have received it withhold it and shelter
   themselves under some law contrivance. He wishes to state the case to
   Congress not only on his own account, but as a matter that may be
   nationally interesting.

   "The public papers will inform you of the riots and tumults at Birmingham,
   and of some disturbances at Paris, and as Mr. Green can detail them to you
   more particularly than I can do in a letter I leave those matters to his
   information. I am, etc."

   Nine months elapsed before Washington answered this letter, and although
   important events of those months have yet to be related, the answer may be
   here put on record. 

   "PHILADELPHIA, 6 May, 1792.

   "DEAR SIR.

   "To my friends, and those who know my occupations, I am sure no apology is
   necessary for keeping their letters so much longer unanswered, than my
   inclination would lead me to do. I shall therefore offer no excuse for not
   having sooner acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 21st of June
   [July]. My thanks, however, for the token of your remembrance, in the
   fifty copies of `The Rights of Man,' are offered with no less cordiality,
   than they would have been had I answered your letter in the first moment
   of receiving it.

   "The duties of my office, which at all times, especially during the
   session of Congress, require an unremitting attention, naturally become
   more pressing towards the close of it; and as that body have resolved to
   rise tomorrow, and as I have determined, in case they should, to set out
   for Mount Vernon on the next day, you will readily conclude that the
   present is a busy moment with me; and to that I am persuaded your goodness
   will impute my not entering into the several points touched upon in your
   letter. Let it suffice, therefore, at this time, to say, that I rejoice in
   the information of your personal prosperity, and, as no one can feel a
   greater interest in the happiness of mankind than I do, that it is the
   first wish of my heart, that the enlightened policy of the present age may
   diffuse to all men those blessings, to which they are entitled, and lay
   the foundation of happiness for future generations.

   "With great esteem, I am, dear Sir &c. 

   "P. S. Since writing the foregoing, I have received your letter of the
   13th of February, with the twelve copies of your new work, which
   accompanied it, and for which you must accept my additional thanks."

   There is no lack of personal cordiality in this letter, but one may
   recognize in its ingenious vagueness, in its omission of any
   acknowledgment of the dedication of Paine's book, that he mistrusts the
   European revolution and its American allies. 
    

                                  CHAPTER  XXI

                        FOUNDING THE EUROPEAN REPUBLIC 
                                     [1791]

   IT has already been mentioned that John Adams had been proclaimed in
   France the author of "Common Sense."132 The true author was now known,
   but, as the anti-monarchal parts of his work were expurgated, Paine, in
   turn, was supposed to be a kind of John Adams -- a revolutionary royalist.
   This misunderstanding was personally distasteful, but it had the important
   compensation of enabling Paine to come before Europe with a work adapted
   to its conditions, essentially different from those of America to which
   "Common Sense" was addressed in 1776. It was a matter of indifference to
   him whether the individual executive was called "King" or "President." He
   objected to the thing, not the name, but as republican superstition had
   insisted on it in America there was little doubt that France would follow
   the example. Under these circumstances Paine made up his mind that the
   republican principle would not be lost by the harmonizing policy of
   preserving the nominal and ornamental king while abolishing his
   sovereignty. The erection of a tremendous presidential power in the United
   States might well suggest to so staunch a supporter of ministerial
   government that this substance might be secured under a show of royalty.
   Dr. Robinet considers it a remarkable "prophecy" that Paine should have
   written in 1787 of an approaching alliance of "the Majesty of the
   Sovereign with the Majesty of the Nation" in France. This was opposed to
   the theories of Jefferson, but it was the scheme of Mirabeau, the hope of
   Lafayette, and had not the throne been rotten this prudent policy might
   have succeeded. It was with an eye to France as well as to England that
   Paine, in his reply to Burke, had so carefully distinguished between
   executive sovereignty subject to law and personal monarchy.

   When the last proof of his book was revised Paine sped to Paris, and
   placed it in the hand of his friend M. Lanthenas for translation133.
   Mirabeau was on his death-bed, and Paine witnessed that historic
   procession, four miles long, which bore the orator to his shrine.
   Witnessed it with relief, perhaps, for he is ominously silent concerning
   Mirabeau. With others he strained his eyes to see the Coming Man; with
   others he sees formidable Danton glaring at Lafayette; and presently sees
   advancing softly between them the sentimental, philanthropic --
   Robespierre.

   It was a happy hour for Paine when, on a day in May, he saw Robespierre
   rise in the National Assembly to propose abolition of the death penalty.
   How sweet this echo of the old "testimonies" of Thetford Quaker meetings.
   "Capital, punishment," cries Robespierre, "is but a base assassination,
   punishing" one crime by another, murder with murder. Since judges are not
   infalible they have no right to pronounce irreparable sentences." He is
   seconded by the jurist Duport, who says impressively: "Let us at least
   make revolutionary scenes as little tragic as possible!   Let us render
   man honorable to man!" Marat, right man for the role, answered with the
   barbaric demand "blood for blood," and prevailed. But Paine was won over
   to Robespierre by this humane enthusiasm. The day was to come when he must
   confront Robespierre with a memory of this scene.

   That Robespierre would supersede Lafayette Paine could little imagine. The
   King was in the charge of the great friend of America, and never had
   country a fairer prospect than France in those beautiful spring days. But
   the royal family fled. In the early morning of June 21st Lafayette burst
   into Paine's bedroom, before he was up, and cried   "The birds are flown!"
   "It is well," said Paine; "I hope there will be no attempt to recall
   them." Hastily dressing, he rushed out into the street, and found the
   people in uproar. They were clamoring as if some great loss had befallen
   them. At the Hotel de Ville Lafayette was menaced by the crowd,, which
   accused him of having assisted the King's flight, and could only answer
   them: "What are you complaining of? Each of you saves twenty sous tax by
   suppression of the Civil List." Paine encounters his friend Thomas
   Christie. "You see," he said, "the absurdity of monarchical governments;
   here will be a whole nation disturbed by the folly of one man."134

   Here was Marat's opportunity. His journal, L'Ami du Peuple, clamored for a
   dictator, and for the head of Lafayette. Against him rose young
   Bonneville, who, in La Bouche de Fer, wrote: "No more kings!   No
   dictator! Assemble the People in the face of the sun; proclaim that the
   Law alone shall be sovereign, -- the Law, the Law alone, and made for
   all!"

   Bonnevilles words in his journal about that time were apt to be
   translations from the works of his friend Paine, with whom his life was
   afterwards so closely interwoven. The little group of men who had studied
   Paine, ardent republicans, beheld a nation suddenly become frantic to
   recover a king who could not be of the slightest value to any party in the
   state. The miserable man had left a letter denouncing all the liberal
   measures he had signed since October, 1789, which sealed his doom as a
   monarch. The appalling fact was revealed that the most powerful
   revolutionists -- Robespierre and Marat especially -- had never considered
   a Republic, and did not know what it was.

   On June 25th, Paine was a heavy-hearted spectator of the return of the
   arrested king. He had personal realization that day of the folly of a
   people in bringing back a king who had relieved them of his presence. He
   had omitted to decorate his hat with a cockade, and the mob fell on him
   with cries of "Aristocrat! `a la lanterne!" After some rough handling he
   was rescued by a Frenchman who spoke English, and explained the accidental
   character of the offence. Poor Paine's Quaker training had not included
   the importance of badges, else the incident had revealed to him that even
   the popular rage against Louis was superstitious homage to a cockade.
   Never did friend of the people have severer proofs that they are generally
   wrong. In America, while writing as with his heart's blood the first plea
   for its independence, he was "shadowed" as a British spy; and in France he
   narrowly escapes the aristocrat's lantern, at the very moment when he was
   founding the first republican society, and writing its declaration.

   This "Societe Republicaine," as yet of five members, inaugurated itself on
   July 1st, by placarding Paris with its manifesto135, which was even nailed
   on the door of the National Assembly. 

   "Brethren and fellow citizens:

   "The serene tranquillity, the mutual confidence which prevailed amongst
   us, during the time of the late King's escape, the indifference with which
   we beheld him return, are unequivocal proofs that the absence of a King is
   more desirable than his presence, and that he is not only a political
   superfluity, but a grievous burden, pressing hard on the whole nation.

   "The celebrated Paine was at this time in Paris, and intimate in
   Condorcet's family. Thinking that he had effected the American Revolution,
   he fancied himself called upon to bring about one in France. Duchatelet
   called on me, and after a little preface placed in my hand an English
   manuscript -- a Proclamation to the French People. It was nothing less
   than an anti-royalist Manifesto, and summoned the nation to seize the
   opportunity and establish a Republic. Paine was its author. Duchatelet had
   adopted and was resolved to sign, placard the walls of Paris with it, and
   take the consequences. He had come to request me to translate and develop
   it. I began discussing the strange proposal, and pointed out the danger of
   raising a republican standard without concurrence of the National
   Assembly, and nothing being as yet known of the king's intentions,
   resources, alliances, and possibilities of support by the army, and in the
   provinces. I asked if he had consulted any of the most influential
   leaders, Sieyes, Lafayette, etc. He had not: he and Paine had acted alone.
   An American and an impulsive    nobleman had put themselves forward to
   change the whole governmental system of France. Resisting his entreaties,
   I refused to translate the Proclamation. Next day The Republican
   Proclamation appeared on the walls in every part of Paris, and was
   denounced to the Assembly. The idea of a Republic had previously presented
   itself to no one: this first intimation filled with consternation the
   Right and the moderates of the Left. Malouet, Cazales, and others proposed
   prosecution of the author, but Chapelier, and a numerous party, fearing to
   add fuel to the fire instead of extinguishing it, prevented this. But some
   of the seed sown by the audacious hand of Paine were now budding in
   leading minds."

   -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii, Introduction, p.vi-vii.

   "Let us not be imposed upon by sophisms; all that concerns this is reduced
   to four points.

   "He has abdicated the throne in having fled from his post. Abdication and
   desertion are not characterized by the length of absence; but by the
   single act of flight. In the present instance, the act is everything, and
   the time nothing.

   "The nation can never give back its confidence to a man who false to his
   trust, perjured to his oath, conspires a clandestine flight, obtains a
   fraudulent passport, conceals a King of France under the disguise of a
   valet, directs his course towards a frontier covered with traitors and
   deserters, and evidently meditates a return into our country, with a force
   capable of imposing his own despotic laws.

   "Whether ought his flight to be considered as his own act, or the act of
   those who fled with him? Was it a spontaneous resolution of his own, or
   was it inspired into him by others? The alternative is immaterial; whether
   fool or hypocrite, idiot or traitor, he has proved himself equally
   unworthy of the important functions that had been delegated to him.

   "In every sense that the question can be considered, the reciprocal
   obligation which subsisted between us is dissolved. He holds no longer any
   authority. We owe him no longer obedience. We see in him no more than an
   indifferent person; we can regard him only as Louis Capet.

   "The history of France presents little else than a long series of public
   calamity, which takes its source from the vices of the Kings; we have been
   the wretched victims that have never ceased to suffer either for them or
   by them. The catalogue of their oppressions was complete, but to complete
   the sum of their crimes, treason yet was wanting. Now the only vacancy is
   filled up, the dreadful list is full; the system is exhausted; there are
   no remaining errors for them to commit, their reign is consequently at an
   end.

   "What kind of office must that be in a government which requires neither
   experience nor ability to execute? that may be abandoned to the desperate
   chance of birth, that may be filled with an idiot, a madman, a tyrant,
   with equal effect as by the good, the virtuous, and the wise? An office of
   this nature is a mere nonentity: it is a place of show, not of use. Let
   France then, arrived at the age of reason, no longer be I deluded by the
   sound of words, and let her deliberately examine, if a King, however
   insignificant and contemptible in himself, may not at the same time be
   extremely dangerous.

   "The thirty millions which it costs to support a King in the eclat of
   stupid brutal luxury, presents us with an easy method of reducing taxes,
   which reduction would at once release the people, and stop the progress of
   political corruption. The grandeur of nations consists, not, as Kings
   pretend, in the splendor of thrones, but in a conspicuous sense of their
   own dignity, and in a just disdain of those barbarous follies and crimes,
   which, under the sanction of royalty have hitherto desolated Europe.

   "As to the personal safety of Louis Capet, it is so much the more
   confirmed, as France will not stoop to degrade herself by a spirit of
   revenge against a wretch who has dishonored himself. In defending a just
   and glorious cause, it is not possible to degrade it, and the universal
   tranquillity which prevails is an undeniable proof, that a free people
   know how to respect themselves."136

   Malouet, a leading royalist member, tore down the handbill, and, having
   ascertained its author, demanded the prosecution of Thomas Paine and
   Achille Duchatelet. He was vehemently supported by Martineau, deputy of
   Paris, and for a time there was a tremendous agitation. The majority, not
   prepared to commit themselves to anything at all, voted the order of the
   day, affecting, says Henri Martin, a disdain that hid embarrassment and
   inquietude.

   This document, destined to reappear in a farther crisis, and the royalist
   rage, raised Paine's Republican Club to vast importance. Even the
   Jacobins, who had formally declined to sanction republicanism, were
   troubled by the discovery of a society more radical than themselves. It
   was only some years later that it was made known (by Paine) that this
   formidable association consisted of five members, and it is still doubtful
   who these were. Certainly Paine, Achille Duchatelet, and Condorcet;
   probably also Brissot, and Nicolas Bonneville137. In order to avail itself
   of this tide of fame, the Societe Republicaine started a journal, -- The
   Republican138. The time was not ripe, however; only one copy appeared;
   that, however, contained a letter by Paine, written in June, which excited
   considerable flutter. To the reader of to-day it is mainly interesting as
   showing Paine's perception that the French required instruction in the
   alphabet of republicanism; but, amid its studied moderation, there was a
   paragraph which the situation rendered pregnant: 

   "Whenever the French Constitution shall be rendered conformable to its
   declaration of rights, we shall then be enabled to give to France, and
   with justice, the appellation of a Civic Empire; for its government will
   be the empire of laws, founded on the great republican principles of
   elective representation and the rights of man. But monarchy and hereditary
   succession are incompatible with the basis of its Constitution."139

   Now this was the very constitution which Paine, in his answer to Burke,
   had made comparatively presentable; to this day it survives in human
   memory mainly through indulgent citations in "The Rights of Man." Those
   angels who, in the celestial war, tried to keep friendly with both sides,
   had human counterparts in France, their constitutional oracle being the
   Abbe Sieyes. He had entered warmly into the Revolution, invented the name
   "National Assembly," opposed the veto power, supported the Declaration of
   Rights. But he had a superstitious faith in individual executive, which,
   as an opportunist, he proposed to vest in the reigning house. This class
   of "survivals" in the constitution were the work of Sieyes, who was the
   brain of the Jacobins, now led by Robespierre, and with him ignoring
   republicanism for no better reason than that their title was "Societe des
   Amis de la Constitution."140 Sieyes petted his constitution maternally,
   perhaps because nobody else loved it, and bristled at Paine's criticism.
   He wrote a letter to theMoniteur, asserting that there was more liberty
   under a monarchy than under a republic. He announced his intention of
   maintaining monarchical executive against the new party started into life
   by the King's flight. In the same journal (July 8th,) Paine accepts the
   challenge "with pleasure." Paine himself was something of an opportunist;
   as in America he had favored reconciliation with George III. up to the
   Lexington massacre, so had he desired a modus vivendi with Louis XVI. up
   to his flight141. But now he unfurls the anti-monarchical flag. 

   "I am not the personal enemy of Kings. Quite the contrary. No man wishes
   more heartily than myself to see them all in the happy and honorable state
   of private individuals; but I am the avowed, open, and intrepid enemy of
   what is called monarchy; and I am such by principles which nothing can
   either alter or corrupt -- by my attachment to humanity; by the anxiety
   which I feel within myself for the dignity and honor of the human race; by
   the disgust which I experience when I observe men directed by children and
   governed by brutes; by the horror which all the evils that monarchy has
   spread over the earth excite within my breast; and by those sentiments
   which make me shudder at the calamities, the exactions, the wars, and the
   massacres with which monarchy has crushed mankind. in short, it is against
   all the hell of monarchy that I have declared war."

   In reply Sieyes used the terms "monarchy" and "republic" in unusual
   senses. He defines "republic" as a government in which the executive power
   is lodged in more than one person, "monarchy" as one where it is entrusted
   to one only. He asserted that while he was in this sense a monarchist
   Paine was a "polycrat." In a republic all action must finally lodge in an
   executive council deciding by majority, and nominated by the people or the
   National Assembly. Sieyes did not, however, care to enter the lists. "My
   letter does not announce that I have leisure to enter into a controversy
   with republican polycrats."

   Paine now set out for London. He travelled with Lord Daer and Etienne
   Dumont, Mirabeau's secretary. Dumont had a pique against Paine, whose
   republican manifesto had upset a literary scheme of his, -- to evoke
   Mirabeau from the tomb and make him explain to the National Assembly that
   the King's flight was a court plot, that they should free Louis XVI. from
   aristocratic captivity, and support him. But on reading the Paine placard,
   "I determined, "says Dumont, "for fear of evil consequences to myself, to
   make Mirabeau return to his tomb."142 Dumont protests that Paine was fully
   convinced that the world would be benefited if all other books were burned
   except "The Rights of Man," and no doubt the republican apostle had a
   sublime faith in the sacred character of his "testimonies" against kings.
   Without attempting to determine whether this was the self-reliance of
   humility or egoism, it may be safely affirmed that it was that which made
   Paine's strokes so effective.

   It may also be remarked again that Paine showed a prudence with which he
   has not been credited. Thus, there is little doubt that this return to
   London was in pursuance of an invitation to attend a celebration of the
   second anniversary of the fall of the Bastille. He arrived at the White
   Bear, Piccadilly, the day before (July 13th), but on finding that there
   was much excitement about his republican manifesto in France he concluded
   that his presence at the meeting might connect it with movements across
   the Channel, and did not attend. Equal prudence was not, however,
   displayed by his opponents, who induced the landlord of the Crown and
   Anchor to close his doors against the advertised meeting. This effort to
   prevent the free assemblage of Englishmen, and for the humane purpose of
   celebrating the destruction of a prison whose horrors had excited popular
   indignation, caused general anger. After due consideration it was deemed
   opportune for those who sympathized with the movement in France to issue a
   manifesto on the subject. It was written by Paine, and adopted by a
   meeting held at the Thatched House Tavern, August 20th, being signed by
   John Horne Tooke, as Chairman. This "Address and Declaration of the
   Friends of Universal Peace and Liberty," though preceded by the
   vigorous "Declaration of the Volunteers of Belfast," quoted in its second
   paragraph, was the earliest warning England received that the revolution
   was now its grim guest. 

   "Friends and Fellow Citizens:

   At a moment like the present, when wilful misrepresentations are
   industriously spread by partizans of arbitrary power and the advocates of
   passive obedience and court government, we think it incumbent upon us to
   declare to the world our principles, and the motives of our conduct.

   "We rejoice at the glorious event of the French revolution. If it be
   asked, `What is the French revolution to us?' We answer as has already
   been answered in another place, `It is much -- much to us as men; much to
   us as Englishmen. As men, we rejoice in the freedom of twenty-five
   millions of men.

   We rejoice in the prospect which such a magnificent example opens to the
   world.'

   "We congratulate the French nation for having laid the axe to the root of
   tyranny, and for erecting government on the sacred hereditary rights of
   man; rights which appertain to all, and not to any one more than another.

   "We know of no human authority superior to that of a whole nation; and we
   profess and claim it as our principle that every nation has at all times
   an inherent and indefeasable right to constitute and establish such
   government for itself as best accords with its disposition, interest, and
   happiness.

   "As Englishmen we also rejoice, because we are immediately interested in
   the French Revolution.

   "Without inquiring into the justice, on either side, of the reproachful
   charges of intrigue and ambition which the English and French courts have
   constantly made on each other, we confine ourselves to this observation,
   -- that if the court of France only was in fault, and the numerous wars
   which have distressed both countries are chargeable to her alone, that
   court now exists no longer, and the cause and the consequence must cease
   together. The French therefore, by the revolution they have made, have
   conquered for us as well as for themselves, if it be true that this court
   only was in fault, and ours never.

   "On this side of the case the French revolution concerns us immediately;
   we are oppressed with a heavy national debt, a burthen of taxes, an
   expensive administration of government, beyond those of any people in the
   world.

   "We have also a very numerous poor; and we hold that the moral obligation
   of providing for old age, helpless infancy, and poverty, is far superior
   to that of supplying the invented wants of courtly extravagance, ambition,
   and intrigue.

   "We believe there is no instance to be produced but in England, of seven
   millions of inhabitants, which make but little more than one million
   families, paying yearly seventeen millions of taxes.

   "As it has always been held out by the administrations that the restless
   ambition of the court of France rendered this expences necessary to us for
   our own defence, we consequently rejoice, as men deeply interested in the
   French revolution; for that court, as we have already said, exists no
   longer, and consequently the same enormous expences need not continue to
   us.

   "Thus rejoicing as we sincerely do, both as men and Englishmen, as lovers
   of universal peace and freedom, and as friends to our national prosperity
   and reduction of our public expences, we cannot but express our
   astonishment that any part or any members of our own government should
   reprobate the extinction of that very power in France, or wish to see it
   restored, to whose influence they formerly attributed (whilst they
   appeared to lament) the enormous increase of our own burthens and taxes.
   What, then, are they sorry that the pretence for new oppressive taxes, and
   the occasion for continuing many old taxes, will be at an end? If so, and
   if it is the policy of courts and court government to prefer enemies to
   friends, and a system of war to that of peace, as affording more pretences
   for places, offices, pensions, revenue and taxation, it is high time for
   the people of every nation to look with circumspection to their own
   interest.

   "Those who pay the expences, and not those who participate in the
   emoluments arising from them, are the persons immediately interested in
   inquiries of this kind. We are a part of that national body on whom this
   annual expence of seventeen millions falls; and we consider the present
   opportunity of the French revolution as a most happy one for lessening the
   enormous load under which this nation groans. If this be not done we shall
   then have reason to conclude that the cry of intrigue and ambition against
   other courts is no more than the common cant of all courts.

   "We think it also necessary to express our astonishment that a government
   desirous of being called FREE , should prefer connexion with the most
   despotic and arbitrary powers in Europe. We know of none more deserving
   this description than those of Turkey and Prussia, and the whole
   combination of German despots.

   "Separated as we happily are by nature from the tumults of the continent,
   we reprobate all systems and intrigues which sacrifice (and that too at a
   great expence) the blessings of our natural situation. Such systems cannot
   have a natural origin.

   "If we are asked what government is, we hold it to be nothing more than a
   national association; and we hold that to be the best which secures to
   every man his rights and promotes the greatest quantity of happiness with
   the least expence. We live to improve, or we live in vain; and therefore
   we admit of no maxims of government or policy on the mere score of
   antiquity or other men's authority, the old whigs or the new.

   "We will exercise the reason with which we are endued, or we possess it
   unworthily. As reason is given at all times, it is for the purpose of
   being used at all times.

   "Among the blessings which the French revolution has produced to that
   nation we enumerate the abolition of the feudal system, of injustice, and
   of tyranny, on the 4th of August, 1789. Beneath the feudal system all
   Europe has long groaned, and from it England is not yet free. Game laws,
   borough tenures, and tyrannical monopolies of numerous kinds still remain
   amongst us; but rejoicing as we sincerely do in the freedom of others till
   we shall haply accomplish our own, we intended to commemorate this prelude
   to the universal extirpation of the feudal system by meeting on the
   anniversary of that day (the 4th of August) at the Crown and Anchor: from
   this meeting we were prevented by the interference of certain unnamed and
   sculking persons with the master of the tavern, who informed us that on
   their representation he would not receive us. Let those who live by or
   countenance feudal oppressions take the reproach of this ineffectual
   meanness and cowardice to themselves: they cannot stifle the public
   declaration of our honest, open, and avowed opinions. These are our
   principles, and these our sentiments; they embrace the interest and
   happiness of the great body of the nation of which we are a part. As to
   riots and tumults, let those answer for them who by wilful
   misrepresentations endeavour to excite and promote them; or who seek to
   stun the sense of the nation, and lose the great cause of public good in
   the outrages of a mis-informed mob. We take our ground on principles that
   require no such riotous aid.

   "We have nothing to apprehend from the poor for we are pleading their
   cause; and we fear not proud oppression for we have truth on our side.

   "We say and we repeat it that the French revolution opens to the world an
   opportunity in which all good citizens must rejoice, that of promoting the
   general happiness of man, and that it moreover offers to this country in
   particular an opportunity of reducing our enormous taxes: these are our
   objects, and we will pursue them."

   A comparative study of Paine's two republican manifestos -- that placarded
   in Paris July 1st, and this of August 20th to the English -- reveals the
   difference between the two nations at that period. No break with the
   throne in England is suggested, as none had been declared in France until
   the King had fled, leaving behind him a virtual proclamation of war
   against all the reforms he had been signing since 1789. The Thatched House
   address leaves it open for the King to take the side of the Republic, and
   be its chief. The address is simply an applied "Declaration of Rights."
   Paine had already maintained, in his reply to Burke, that the English
   monarch was an importation unrelated to the real nation, "which is left to
   govern itself, and does govern itself, by magistrates and juries, almost
   on its own charge, on republican principles." His chief complaint is that
   royalty is an expensive sinecure." So far had George III. withdrawn from
   his attempt to govern as well as reign, which had ended so disastrously in
   America. The fall of the French King who had aided the American
   "rebellion" was probably viewed with satisfaction by the English court, so
   long as the revolution confined itself to France. But now it had raised
   its head in England, and the alarm of aristocracy was as if it were
   threatened with an invasion of political cholera.

   The disease was brought over by Paine. He must be isolated. But he had a
   hold on the people, including a large number of literary men, and
   Non-conformist preachers. The authorities, therefore, began working
   cautiously, privately inducing the landlords of the Crown and Anchor and
   the Thatched House to refuse their rooms to the "Painites," as they were
   beginning to be called. But this was a confession of Paine's power. Indeed
   all opposition at that time was favorable to Paine. Publicola's reply
   to "The Rights of Man," attributed to Vice-President Adams, could only
   heighten Paine's fame; for John Adams' blazing court-dress, which amused
   us at the Centenary (1889), was not forgotten in England; and while his
   influence was limited to court circles, the entrance of so high an
   official into the arena was accepted as homage to the author. The
   publication at the same time of the endorsement of Paine's "Rights of
   Man" by the Secretary of State, the great Jefferson, completed the
   triumph. The English government now had Paine on its hands, and must deal
   with him in one way or another.

   The closing of one door after another of the usual places of assembly to
   sympathizers with the republican movement in France, being by hidden
   hands, could not be charged upon Pitt's government; it was, however, a
   plain indication that a free expression through public meetings could not
   be secured without risk of riots. And probably there would have been
   violent scenes in London had it not been for the moderation of the Quaker
   leader. At this juncture Paine held a supremacy in the constitutional
   clubs of England and Ireland equal to that of Robespierre over the
   Jacobins of Paris. He had the giant's strength, but did not use it like a
   giant. He sat himself down in a quiet corner of London, began another
   book, and from time to time consulted his Cabinet of Reformers.

   His abode was with Thomas Rickman, a bookseller, his devoted friend. He
   had known Rickman at Lewes, as a youthful musical genius of the club
   there, hence called "Clio." He had then set some song of Paine's to music,
   and afterwards his American patriotic songs, as well as many of his own.
   He now lived in London with wife and children these bearing names of the
   great republicans, beginning with Thomas Paine, -- and with them the
   author resided for a time. A particular value, therefore, attaches to the
   following passages in Rickman's book: 

   "Mr. Paine's life in London was a quiet round of philosophical leisure and
   enjoyment. It was occupied in writing, in a small epistolary
   correspondence, in walking about with me to visit different friends,
   occasionally lounging at coffee-houses and public places, or being visited
   by a select few. Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the French and American
   ambassadors, Mr. Sharp the engraver, Romney the painter, Mrs.
   Wolstonecraft, Joel Barlow, Mr. Hull, Mr. Christie, Dr. Priestley, Dr.
   Towers, Col. Oswald, the walking Stewart, Captain Sampson Perry, Mr.
   Tuffin, Mr. William Choppin, Captain De Stark, Mr. Horne Tooke, &c. &c.
   were among the number of his friends and acquaintance; and of course, as
   he was my inmate, the most of my associates were frequently his. At this
   time he read but little, took his nap after dinner, and played with my
   family at some game in the evening, as chess, dominos, and drafts, but
   never at cards; in recitations, singing, music, &c; or passed it in
   conversation: the part he took in the latter was always enlightened, full
   of information, entertainment, and anecdote. Occasionally we visited
   enlightened friends, indulged in domestic jaunts and recreations from
   home, frequently lounging at the White Bear, Picadilly, with his old
   friend the walking Stewart, and other clever travellers from France, and
   different parts of Europe and America. When by ourselves we sat very late,
   and often broke in on the morning hours, indulging the reciprocal
   interchange of affectionate and confidential intercourse. `Warm from the
   heart and faithful to its fires' was that intercourse, and gave to us the
   `feast of reason and the flow of soul.' "

   "Mr. Paine in his person was about five feet ten inches high, and rather
   athletic; he was broad shouldered, and latterly stooped a little. His eye,
   of which the painter could not convey the exquisite meaning, was full,
   brilliant, and singularly piercing; it had in it the `muse of fire.'   In
   his dress and person he was generally very cleanly, and wore his hair
   cued, with side curls, and powdered, so that he looked altogether like a
   gentleman of the old French school. His manners were easy and gracious;
   his knowledge was universal and boundless; in private company and among
   his friends his conversation had every fascination that anecdote, novelty
   and truth could give it. In mixt company and among strangers he said
   little, and was no public speaker."

   Paine does not appear to have ever learned that his name had been pressed
   for a place in Washington's Cabinet, and apparently he did not know until
   long after it was over what a tempest in Jefferson's teapot his book had
   innocently caused. The facts came to him while he was engaged on his next
   work, in which they are occasionally reflected. In introducing an English
   friend to William Short, U. S. Charge d'Affaires at Paris, under date of
   November 2d, Paine reports progress: 

   "I received your favour conveying a letter from Mr. Jefferson and the
   answers to Publicola for which I thank you. I had John Adams in my mind
   when I wrote the pamphlet and it has hit as I expected.

   "M. Lenobia who presents you this is come to pass a few days at Paris. He
   is a bon republicain and you will oblige me much by introducing him among
   our friends of bon foi. I am again in the press but shall not be out till
   about Christmas, when the Town will begin to fill. By what I can find, the
   Government Gentry begin to threaten. They have already tried all the
   under-plots of abuse and scurrility without effect; and have managed those
   in general so badly as to make the work and the author the more famous;
   several answers also have been written against it which did not excite
   reading enough to pay the expence of printing.

   "I have but one way to be secure in my next work which is, to go further
   than in my first. I see that great rogues escape by the excess of their
   crimes, and, perhaps, it may be the same in honest cases. However, I shall
   make a pretty large division in the public opinion, probably too much so
   to encourage the Government to put it to issue, for it will be rather like
   begging them than me.

   "By all the accounts we have here, the french emigrants are in a hopeless
   condition abroad; for my own part I never saw anything to fear from
   foreign courts -- they are more afraid of the French Revolution than the
   revolution needs to be of them; and the same caution which they take to
   prevent the French principles getting among their armies, will prevent
   their sending armies among the principles.

   "We have distressing accounts here from St. Domingo. It is the natural
   consequence of Slavery and must be expected every where. The Negroes are
   enraged at the opposition made to their relief and are determined, if not
   to relieve themselves to punish their enemies. We have no new accounts
   from the East Indies, and people are in much doubt.

   I am, affectionately yours, 

   THOMAS  PAINE."

   The "scurrility" referred to may have been that of George Chalmers,
   elsewhere mentioned. Two days after this letter to Short was written Paine
   received a notable ovation.

   There was a so-called "Revolution Society" in "London, originally formed
   by a number of prominent dissenters. The Society had manifested its
   existence only by listening to a sermon on the anniversary of the
   Revolution of 1688 (November 4th) and thereafter dining together. It had
   not been supposed to interest itself in any later revolution until 1789.
   In that year the annual sermon was delivered by Dr. Richard Price, the
   Unitarian whose defence of the American Revolution received the thanks of
   Congress. In 1776 Price and Burke stood shoulder to shoulder, but the
   sermon of 1789 sundered them. It was "On the Love of our Country," and
   affirmed the constitutional right of the English people to frame their own
   government, to choose their own governors, and to cashier them for
   misconduct. This was the "red rag" that drew Burke into the arena. Dr.
   Price died April 19, 1791, and his great discourse gathered new force from
   the tributes of Priestley and others at his grave. He had been a staunch
   friend of Paine, and at the November festival of this year his place was
   accorded to the man on whom the "Constitutionalists" beheld the mantle of
   Price and the wreath of Washington. The company at this dinner of 1791, at
   the London Tavern, included many eminent men, some of them members of
   Parliament. The old Society was transformed -- William and Mary and 1688
   passed into oblivion before Thomas Paine and 1791. It was probably for
   this occasion that the song was written (by whom I know not) -- "Paine's
   Welcome to Great Britain."

   "He comes -- the great Reformer comes! 
    Cease, cease your trumpets, cease, cease your drums! 
    Those warlike sounds offend the ear, 
    Peace and Friendship now appear 
    Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, 
    Welcome, thou Reformer, here!

   "Prepare, prepare, your songs prepare, 
    Freedom cheers the brow of care; 
    The joyful tidings spread around, 
    Monarchs tremble at the sound! 
    Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom, 
    Rights of Man, and Paine resound!"

   Mr. Dignum sang (to the tune of "The Tear That Bedews Sensibility's
   Shrine.") 

   "Unfold, Father Time, thy long records unfold, 
    Of noble achievements accomplished of old; 
    When men, by the standard of Liberty led, 
    Undauntedly conquered or chearfully bled

   "But now 'midst the triumphs these moments reveal, 
    Their glories all fade and their lustre turns pale, 
    While France rises up, and proclaims the decree 
    That tears off their chains, and bids millions be free.

   "As spring to the fields, or as dew to the flowers. 
    To the earth parched with heat, as the soft dropping showers, 
    As health to the wretch that lies languid and wan, 
    Or rest to the weary -- is Freedom to man!

   "Where Freedom the light of her countenance gives, 
    There only he triumphs, there only he lives; 
    Then seize the glad moment and hail the decree 
    That tears off their chains, and bids millions be free.

   "Too long had oppression and terror entwined 
    Those tyrant-formed chains that enslaved the free mind; 
    While dark superstition, with nature at strife, 
    For ages had locked up the fountain of life;

   "But the daemon is fled, the delusion is past,

    And reason and virtue have triumphed at last; 
    Then seize the glad moments, and hail the decree, 
    That tears off their chains, and bids millions be free.

   "France, we share in the rapture thy bosom that fills, 
    While the Genius of Liberty bounds o'er thy hills 
    Redundant henceforth may thy purple juice flow, 
    Prouder wave thy green woods, and thine olive trees grow!

   "While the hand of philosophy long shall entwine, 
    Blest emblems, the laurel, the myrtle and vine, 
    And heaven through all ages confirm the decree 
    That tears off their chains, and bids millions be free!

   Paine gave as his toast, "The Revolution of the World," and no doubt at
   this point was sung "A New Song," [Hail Great Republic] as it was then
   called, written by Paine himself to the tune of "Rule Britannia": 

   "Hail, Great Republic of the world, 
      The rising empire of the West, 
    Where famed Columbus, with a mighty mind inspired, 
      Gave tortured Europe scenes of rest. 
         Be thou forever, forever great and free, 
         The Land of Love and Liberty.

   "Beneath thy spreading mantling vine, 
      Beside thy flowery groves and springs, 
    And on thy lofty, thy lofty mountains' brow, 
      May all thy sons and fair ones sing. 
                                    Chorus.

   "From thee may rudest nations learn 
      To prize the cause thy sons began; 
    From thee may future, may future tyrants know 
      That sacred are the Rights of Man. 
                                      Chorus.

   "From thee may hated discord fly, 
      With all her dark, her gloomy train; 
    And o'er thy fertile, thy fertile wide domain 
      May everlasting friendship reign. 
                                      Chorus.

   "Of thee may lisping infancy 
      The pleasing wondrous story tell, 
    And patriot sages in venerable mood 
      Instruct the world to govern well. 
                                      Chorus.

   "Ye guardian angels watch around, 
      From harm protect the new-born State; 
    And all ye friendly, ye friendly nations join, 
      And thus salute the Child of Fate. 
         Be thou forever, forever great and free, 
         The Land of Love and Liberty!"

   Notwithstanding royal tremors these gentlemen were genuinely loyal in
   singing the old anthem with new words: 
    

   "God save the Rights of Man! 
    Give him a heart to scan 
         Blessings so dear; 
    Let them be spread around, 
    Wherever Man is found, 
    And with the welcome sound 
         Ravish his ear!"

   No report is preserved of Paine's speech, but we may feel sure that in
   giving his sentiment "The Revolution of the World" he set forth his
   favorite theme -- that revolutions of nations should be as quiet, lawful,
   and fruitful as the revolutions of the earth.

                                        

                                        

                                 CHAPTER  XXII

                            THE RIGHT OF EVOLUTION 
                                     [1792]

   THE Abbe Sieyes did not escape by declining to stand by his challenge of
   the republicans. In the second part of "The Rights of Man" Paine considers
   the position of that gentleman, namely, that hereditary monarchy is an
   evil, but the elective mode historically proven worse. That both are bad
   Paine agrees, but "such a mode of reasoning on such a subject is
   inadmissible, because it finally amounts to an accusation of providence,
   as if she had left to man no other choice with respect to government than
   between two evils." Every now and then this Quaker Antaeus touches his
   mother earth -- the theocratic principle -- in this way; the invigoration
   is recognizable in a religious seriousness, which, however, makes no
   allowance for the merely ornamental parts of government, always so
   popular. "The splendor of a throne is the corruption of a state." However,
   the time was too serious for the utility of bagatelles to be much
   considered by any. Paine engages Sieyes on his own ground, and brings
   historic evidence to prove that the wars of succession, civil and foreign,
   show hereditary a worse evil than elective headship, as illustrated by
   Poland, Holland, and America. But he does not defend the method of either
   of these countries, and clearly shows that he is, as Sieyes said, a
   "polycrat," so far as the numerical composition of the Executive is
   concerned143. He affirms, however, that governing is no function of a
   republican Executive. The law alone governs. "The sovereign authority in
   any country is the power of making laws, and everything else is an
   official department."

   More than fifty thousand copies of the first part of "The Rights of
   Man" had been sold, and the public hungrily awaited the author's next
   work. But he kept back his proofs until Burke should fulfil his promise of
   returning to the subject and comparing the English and French
   constitutions. He was disappointed, however, at finding no such comparison
   in Burke's "Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs." It did, however,
   contain a menace that was worth waiting for.

   "Oldys" (Chalmers) says that Paine was disappointed at not being arrested
   for his first pamphlet on "The Rights of Man," and had, "while fluttering
   on the wing for Paris, hovered about London a whole week waiting to be
   taken." It is, indeed, possible that he would have been glad to elicit
   just then a fresh decision from the courts in favor of freedom of speech
   and of the press, which would strengthen faint hearts. If he had this
   desire he was resolved not to be disappointed a second time.

   A publisher (Chapman) offered him a thousand guineas for the manuscript of
   Part II. Paine declined; "he wished to reserve it in his own hands." Facts
   afterwards appeared which rendered it probable that this was a ministerial
   effort to suppress the book144.

   Paine's Part Second was to appear about the first of February, or before
   the meeting of Parliament. But the printer (Chapman) threw up the
   publication, alleging its "dangerous tendencies," whereby it was delayed
   until February 17th, when it was published by Jordan. Meanwhile, his
   elaborate scheme for reducing taxes so resembled that which Pitt had just
   proposed in Parliament that the author appended his reasons for believing
   that his pages had been read by the government clerk, Chalmers, and his
   plan revealed to Pitt. "Be the case, however, as it may, Mr. Pitt's plan,
   little and diminutive as it is, would have made a very awkward appear once
   had this work appeared at the time the printer had engaged to finish it."

   In the light of Pitt's subsequent career it is a significant fact that, in
   the beginning of 1792, he should be suspected of stealing Paine's
   thunder!   And, indeed, throughout Paine's Part Second the tone towards
   Pitt implies some expectation of reform from him. Its severity is that
   which English agitators for constitutional reform have for a half century
   made familiar and honorable. The historical student finds mirrored in this
   work the rosy picture of the United States as seen at its dawn by the
   disfranchised people of Europe, and beside that a burdened England now
   hardly credible. It includes an historical statement of the powers claimed
   by the crown and gradually distributed among non-elective peers and
   class-elective commoners, the result being a combination of all three
   against admission of the people to any degree of self-government. Though
   the arraignment is heavy, the method of reform is set forth with
   moderation. Particular burdens are pointed out, and England is warned to
   escape violent revolution by accommodating itself to the new age. It is
   admitted that no new system need be constructed. "Mankind (from the long
   tyranny of assumed power) have had so few opportunities of making the
   necessary trials on modes and principles of government, in order to
   discover the best, that government is but now beginning to be known, and
   experience is yet wanting to determine many particulars." Paine frankly
   retracts an old opinion of his own, that the legislature should be
   unicameral. He now thinks that, though there should be but one
   representation, it might secure wiser deliberation to divide it, by lot,
   into two or three parts. "Every proposed bill shall first be debated in
   those parts, by succession, that they may become hearers of each other,
   but without taking any vote; after which the whole representation to
   assemble, for a general debate, and determination by vote." The great
   necessity is that England shall gather its people, by representation, in
   convention and frame a constitution which shall contain the means of
   peaceful development in accordance with enlightenment and necessity.

   In Part I. Paine stated his general principles with some reservations, in
   view of the survival of royalty in the French constitution. In Part II.
   his political philosophy is -- freely and fully developed, and may be
   summarized as follows:
   1. Government is the organization of the aggregate of those natural rights
   which individuals are not competent to secure individually, and therefore
   surrender to the control of society in exchange for the protection of all
   rights.

   2. Republican government is that in which the welfare of the whole nation
   is the object.

   3. Monarchy is government, more or less arbitrary, in which the interests
   of an individual are paramount to those of the people generally.

   4. Aristocracy is government, partially arbitrary, in which the interests
   of a class are paramount to those of the people generally.

   5. Democracy is the whole people governing themselves without secondary
   means.

   6. Representative government is the control of a nation by persons elected
   by the whole nation.

   7. The Rights of Man mean the right of all to representation.
   Democracy, simple enough in small and primitive societies, degenerates
   into confusion by extension to large populations. Monarchy, which
   originated amid such confusion, degenerates into incapacity by extension
   to vast and complex interests requiring "an assemblage of practical
   knowledges which no one individual can possess." "The aristocratical form
   has the same vices and defects with the monarchical, except that the
   chance of abilities is better from the proportion of numbers."

   The representative republic advocated by Paine is different from merely
   epitomized democracy. "Representation is the delegated monarchy of a
   nation." In the early days of the American republic, when presidential
   electors were independent of the constituents who elected them, the
   filtration of democracy was a favorite principle among republicans. Paine
   evidently regards the representative as different from a delegate, or mere
   commissioner carrying out instructions. The representatives of a people
   are clothed with their sovereignty; that, and not opinions or orders, has
   been transferred to them by constituencies. Hence we find Paine, after
   describing the English people as "fools" (p.260), urging representation as
   a sort of natural selection of wisdom. 

   "Whatever wisdom constituently is, it is like a seedless plant; it may be
   reared when it appears, but it cannot be voluntarily produced. There is
   always a sufficiency somewhere in the general mass of society for all
   purposes; but, with respect to the parts of society, it is continually
   changing place. It rises in one today, in another tomorrow, and has most
   probably visited in rotation every family of the earth, and again
   withdrawn. As this is the order of nature, the order of government must
   follow it, or government will, as we see it does, degenerate into
   ignorance. The hereditary system therefore, is as repugnant to human
   wisdom as to human rights; and is as absurd as unjust. As the republic of
   letters brings forward the best literary productions, by giving to genius
   a fair and universal chance, so the representative system is calculated to
   produce the wisest laws, by collecting wisdom where it can be found."

   We have seen that "Publicola" (John Quincy Adams) in his answer to Paine's
   Part I. had left the people no right to alter government but the right of
   revolution, by violence; Erskine pointed out that Burke's pamphlet had
   similarly closed every other means of reform. Paine would civilize
   reformation: 

   "Formerly, when divisions arose respecting governments, recourse was had
   to the sword, and civil war ensued. That savage custom is exploded by the
   new system, and reference is had to national conventions. Discussion and
   the general will arbitrate the question, private opinion yields with a
   good grace, and order is preserved uninterrupted."

   Thus he is really trying to supplant the right of revolution with the
   right of evolution. 

   "It is now towards the middle of February. Were I to take a turn in the
   country the trees would present a leafless wintery appearance. As people
   are apt to pluck twigs as they go along, I perhaps might do the same, and
   by chance might observe that a single bud on that twig had begun to smell.
   I should reason very unnaturally, or rather not reason at all to suppose
   this was the only bud in England which had this appearance. Instead of
   deciding thus, I should instantly conclude that the same appearance was
   beginning, or about to begin, everywhere; and though the vegetable sleep
   will continue longer on some trees and plants than others, and though some
   of them may not blossom for two or three years, all will be in leaf in the
   summer, except those which are rotten. What pace the political summer may
   keep with the natural, no human foresight can determine. It is, however,
   not difficult to perceive that the Spring is begun. Thus wishing, as I
   sincerely do, freedom and happiness to all nations, I close the Second
   Part."

   Apparently the publisher expected trouble. In the Gazetteer, January 25th,
   had appeared the following notice: 

   "MR. PAINE, it is known, is to produce another book this season. The
   composition of this is now past, and it was given a few weeks since to two
   printers, whose presses it was to go through as soon as possible. They
   printed about half of it, and then, being alarmed by some intimations,
   refused to go further. Some delay has thus occurred, but another printer
   has taken it, and in the course of the next month it will appear. Its
   title is to be a repetition of the former, 'The Rights of Man,' of which
   the words 'Part the Second' will shew that it is a continuation."

   That the original printer, Chapman, impeded the publication is suggested
   by the fact that on February 7th, thirteen days after the above
   announcement, Paine writes: "Mr. Chapman, please to deliver to Mr. Jordan
   the remaining sheets of the "Rights of Man." And that "some intimations"
   were received by Jordan also may be inferred from the following note and
   enclosure to him: 

   "February 16, 1792.

   "For your satisfaction and my own, I send you the enclosed, tho' I do not
   apprehend there will be any occasion to use it. If, in case there should,
   you will immediately send a line for me under cover to Mr. Johnson, St.
   Paul's Church-Yard, who will forward it to me, upon which I shall come and
   answer personally for the work. Send also to Mr. Horne Tooke. 

   "T. P." 

   "February 16, 1792.

   "SIR:

   "Should any person, under the sanction of any kind of authority, enquire
   of you respecting the author and publisher of the Rights of Man, you will
   please to mention me as the author and publisher of that work, and shew to
   such person this letter. I will, as soon as I am made acquainted with it,
   appear and answer for the work personally.

   "Your humble servant, 

   "THOMAS  PAINE.

   "Mr. Jordan, No. 166 Fleet-street."

   Some copies were in Paine's hands three days before publication, as
   appears by a note of February 13th to Jefferson, on hearing of Morris'
   appointment as Minister to France. 

   "Mr. Kennedy, who brings this to New York, is on the point of setting out.
   I am therefore confined to time. I have enclosed six copies of my work for
   yourself in a parcel addressed to the President, and three or four for my
   other friends, which I wish you to take the trouble of presenting.

   "I have just heard of Governeur Morris's appointment. It is a most
   unfortunate one; and, as I shall mention the same thing to him when I see
   him, I do not express it to you with the injunction of confidence. He is
   just now arrived in London, and this circumstance has served, as I see by
   the french papers, to increase the dislike and suspicion of some of that
   nation and the National Assembly against him.

   "In the present state of Europe it would be best to make no appointments."

   Lafayette wrote Washington a strong private protest against Morris, but in
   vain. Paine spoke frankly to Morris, who mentions him on Washington's
   birthday:

   "February 22.

   "I read Paine's new publication today, and tell him that I am really
   afraid he will be punished. He seems to laugh at this, and relies on the
   force he has in the nation. He seems to become every hour more drunk with
   self-conceit. It seems, however, that his work excites but little emotion,
   and rather raises indignation. I tell him that the disordered state of
   things in France works against all schemes of reformation both here and
   elsewhere. He declares that the riots and outrages in France are nothing
   at all. It is not worth while to contest such declarations. I tell him,
   therefore, that as I am sure he does not mean what he says, I shall not
   dispute it. Visit the Duchess of Gordon, who tells me that she supposes I
   give Paine his information about America, and speaks very slightly of our
   situation, as being engaged in a civil war with the Indians. I smile, and
   tell her that Britain is also at war with Indians, though in another
   hemisphere."

   In his appendix Paine alludes vaguely to the book of George Chalmers
   ("Oldys"). 

   "A ministerial bookseller in Picadilly, who has been employed, as common
   report says, by a clerk of one of the boards closely connected with the
   Ministry (the board of Trade and Plantations, of which Lord Hawkesbury is
   president) to publish what he calls my Life (I wish his own life and that
   of the Cabinet were as good,) used to have his books printed at the same
   printing office that I employed."

   In his fifth edition Chalmers claims that this notice of his work,
   unaccompanied by any denial of its statements, is an admission of their
   truth. It looks as if Paine had not then seen the book, but he never
   further alluded to it. There was nothing in Chalmers' political or
   orthographical criticisms requiring answer, and its tar and feathers were
   so adroitly mixed, and applied with such a masterly hand, that Paine had
   to endure his literary lynching in silence. "Nothing can lie like the
   truth."145 Chalmers' libels were so ingeniously interwoven with the actual
   stumbles and humiliations of Paine's early life, that the facts could not
   be told without dragging before the public his mother's corpse, and
   breaking treaty with his divorced wife. Chalmers would have been more
   successful as a government employe in this business had he not cared more
   for himself than for his party. By advertising, as we have seen (Preface,
   xv), his first edition as a "Defence" of Paine's writings he reaped a
   pecuniary harvest from the Painites before the substitution of "Review"
   tempted the Burkites. This trick probably enraged more than it converted.
   The pompous pseudonym covered a vanity weak enough to presently drop its
   lion skin, revealing ears sufficiently long to expect for a government
   clerk the attention accorded to a reverend M.A. of the University of
   Pennsylvania. This degree was not only understood in England with a
   clerical connotation, but it competed with Paine's "M.A." from the same
   institution. The pseudonym also concealed the record of Chalmers as a Tory
   refugee from Maryland, and an opponent of Burke, long enough to sell
   several editions. But the author was known early in 1792, and was named in
   an important pamphlet by no means altogether favorable to Paine. After
   rebuking Paine for personalities towards men whose station prevents reply,
   this writer also disagrees with him about the Constitution. But he
   declares that Paine has collected the essence of the most venerated
   writers of Europe in the past, and applied the same to the executive
   government, which cannot stand the test. 

   "The Constitution will; but the present mode of administering that
   Constitution must shrink from the comparison. And this is the reason, that
   foolish Mr. Rose of the Treasury trembles on the bench, and the crafty
   clerk in Lord Hawkesbury's office, carries on his base attacks against
   Paine by sap, fights him under the mask of a Philadelphia parson, fit
   disguise for the most impudent falsehoods that ever were published, and
   stabs him in the dark. But, of this upstart clerk at the Cockpit, more
   hereafter."146

   George Chalmers being mentioned by name in this and other pamphlets, and
   nothing like a repudiation coming from him or from "Oldys" in any of his
   ten editions, the libel recoiled on the government, while it damaged
   Paine. The meanness of meeting inconvenient arguments by sniffing village
   gossip for private scandals was resented, and the calumnies were
   discounted. Nevertheless, there was probably some weakening in the
   "Painite" ranks. Although this "un-English" tracking of a man from his
   cradle, and masked assassination angered the republicans, it could hardly
   fail to intimidate some. In every period it has been seen that the largest
   interests, even the liberties, of English peoples may be placed
   momentarily at the mercy of any incident strongly exciting the moral
   sentiment. A crafty clerk accuses Paine of

   mal-treating his wife; the leader's phalanx of friends is for one instant
   disconcerted; Burke perceives the opportunity and points it out to the
   King; Pitt must show equal jealousy of royal authority; Paine is
   prosecuted147. There is little doubt that Pitt was forced to this first
   step which reversed the traditions of English freedom, and gave that
   Minister his historic place as the English Robespierre of
   counter-revolution148.

   On May 14th Paine, being at Bromley, Kent, learned that the government had
   issued summons against Jordan, his publisher. He hastened to London and
   assumed the expense of Jordan's defence. Jordan, however, privately
   compromised the affair by agreeing to plead guilty, surrender his notes
   relating to Paine, and receive a verdict to the author's prejudice -- that
   being really the end of the government's business with the publisher. On
   May 21st a summons was left on Paine at his London lodgings (Rickman's
   house) to appear at the Court of King's Bench on June 8th149. On the same
   day issued a royal proclamation against seditious writings. On May 25th,
   in the debate on the Proclamation, Secretary Dundas said in the House of
   Commons that the proceedings against Jordan were instituted because Mr.
   Paine could not be found. Thereupon Paine, detecting the unreality of the
   prosecution of his publisher, addressed a letter to the Attorney-General.
   Alluding to the remark of Dundas in Parliament, he says

   "Mr. Paine, Sir, so far from secreting himself never went a step out of
   his way, nor in the least instance varied from his usual conduct, to avoid
   any measure you might choose to adopt with respect to him. It is on the
   purity of his heart, and the universal utility of the principles and plans
   which his writings contain, that he rests the issue; and he will not
   dishonour it by any kind of subterfuge. The apartments which he occupied
   at the time of writing the work last winter, he has continued to occupy to
   the present hour, and the solicitors of the prosecution know where to find
   him; of which there is a proof in their own office, as far back as the
   21st of May, and also in the office of my own attorney. -- But admitting,
   for the sake of the case, that the reason for proceeding against the
   publication was, as Mr. Dundas stated, that Mr. Paine could not be found,
   that reason can now exist no longer. The instant that I was informed that
   an information was preparing to be filed against me as the author of, I
   believe, one of the most useful and benevolent books ever offered to
   mankind, I directed my attorney to put in an appearance; and as I shall
   meet the prosecution fully and fairly, and with a good and upright
   conscience, I have a right to expect that no act of littleness will be
   made use of on the part of the prosecution towards influencing the future
   issue with respect to the author. This expression may, perhaps, appear
   obscure to you, but I am in the possession of some matters which serve to
   show that the action against the publisher is not intended to be a real
   action."

   He then intimates that, if his suspicions should prove well-founded, he
   will withdraw from his intention of defending the publisher, and proposes
   that the case against Jordan be given up. At the close of his letter Paine
   says: 

   "I believe that Mr. Burke, finding himself defeated, has been one of the
   promoters of this prosecution; and I shall return the compliment by
   shewing, in a future publication, that he has been a masked pensioner at
   -L-1500 per annum for about ten years. Thus it is that the public money is
   wasted, and the dread of public investigation is produced."

   The secret negotiations with the publisher being thus discovered, no more
   was heard of Jordan, except that his papers were brought out at Paine's
   trial.

   The Information against Paine, covering forty-one, pages, octavo, is a
   curiosity. It recites that: 

   "Thomas Paine, late of London, gentleman, being a wicked, malicious,
   seditious, and ill-disposed person, and being greatly disaffected to our
   said Sovereign Lord the now King, and to the happy constitution and
   government of this kingdom . . . and to bring them into hatred and
   contempt, on the sixteenth day of February, in the thirty-second year of
   the reign of our said present Sovereign Lord the King, with force and arms
   at London aforesaid, to wit, in the parish of St. Mary le Bone, in the
   Ward of Cheap, he, the said Thomas, wickedly, maliciously and seditiously,
   did write and publish, and caused to be written and published, a certain
   false, scandalous, malicious, and seditious libel, of and concerning the
   said late happy Revolution, and the said settlements and limitations of
   the crown and regal governments of the said kingdoms and dominions . . .
   intituled, 'Rights of Man, Part the Second, Combining principle and
   practice.' . . . In one part thereof, according to the tenor and effect
   following, that is to say, 'All hereditary government is in its nature
   tyranny. An heritable crown' (meaning, amongst others, the crown of this
   kingdom) 'or an heritable throne,' (meaning the throne of this kingdom),'
   or by what other fanciful name such things may be called, have no other
   significant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To
   inherit a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and
   herds.' . . . 'The time is not very distant when England will laugh at
   itself for sending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brunswick, for men'
   (meaning the said King William the Third, and King George the First) 'at
   the expence of a million a year, who understood neither her laws, her
   language, nor her interest, and whose capacities would scarcely have
   fitted them for the office of a parish constable. If government could be
   trusted to such hands, it must be some easy and simple thing indeed; and
   materials fit for all the purposes may be found in every town and village
   in England.'   In contempt of our said Lord the now King and his laws, to
   the evil example of all others in like case offending, and against the
   peace of our said Lord the King, his crown and dignity. Whereupon the said
   Attorney General of our said Lord the King, who for our said Lord the King
   in this behalf, prosecuteth for our said Lord the King, prayeth the
   consideration of the court here in the premises, and that due process of
   law may be awarded against him, the said Thomas Paine, in this behalf, to
   make him answer to our said Lord the King, touching and concerning the
   premises aforesaid.

   "To this information the defendant hath appeared, and pleaded Not Guilty,
   and thereupon issue is joined."

   The specifications and quotations in the Information are reiterated twice,
   in one case (Paine's note on William and Mary centenary), three times150.
   It is marvellous that such an author, martial with "force and arms," could
   still walk freely about London. But the machinery for suppressing thought
   had always a tendency to rust in England; it had to be refurbished. To the
   royal proclamation against seditious writings corporations and rotten
   boroughs responded with loyal addresses. In the debate on that
   proclamation (May 25th) Secretary Dundas and Mr. Adam had arraigned Paine,
   and he addressed an open letter to the Secretary (June 6th) which was well
   received. Mr. Adam had said that: 

   "He had well considered the subject of constitutional publications, and
   was by no means ready to say that books of science upon government though
   recommending a doctrine or system different from the form of our
   constitution were fit objects of prosecution; that if he did, he must
   condemn Harrington for his Oceana, Sir Thomas More for his Utopia, and
   Hume for his Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth. But the publication of Mr.
   Paine reviled what was most sacred in the Constitution, destroyed every
   principle of subordination, and established nothing in their room."

   The real difficulty was that Paine had put something in the room of
   hereditary monarchy -- not a Utopia, but the representative system of the
   United States. He now again compares the governmental expenses of England
   and America and their condition. He shows that the entire government of
   the United States costs less than the English pension list alone. 

   "Here is a form and system of government that is better organized than any
   other government in the world, and that for less than one hundred thousand
   pounds, and yet every member of Congress receives as a compensation for
   his time and attendance on public business, one pound seven shillings per
   day, which is at the rate of nearly five hundred pounds a year. This is a
   government that has nothing to fear. It needs no proclamations to deter
   people from writing and reading. It needs no political superstition to
   support it. It was by encouraging discussion and rendering the press free
   upon all subjects of government, that the principles of government became
   understood in America, and the people are now enjoying their present
   blessings under it. You hear of no riots, tumults and disorders in that
   country; because there exists no cause to produce them. Those things are
   never the effect of freedom, but of restraint, oppression, and excessive
   taxation."

   On June 8th Paine appeared in court and was much disappointed by the
   postponement of his trial to December. Lord Onslow having summoned a
   meeting at Epsom of the gentry in Surrey, to respond to the proclamation,
   receives due notice. Paine sends for presentation to the gentlemen one
   hundred copies of his "Rights of Man," one thousand of his "Letter to
   Dundas." The bearer is Horne Tooke, who opens his speech of presentation
   by remarking on the impropriety that the meeting should be presided over
   by Lord Onslow, a bed-chamber lord (sinecure) at -L-1,000 with a pension
   of -L-3,000. Tooke, being cut short, his speech was continued by Paine,
   whose two letters to Onslow (June 17th and 21st) were widely
   circulated151. On June 20th was written a respectful letter to the Sheriff
   of Sussex, or other presiding officer, requesting that it be read at a
   meeting to be held in Lewes. This interesting letter has already been
   quoted in connection with Paine's early residence at Lewes. In these
   letters the author reinforces his accused book, reminds the assemblies of
   their illegal conduct in influencing the verdict in a pending matter,
   taunts them with their meanness in seeking to refute by brute force what
   forty pamphlets had failed to refute by argument.

   The meeting at Lewes, his old town, to respond to the proclamation
   occurred on the fourth of July. That anniversary of his first cause was
   celebrated by Paine also. Notified by his publisher that upwards of a
   thousand pounds stood to his credit, he directed it to be all sent as a
   present to the Society for Constitutional Information152.

   A careful tract of 1793 estimates the sales of "The Rights of Man" up to
   that year at 200,000 copies!153 In the opinion of the famous publisher of
   such literature, Richard Carlile, the king's proclamation seriously
   impeded the sale. "One part of the community is afraid to sell, and
   another to purchase, under such conditions. It is not too much to say
   that, if `Rights of Man' had obtained two or three years' free circulation
   in England and Scotland, it would have produced a similar effect to that
   which 'Common Sense' did in the United States." However, the reign of
   terror had not yet begun in France, nor the consequent reign of panic in
   England.

                                 CHAPTER  XXIII

                    THE DEPUTY FOR CALAIS IN THE CONVENTION 
                                     [1792]

   THE prosecution of Paine in England had its counterpart in a shrine across
   the channel. The Moniteur, June 17, 1792, announces the burning of Paine's
   works at "Excester," and the expulsion from Manchester of a man pointed
   out as Paine. Since April 16th his "Rights of Man," sympathetically
   translated by M. Lanthenas, had been in every French home. Paine's
   portrait, just painted in England by Romney and engraved by Sharpe, was in
   every cottage, framed in immortelles. In this book the philosophy of
   visionary reformers took practical shape. From the ashes of
   Rousseau's "Contrat Social," burnt in Paris, rose "The Rights of Man," no
   phoenix, but an eagle of the new world, with eye not blinded by any royal
   sun154. It comes to tell how by union of France and America -- of
   Lafayette and Washington -- the "Contrat Social" was framed into the
   Constitution of a happy and glorious new earth, over it a new heaven
   unclouded by priestly power or superstitions. By that book of Paine's
   (Part I), the idea of a national convention was made the purpose of the
   French leaders who were really inspired by an "enthusiasm of humanity." In
   December, 1791, when the legislature sits paralyzed under royal vetoes,
   Paine's panacea is proposed155.

   On the tenth of August, 1792, after the massacre of the Marseillese by the
   King's Swiss guards, one book, hurled from the window of the mobbed
   palace, felled an American spectator -- Robert Gilmor, of Baltimore -- who
   consoled himself by carrying it home. The book, now in the collection of
   Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, New York, was a copy of "The Thirteen
   Constitutions," translated by Franklin's order into French (1783) and
   distributed among the monarchs of Europe156. What a contrast between the
   peace and order amid which the thirteen peoples, when the old laws and
   authorities were abolished, formed new ones, and these scenes in France!  
   "For upwards of two years from the commencement of the American war,"
   wrote Paine, and a longer period, in several of the American States, there
   were no established forms of government. The old governments had been
   abolished, and the country was too much occupied in defence to employ its
   attention in establishing new governments; yet, during this interval,
   order and harmony were preserved as inviolate as in any country in
   Europe." When Burke pointed to the first riots in France, Paine could make
   a retort: the mob is what your cruel governments have made it, and only
   proves how necessary the overthrow of such governments. That French human
   nature was different from English nature he could not admit. Liberty and
   equality would soon end these troubles of transition. On that same tenth
   of August Paine's two great preliminaries are adopted the hereditary
   representative is superseded and a national convention is called. The
   machinery for such convention, the constituencies, the objects of it, had
   been read in "The Rights of Man," as illustrated in the United States and
   Pennsylvania, by every French statesman157. It was the American Republic
   they were about to found; and notwithstanding the misrepresentation of
   that nation by its surviving courtiers, these French republicans
   recognized their real American Minister: Paine is summoned.

   On August 26, 1792, the National Assembly, on proposal of M. Guadet, in
   the name of the "Commission Extraordinaire," conferred the title of French
   citizen on "Priestley, Payne [Paine], Benthom, Wilberforce, Clarkson,
   Mackintosh, David Williams, Gorani, Anacharsis Clootz, Campe, Cormelle,
   Paw, N. Pestalozzi, Washington, Hamilton, Maddison [Madison], Klopstoc,
   Kosciusko, Gilleers." Schiller was afterwards added, and on September 25th
   the Patriote announces the same title conferred on Thomas Cooper, John
   Horne Tooke, John Oswald, George Boies, Thomas Christie, Dr. Joseph
   Warner, Englishmen, and Joel Barlow, American158.

   Paine was elected to the French Convention by four different departments
   -- Oise, Puy-de-Dome, Somme, and Pas-de-Calais. The votes appear to have
   been unanimous.

   Here is an enthusiastic appeal (Riom, le 8 Septembre) signed by Louvet,
   "auteur de la Sentinelle," and thirty-two others, representing nine
   communes, to Paine, that day elected representative of Puy-de-Dome: 

   "Your love for humanity, for liberty and equality, the useful works that
   have issued from your heart and pen in their defence, have determined our
   choice. It has been hailed with universal and reiterated applause. Come,
   friend of the people, to swell the number of patriots in an assembly which
   will decide the destiny of a great people, perhaps of the human race. The
   happy period you have predicted for the nations has arrived. Come! do not
   deceive their hope!"

   But already Calais, which elected him September 6th, had sent a municipal
   officer, Achille Audibert, to London, to entreat Paine's acceptance. Paine
   was so eager to meet the English government in court, that he delayed his
   answer. But his friends had reason to fear that his martyrdom might be
   less mild than he anticipated, and urged his acceptance. There had been
   formed a society of the "Friends of Liberty," and, at its gathering of
   September 12th, Paine appears to have poured forth "inflammatory
   eloquence." At the house of his friend Johnson, on the following evening,
   Paine was reporting what he had said to some sympathizers, among them the
   mystical William Blake159, who was convinced that the speech of the
   previous night would be followed by arrest. Gilchrist's account of what
   followed is here quoted: 

   "On Paine's rising to leave, Blake laid his hand on the orator's shoulder,
   saying, 'You must not go home, or you are a dead man,' and hurried him off
   on his way to France, whither he was now in any case bound to take his
   seat as a legislator. By the time Paine was at Dover, the officers were in
   his house, [he was staying at Rickman's, in Marylebone] and, some twenty
   minutes after the Custom House officials at Dover had turned over his
   slender baggage, narrowly escaped from the English Tories. Those were
   hanging days!   Blake on the occasion showed greater sagacity than Paine,
   whom, indeed, Fuseli affirmed to be more ignorant of the common affairs of
   life than himself even. Spite of unworldliness and visionary faculty,
   Blake never wanted for prudence and sagacity in ordinary matters."160

   Before leaving London Paine managed to have an interview with the American
   Minister, Pinckney, who thought he could do good service in the
   Convention.

   Mr. Frost, who accompanied Paine and Audibert, had information of certain
   plans of the officials. He guided them to Dover by a circuitous route --
   Rochester, Sandwich, Deal. With what emotions does our world-wanderer find
   himself in the old town where he married and suffered with his first love,
   Mary Lambert, whose grave is near!   Nor is he so far from Cranbrook,
   where his wife receives her mysterious remittances, but since their
   separation "has not heard of" this said Thomas Paine, as her testimony
   goes some years later. Paine is parting from England and its ghosts
   forever. The travellers find Dover excited by the royal proclamation. The
   collector of customs has had general instructions to be vigilant, and
   searches the three men, even to their pockets. Frost pretended a desire to
   escape, drawing the scent from Paine. In his report (September 15th) of
   the search to Mr. Dundas, Paine says: 

   "Among the letters which he took out of my trunk were two sealed letters,
   given into my charge by the American minister in London [Pinckney], one of
   which was addressed to the American minister at Paris, the other to a
   private gentleman; a letter from the president of the United States, and a
   letter from the secretary of State in America, both directed to me, and
   which I had received from the American minister, now in London, and were
   private letters of friendship; a letter from the electoral body, of the
   department of Calais, containing the notification of my being elected to
   the National Convention; and a letter from the president of the National
   Assembly informing me of my being also elected for the department of the
   Oise [Versailles]. . . . When the collector had taken what papers and
   letters he pleased out of the trunks, he proposed to read them. The first
   letter he took up for this purpose was that from the president of the
   United States to me. While he was doing this I said, that it was very
   extraordinary that General Washington could not write a letter of private
   friendship to me, without its being subject to be read by a customhouse
   officer. Upon this Mr. Frost laid his hand over the face of the letter,
   and told the collector that he should not read it, and took it from him.
   Mr. Frost then, casting his eyes on the concluding paragraph of the
   letter, said, I will read this part to you, which he did; of which the
   following is an exact transcript. -- 'And as no one can feel a greater
   interest in the happiness of mankind than I do, it is the first wish of my
   heart that the enlightened policy of the present age may diffuse to all
   men those blessings to

   which they are entitled and lay the foundation of happiness for future
   generations.' "

   So Washington's nine months' delay in acknowledging Paine's letter and
   gift of fifty volumes had brought his letter in the nick of time. The
   collector quailed before the President's signature. He took away the
   documents, leaving a list of them, and they were presently returned. Soon
   afterward the packet sailed, and "twenty minutes later" the order for
   Paine's arrest reached Dover. Too late! Baffled pursuers gnash their
   teeth, and Paine passes to his ovation.

   What the ovation was to be, he could hardly anticipate even from the
   cordial, or glowing, letter of Herault Sechelles summoning him to the
   Convention, -- a fine translation of which by Cobbett is given in the
   Appendix. Ancient Calais, in its time, had received heroes from across the
   channel, but hitherto never with joy. That honor the centuries reserved
   for a Thetford Quaker. As the packet sails in a salute is fired from the
   battery; cheers sound along the shore. As the representative for Calais
   steps on French soil soldiers make his avenue, the officers embrace him,
   the national cockade is presented. A beautiful lady advances, requesting
   the honor of setting the cockade in his hat, and makes him a pretty
   speech, ending with Liberty, Equality, and France. As they move along the
   Rue de l'Egalite (late Rue du Roi) the air rings with "Vive Thomas
   Paine!"161 At the town hall he is presented to the Municipality, by each
   member embraced, by the Mayor also addressed. At the meeting of the
   Constitutional Society of Calais, in the Minimes, he sirs beside the
   president, beneath the bust of Mirabeau and the united colors of France,
   England, and America. There is an official ceremony announcing his
   election, and plaudits of the crowd, "Vive la Nation!" "Vive Thomas
   Paine!" The Minimes proving too small, the meeting next day is held in the
   church, where martyred saints and miraculous Madonnas look down on this
   miraculous Quaker, turned savior of society. In the evening, at the
   theatre, a box is decorated "For the Author of 'The Rights of Man.' "

   Thus for once our wayfarer, so marked by time and fate, received such
   welcome as hitherto had been accorded only to princes. Alas, that the aged
   eyes which watched over his humble cradle could not linger long enough to
   see a vision of this greatness, or that she who bore the name of Elizabeth
   Paine was too far out of his world as not even to know that her husband
   was in Europe. A theatrical La France must be his only bride, and in the
   end play the role of a cruel stepmother. When Washington was on his way to
   his inauguration in New York, passing beneath triumphal arches, amid
   applauding crowds, a sadness came over him as he reflected, so he wrote a
   friend, how easily all this enthusiasm might be reversed by a failure in
   the office for which he felt himself so little competent. But for Paine on
   his way to sit in the Convention of a People's representatives -- one
   summoned by his own pen for objects to which his life was devoted, for
   which he had the training of events as well as studies, -- for him there
   could be no black star hovering over his welcome and his triumphal pathway
   to Paris. For, besides his fame, there had preceded him to every town
   rumors of how this representative of man -- of man in America, England,
   France -- had been hunted by British oppressors down to the very edge of
   their coast. Those outwitted pursuers had made Paine a greater power in
   France than he might otherwise have been. The Moniteur (September 23d)
   told the story, and adds "Probably M. Payne will have been indemnified for
   such injustices by the brilliant reception accorded him on his arrival on
   French soil."

   Other representatives of Calais were Personne, Carnat, Bollet, Magniez,
   Varlet, Guffroy, Eulard, Duquesnoy, Lebas, Daunon. It could hardly be
   expected that there should be no jealousy of the concentration of
   enthusiasm on the brilliant Anglo-American. However, none of this yet
   appeared, and Paine glided flower-crowned in his beautiful barge, smoothly
   toward his Niagara rapids. He had, indeed, heard the distant roar, in such
   confused, hardly credited, rumors of September massacres as had reached
   London, but his faith in the National Convention was devout. All the riots
   were easily explained by the absence of that charm. He had his flask of
   constitutional oil, other representatives no doubt had theirs, and when
   they gathered on September 21st, amid equinoctial gales, the troubled
   waters would be still.

   Paine reached White's Hotel, Paris162, September 19th; on the 20th attends
   a gathering of the "Conventionnels"; on the 21st moves in their procession
   to the Tuileries, for verification of credentials by the expiring
   Assembly, repairing with them for work in the Salle du Manege. He was
   introduced by the Abbe Gregoire, and received with acclamations.

   On September 21st, then, the Year One opens. It greets mankind with the
   decree: "Royalty is from this day abolished in France."163

   September 22d, on a petition from Orleans, Danton proposes removal of the
   entire administrative corps, municipal and judicial, to prevent their
   removal by popular violence. Paine (through Goupilleau) suggests
   postponement for more thorough discussion. Having got rid of kings they
   must be rid of royal hirelings; but if partial reforms are made in the
   judiciary system those institutions cannot possess coherence; for the
   present persons might be changed without altering laws; finally, justice
   cannot be administered by men ignorant of the laws. Danton welcomes
   Paine's views, and it is decreed that the administrative bodies be renewed
   by popular election; but the limitations on eligibility, fixed by the
   Constitution of 1791, are abolished -- the judge need not be a lawyer, nor
   the municipal officer a proprietor.

   On September 25th appears Paine's letter to his "Fellow Citizens,"
   expressing his "affectionate gratitude" for his adoption and his election.
   "My felicity is increased by seeing the barrier broken down that divided
   patriotism by spots of earth, and limited citizenship to the soil, like
   vegetation." The letter is fairly "floreal" with optimistic felicities.
   "An over-ruling Providence is regenerating the old world by the principles
   of the new." "It is impossible to conquer a nation determined to be free."
   "It is now the cause of all nations against the cause of all courts." "In
   entering on this great scene, greater than any nation has been called to
   act in, let us say to the agitated mind, be calm!   Let us punish by
   instruction, rather than by revenge. Let us begin the new era by a
   greatness of friendship, and hail the approach of union and success."

   October 11th, a committee to frame a constitution is appointed, consisting
   of Sieyes, Paine, Brissot, Petion, Vergniaud, Gensonne, Barrere, Danton,
   Condorcet. Supplementary -- Barbaroux, Herault Sechelles, Lanthenas,
   Debry, the Abbe Fauchet, Lavicourterie. Paine was placed second to his old
   adversary, Sieyes, only because of his unfamiliarity with French. At least
   four of the committee understood English -- Condorcet, Danton, Barrere,
   and Brissot. Paine had known Brissot in America, their friendship being
   caused by literary tastes in common, and the zeal of both for negro
   emancipation.

   On October 25th was written for Le Patriote Franc,ais (edited by Brissot)
   an address by Paine arguing carefully the fallacies of royalism. He
   tersely expresses the view now hardly paradoxical, that "a talented king
   is worse than a fool." 

   "We are astonished at reading that the Egyptians set upon the throne a
   stone, which they called king. Well! such a monarch was less absurd and
   less mischievous than those before whom nations prostrate themselves. At
   least he deceived no one. None supposed that he possessed qualities or a
   character. They did not call him Father of his People; and yet it would
   have been scarcely more ridiculous than to give such a title to a
   blockhead (un etourdi) whom the right of succession crowns at eighteen. A
   dumb idol is better than one animated."164

   In this letter Paine adroitly prepares the way for his purpose of saving
   the life of Louis XVI., for whose blood the thirst is growing. "It is
   little," he says, "to overthrow the idol; it is the pedestal which must
   especially be beaten down. It is the kingly office, rather than the
   officer, that is destructive (meurtriere). This is not seen by every one."

   In those who sympathized with the human spirit of his views Paine inspired
   deep affection. A volume might be filled with the personal tributes to
   him. In Paris he was the centre of a loving circle, from the first. "I
   lodge," writes Lord Edward Fitzgerald to his mother (October 30th), "with
   my friend Paine -- we breakfast, dine, and sup together. The more I see of
   his interior, the more I like and respect him. I cannot express how kind
   he is to me; there is a simplicity of manner, a goodness of heart, and a
   strength of mind in him, that I never knew a man before possess."165

   Paine was chosen by his fellow-deputies of Calais to offer the Convention
   the congratulations of their department on the abolition of onarchy. This
   letter, written October 27th, was on that day read in Convention, in
   French,

   "CITIZEN PRESIDENT;

   In the name of the deputies of the department of Pas de Calais, I have the
   honor of presenting to the Convention the felicitations of the General
   Council of the Commune of Calais on the abolition of royalty.

   "Amid the joy inspired by this event, one can not forbear some pain at the
   folly of our ancestors, who have placed us under the necessity of treating
   seriously (solennellement) the abolition of a phantom. 

   "THOMAS  PAINE, Deputy, etc."166

   The Moniteur, without printing the letter, says that applause followed the
   word "fantome." The use of this word was a resumption of Paine's effort to
   save the life of the king, then a prisoner of state, by a suggestion of
   his insignificance167. But he very soon realizes the power of the phantom,
   which lies not only in the monarchical Trade Union of Europe but in the
   superstition of monarchy in those who presently beheaded poor Louis. Paine
   was always careful to call him Louis Capet, but the French deputies took
   the king seriously to the last. The king's divine foot was on their necks
   in the moment when their axe was on his. But Paine feared a more terrible
   form which had arisen in place of the royal prisoner of the Temple. On the
   fourth day of the Convention Marat arose with the words, "It seems a great
   many here are my enemies," and received the shouted answer, "All! all!"
   Paine had seen Marat hypnotize the Convention, and hold it subdued in the
   hollow of his hand. Here was King Stork ready to succeed King Log.

   But what has the Convention to do with deciding about Louis XVI., or about
   affairs, foreign or domestic? It is there like the Philadelphia Convention
   of 1787; its business is to frame a Constitution, then dissolve, and let
   the organs it created determine special affairs. So the committee work
   hard on the Constitution; "Deputy Paine and France generally expect,"
   finds Carlyle, "all finished in a few months." But, alas, the phantom is
   too strong for the political philosophers. The crowned heads of Europe are
   sinking their differences for a time and consulting about this imprisoned
   brother. And at the same time the subjects of those heads are looking
   eagerly towards the Convention168.

   The foreign menaces had thus far caused the ferocities of the revolution,
   for France knew it was worm-eaten with enemies of republicanism. But now
   the Duke of Brunswick had retreated, the French arms were victorious
   everywhere; and it is just possible that the suicide of the Republic --
   the Reign of Terror -- might never have been completed but for that
   discovery (November 10th) of secret papers walled up in the Tuileries.
   These papers compromised many, revealed foreign schemes, and made all
   Paris shriek "Treason!" The smith (Gamain) who revealed the locality of
   that invisible iron press which he had set under the wainscot, made a good
   deal of history that day.

   A cry for the king's life was raised, for to France he was the head and
   front of all conspiracy.

   How everybody bent under the breath of those days may be seen in the fact
   that even Gouverneur Morris is found writing to Lord Wycombe (November
   22d): "All who wish to partake thereof [freedom] will find in us (ye
   French) a sure and certain ally. We will chase tyranny, and, above
   all, aristocracy, off the theatre of the Universe."169

   Paine was living in the "Passage des Petites Peres, No. 7." There are now
   two narrow passages of that name, uniting near the church "Notre Dame des
   Victoires," which still bears the words, "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite."
   No. 7 has disappeared as a number, but it may have described a part of
   either No. 8 or No. 9, -- both ancient. Here he was close to a chapel of
   the Capucines, unless, indeed, it had already been replaced by this
   church, whose interior walls are covered with tablets set up by
   individuals in acknowledgment of the Virgin's miraculous benefits to them.
   Here he might study superstition, and no doubt did; but on November 10th
   he has to deal with the madness of a populace which has broken the outer
   chains of superstition with a superstition of their own, one without
   restraints to replace the chains. Beneath his window the Place des
   Victoires will be crowded with revolutionists, frantic under rumors of the
   discovered iron press and its treasonable papers. He could hardly look out
   without seeing some poor human scape-goat seeking the altar's safety. Our
   Lady will look on him from her church the sad-eyed inquiry: "Is this,
   then, the new religion of Liberty, with which you supplant the Mother and
   Babe?"

   Paine has carried to success his anti-monarchical faith. He was the first
   to assail monarchy in America and in France. A little more than a year
   before, he had founded the first Republican Society in Europe, and written
   its Declaration on the door of the National Assembly. Sieyes had denounced
   him then as a "polyarchist." Now he sat with Sieyes daily, framing a
   republican Constitution, having just felicitated the Convention on the
   abolition of the phantom -- Royalty. And now, on this terrible night of
   November 20th, this unmaker of kings finds himself the solitary deputy
   ready to risk his life to save the man whose crown he had destroyed. It is
   not simply because the old Quaker heart in him recoils from bloodshed, but
   that he would save the Republic from the peril of foreign invasion, which
   would surely follow the execution of Louis, and from disgrace in America,
   whose independence owed much to the fallen monarch.

   In his little room, the lonely author, unable to write French, animated by
   sentiments which the best of the French revolutionists could not
   understand -- Danton reminding him that "revolutions are not made of
   rose-water" -- must have before the morrow's Convention some word that
   shall control the fury of the moment. Rose-water will not answer now.
   Louis must pass his ordeal; his secret schemes have been revealed; the
   treachery of his submissions to the people exposed. He is guilty, and the
   alternatives are a calm trial, or death by the hands of the mob. What is
   now most needed is delay, and, that secured, diversion of national rage
   from the individual Louis to the universal anti-republican Satan inspiring
   the crowned heads of Europe. Before the morning dawns, Paine has written
   his letter to the president. It is translated before the Convention meets,
   November 21st, and is read to that body the same day170. Louis XVI., he
   says, should be tried. The advice is not suggested by vengeance, but by
   justice and policy. If innocent, he may be allowed to prove it; if guilty,
   he must be punished or pardoned by the nation. He would, however, consider
   Louis, individually, beneath the notice of the republic. The importance of
   his trial is that there is a conspiracy of "crowned brigands" against the
   liberties not only of France, but of all nations, and there is ground for
   suspecting that Louis XVI. was a partner in it. He should be utilized to
   ferret out the whole gang, and reveal to the various peoples what their
   monarchs, some of whom work in secret for fear of their subjects, are
   doing. Louis XVI. should not be dealt with except in the interest of all
   Europe. 

   "If, seeing in Louis XVI. only a weak and narrow-minded man, badly reared,
   as all like him, subject, it is said, to intemperance, imprudently
   re-established by the Constituent Assembly on a throne for which he was
   unfit, -- if we hereafter show him some compassion, this compassion should
   be the effect of national magnanimity, and not a result of the burlesque
   notion of pretended inviolability."171

   Lamartine, in his history of the Girondists, reproaches Paine for these
   words concerning a king who had shown him friendship during the American
   war. But the facts were not well explored in Lamartine's time. Louis Blanc
   recognizes Paine's intent172. "He had learned in England that killing a
   monarch -- does not kill monarchs." This grand revolutionary proposal to
   raise the inevitable trial from the low plane of popular wrath against a
   prisoner to the dignity of a process against European monarchy, would have
   secured delay and calmer counsels. If the reader, considering the newly
   discovered papers, and the whole situation, will examine critically
   Paine's words just quoted, he will find them meriting a judgment the
   reverse of Lamartine's. With consummate art, the hourly imperilled king is
   shielded from vindictive wrath by the considerations that he is non
   compos, not responsible for his bringing up, was put back on the throne by
   the Assembly, after he had left it, acknowledging his unfitness, and that
   compassion for him would be becoming to the magnanimity of France. A plea
   for the King's immunity from trial, for his innocence or his virtues,
   would at that juncture have been fatal. As it was, this ingenious document
   made an impression on the Convention, which ordered it to be printed173.

   The delay which Paine's proposal would involve was, as Louis Blanc
   remarks, fatal to it. It remains now only to work among the members of the
   Convention, and secure if possible a majority that will be content, having
   killed the king, to save the man; and, in saving him, to preserve him as
   an imprisoned hostage for the good behavior of Europe. This is now Paine's
   idea, and never did man toil more faithfully for another than he did for
   that discrowned Louis Capet.

                                        

                                 CHAPTER XXIV.

                              OUTLAWED IN ENGLAND 
                                  [1792-1793]

   WHILE Paine was thus, towards the close of 1792, doing the work of a
   humane Englishman in France, his works were causing a revolution in
   England -- a revolution the more effectual because bloodless.

   In Paine's letter to Secretary Dundas (Calais, September 15th), describing
   the examination of his papers at Dover, a "postscript" states that among
   the papers handled was "a printed proof copy of my Letter to the
   Addressers, which will soon be published." This must have been a
   thumbscrew for the Secretary when he presently read the pamphlet that
   escaped his officers. In humor, freedom, and force this production may be
   compared with Carlyle's "Latter Day Pamphlets." Lord Stormont and Lord
   Grenville having made speeches about him, their services are returned by a
   speech which the author has prepared for them to deliver in Parliament.
   This satirical eulogy on the British constitution set the fashion for
   other radical encomiums of the wisdom of the king and of the peers, the
   incorruptibility of the commons, beauty of rotten boroughs, and freedom of
   the people from taxes174, with which prosecuting attorneys were unable to
   deal. Having felicitated himself on the circulation of his opinions by the
   indictment, and the advertisements of his books by loyal "Addresses,"
   Paine taunts the government for its method of answering argument. It had
   been challenging the world for a hundred years to admire the perfection of
   its institutions. At length the challenge is taken up, and, lo, its
   acceptance is turned into a crime, and the only defence of its perfection
   is a prosecution Paine points out that there was no sign of prosecution
   until his book was placed within reach of the poor. When cheap editions
   were clamored for by Sheffield, Leicester, Chester, Warwickshire, and
   Scotland, he had announced that any one might freely publish it. About the
   middle of April he had himself put a cheap edition in the press. He knew
   he would be prosecuted for that, and so wrote to Thomas Walker175. It was
   the common people the government feared. He remarks that on the same day
   (May 21st) the prosecution was instituted and the royal proclamation
   issued -- the latter being indictable as an effort to influence the
   verdict in a pending case. He calls attention to the "special jury,"
   before which he was summoned. It is virtually selected by the Master of
   the Crown Office, a dependant on the Civil List assailed in his book. The
   special jury is treated to a dinner, and given two guineas for a
   conviction, and but one guinea and no dinner for acquittal. Even a fairly
   selected local jury could not justly determine a constitutional issue
   affecting every part of the empire. So Paine brings under scrutiny every
   part of the legal machinery sprung on him, adding new illustrations of his
   charges against the whole system. He begins the siege, which Bradlaugh was
   to carry forward in a later time, against the corrupt Pension List,
   introducing it with his promised exposure of Edmund Burke. Near the end of
   Lord North's administration Burke brought in a bill by which it was
   provided that a pension or annuity might be given without name, if under
   oath that it was not for the benefit of a member of the House of Commons.
   Burke's pension had been taken out under the name of another man; but
   being under the necessity of mortgaging it, the real pensioner had to be
   disclosed to the mortgagee176. For the rest, this "Address to the
   Addressers," as it was popularly called, -- or "Part Third of the Rights
   of Man," as one publisher entitled it, -- sowed broadcast through England
   passages that were recited in assemblies, and sentences that became
   proverbs.

   "It is a dangerous attempt in any government to say to a Nation, Thou
   shalt not read."

   "Thought, by some means or other, is got abroad in the world, and cannot
   be restrained, though reading may."

   "Whatever the rights of the people are, they have a right to them; and
   none have a right either to withhold or to grant them."

   "The project of hereditary Governors and Legislatures was a treasonable
   usurpation over the rights of posterity."

   "Put a country right, and it will soon put government right."

   "When the rich plunder the poor of his rights, it becomes an example to
   the poor to plunder the rich of his property."

   "Who are those that are frightened at reform? Are the public afraid their
   taxes should be lessened too much? Are they afraid that sinecure places
   and pensions should be abolished too fast? Are the poor afraid that their
   condition should be rendered too comfortable?"

   "A thing moderately good is not so good as it ought to be."

   "If to expose the fraud and imposition of monarchy, and every species of
   hereditary government -- to lessen the oppression of taxes -- to propose
   plans for the education of helpless infancy, and the comfortable support
   of the aged and distressed -- to endeavour to conciliate nations with each
   other to extirpate the horrid practice of war -- to promote universal
   peace, civilization, and commerce -- and to break the chains of political
   superstition, and raise degraded man to his proper rank -- if these things
   be libellous, let me live the life of a Libeller, and let the name of
   Libeller be engraven on my tomb,"

   Two eminent personages were burnt in effigy in Europe about this time, one
   in France, the other in England: Paine and the Pope.

   Under date of December 19th, the American minister (Morris) enters in his
   diary: 

   "Several Americans dine with me. Paine looks a little down at the news
   from England; he has been burned in effigy."

   This was the reply of the Addressers, the noble men and gentry, to Paine's
   "Letter." It is said that on the Fifth of November it was hinted to the
   boys that their Guy Fawkes would extort more pennies if labelled "Tom
   Paine," and that thenceforth the new Guy paraded with a pair of stays
   under his arm177. The holocaust of Paines went on through December178,
   being timed for the author's trial, set for the eighteenth. One gets
   glimpses in various local records and memoirs of the agitation in
   England179. Thus in Mrs. Henry Sandford's account of Thomas Poole180, we
   read in Charlotte Poole's journal:

   "December 18, 1792.

   "John dined with Tom Poole, and from him heard that there was a great
   bustle at Bridgwater yesterday -- that Tom Paine was burnt in Effigy, and
   that he saw Richard Symes sitting on the Cornhill with a table before him,
   receiving the oaths of loyalty to the king, and affection to the present
   constitution, from the populace. I fancy this could not have been a very
   pleasant sight to Tom Poole, for he has imbibed some of the wild notions
   of liberty and equality that at present prevail so much: and it is but
   within these two or three days that a report has been circulated that he
   has distributed seditious pamphlets to the common people of Stowey. But
   this report is entirely without foundation. Everybody at this time talks
   politicks, and is looking with anxiety for fresh intelligence from France
   which is a scene of guilt and confusion."

   In Richardson's "Borderer's Table Book" is recorded: 

   "1792 (Dec.)

   "This is month, Thomas Paine, author of the `Rights of Man,' &c. &c., was
   burnt at most of the towns and considerable villages in Northumberland and
   Durham."

   No doubt, among the Durham towns, Wearmouth saw at the stake an effigy of
   the man whose iron bridge, taken down at Paddington, and sold for other
   benefit than Paine's, was used in spanning the Wear with the arch of his
   invention: all amid shouts of "God save the King," and plaudits for the
   various public-spirited gentlemen and architects, who patriotically
   appropriated the merits and patent of the inventor. The Bury
   Post (published near Paine's birthplace) says, December 12th: 

   "The populace in different places have been lately amusing themselves by
   burning effigies. As the culprit on whom they meant to execute this
   punishment was Thomas Paine, they were not interrupted by any power civil
   or military. The ceremony has been at Croydon in Surrey, at Warrington, at
   Lymington, and at Plymouth."

   "January 9, 1793

   "On Saturday last the effigy of Thomas Paine was carried round the town of
   Swaffham, and afterwards hung on a gibbet, erected on the market-hill for
   that purpose. In the evening his remains were committed to the flames
   amidst acclamations of God save the King, etc."181

   The trial of Paine for high treason was by a Special Jury in the Court of
   King's Bench, Guildhall, on Tuesday, December 18, 1792, before Lord,
   Kenyon182. The "Painites" had probably little hope of acquittal. In
   Rickman's journal (manuscript) he says: "C. Lofft told me he knew a
   gentleman who tried for five or six years to be on the special juries, but
   could not, being known to be a liberty man. He says special juries are
   packed to all intents and purposes." The reason for gathering such
   powerful counsel for defence must have been to obtain from the trial some
   definitive adjudication on the legal liabilities of writers and printers,
   and at the same time to secure, through the authority of Erskine, an
   affirmation of their constitutional rights. Lord Loughborough and others
   vainly tried to dissuade Erskine from defending Paine. For himself, Paine
   had given up the case some time before, and had written from Paris,
   November 11th, to the Attorney-General, stating that, having been called
   to the Convention in France, he could not stay to contest the prosecution,
   as he wished. 

   "My necessary absence from your country affords the opportunity of knowing
   whether the prosecution was intended against Thomas Paine, or against the
   Rights of the People of England to investigate systems and principles of
   government; for as I cannot now be the object of the prosecution, the
   going on with the prosecution will show that something else was the
   object, and that something else can be no other than the People of
   England. . . . But I have other reasons than those I have mentioned for
   writing you this letter; and however you chuse to interpret them they
   proceed from a good heart. The time, Sir, is becoming too serious to play
   with Court prosecutions, and sport with national rights. The terrible
   examples that have taken place here upon men who, less than a year ago,
   thought themselves as secure as any prosecuting judge, jury, or
   Attorney-General can do now in England, ought to have some weight with men
   in your situation.

   That the Government of England is as great, if not the greatest perfection
   of fraud and corruption that ever took place since governments began, is
   what you cannot be a stranger to; unless the constant habit of seeing it
   has blinded your sense. But though you may not chuse to see it, the people
   are seeing it very fast, and the progress is beyond what you may chuse to
   believe. Is it possible that you or I can believe, or that reason can make
   any other man believe, that the capacity of such a man as Mr. Guelph, or
   any of his profligate sons, is necessary to the government of a nation? I
   speak to you as one man ought to speak to another: and I know also that I
   speak what other people are beginning to think. That you cannot obtain a
   verdict (and if you do it will signify nothing) without packing a Jury,
   and we both know that such tricks are practised, is what I have very good
   reason to believe. . . .

   Do not then, Sir, be the instrument of drawing away twelve men into a
   situation that may be injurious to them afterwards. I do not speak this
   from policy, but from benevolence; but if you chuse to go on with the
   process, I make it my request that you would read this letter in Court,
   after which the judge and the jury may do what they please. As I do not
   consider myself the object of the prosecution, neither can I be affected
   by the issue one way or the other, I shall, though a foreigner in your
   country, subscribe as much money as any other man towards supporting the
   right of the nation against the prosecution; and it is for this purpose
   only that I shall do it. As I have not time to copy letters, you will
   excuse the corrections."

   A month after this awful letter was written, Paine no doubt knew its
   imprudence183. It was sprung on the Court by the Attorney-General, and
   must alone have settled the verdict, had it not been foregone. Erskine,
   Paine's leading counsel, was Attorney-General for the Prince of Wales --
   foremost of "Mr. Guelph's profligate sons," -- and he was compelled to
   treat as a forgery the letter all felt to be genuine. He endeavored to
   prevent the reading of it, but Lord Kenyon decided that "in prosecutions
   for high treason, where overt acts are laid, you may prove overt acts not
   laid to prove those that are laid. If it [the letter] goes to prove him
   the author of the book, I am bound to admit it." Authorship of the book
   being admitted, this was only a pretext. The Attorney-General winced a
   good deal at the allusion to the profligate sons, and asked: 

   "Is he [Paine] to teach human creatures, whose moments of existence depend
   upon the permission of a Being, merciful, long-suffering, and of great
   goodness, that those whose youthful errors, from which even royalty is not
   exempted, are to be treasured up in a vindictive memory, and are to
   receive sentence of irremissible sin at His hands?"

   It may be incidentally remarked here that the Attorney-General could
   hardly have failed to retort with charges against the author, had not
   Paine's reputation remained proof against the libellous "biography" by the
   government clerk, Chalmers.

   The main part of the prosecution was thus uttered by Paine himself. While
   reading the letter the prosecutor paused to say: "If I succced in this
   prosecution he shall never return to this country otherwise than in
   vinculis, for I will outlaw him."184

   Erskine's powerful defence of the constitutional rights of thought and
   speech in England is historical. He built around Paine an enduring
   constitutional fortress, compelling Burke and Fox to lend aid from their
   earlier speeches. The fable with which he closed was long remembered. 

   "Constraint is the natural parent of resistance, and a pregnant proof that
   reason is not on the side of those who use it. You must all remember,
   gentlemen, Lucian's pleasant story Jupiter and a countryman were walking
   together, conversing with great freedom and familiarity upon the subject
   of heaven and earth. The countryman listened with attention and
   acquiescence, while Jupiter strove only to convince him: but happening to
   hint a doubt, Jupiter turned hastily around and threatened him with his
   thunder. `Ah, ha !' says the countryman, `now, Jupiter, I know that you
   are wrong; you are always wrong when you appeal to your thunder.'

   "This is the case with me. I can reason with the people of England, but I
   cannot fight against the thunder of authority."

   Mr. Attorney-General arose immediately to reply to Mr. Erskine, when Mr.
   Campbell (the foreman of the jury) said: "My Lord, I am authorized by the
   jury here to inform the Attorney-General that a reply is not necessary for
   them, unless the Attorney-General wishes to make it, or your Lordship."
   Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the jury gave in their verdict -
   Guilty185.

   Paine was outlawed.

   The eye of England followed its outlaw before and after his trial. In the
   English state archives is a note of G. Munro to Lord Grenville, September
   8th, announcing "Mr. Payne's" election for the Departement de l'Oise. Earl
   Gower announces, on information of Mr. Mason, that "Tom Payne is on his
   road to take his seat." On September 22d a despatch mentions Paine's
   speech on the judiciary question. "December 17, 1792. Tom Payne is in the
   country unwell, or pretending to be so." The most remarkable of the secret
   despatches, however, are two sent from Paris on the last day of the year
   1792. One of these alludes to the effect of Paine's trial and outlawry on
   the English radicals in Paris: 

   "Tom Payne's fate and the unanimity of the English has staggered the
   boldest of them, and they are now dwindling into nothing. Another address
   was, however, proposed for the National Convention: this motion, I
   understand, was made by Tom Payne and seconded by Mr. Mery: it was opposed
   by Mr. Frost, seconded by Mr. McDonald."

   The second allusion to Paine on December 31st deserves to be pondered by
   historians: 

   "Tom Payne has proposed banishing the royal family of France, and I have
   heard is writing his opinion on the subject; his consequence seems daily
   lessening in this country, and I should never be surprised if he some day
   receives the fate he merits."

   It thus seems that whatever good deed Paine was about, he deserves death.
   Earl Gower, and the agents he left on his departure (September) in Paris,
   must have known that Paine's proposal was the only alternative of the
   king's execution, and that if his consequence was lessening it was solely
   because of labors to save the lives of the royal family. This humane man
   has the death-sentence of Robespierre on him anticipated by the ambassador
   of a country which, while affecting grief for Louis XVI., was helping on
   his fate186.

   Danton said to Count Theodore de Lameth: 

   "I am willing to try and save the King, but I must have a million of money
   to buy up the necessary votes, and the money must be on hand in eight
   days. I warn you that although I may save his life I shall vote for his
   death; I am quite willing to save his head, but not to lose mine."

   The Count and the Spanish Ambassador broached the matter to Pitt, who
   refused the money187. He was not willing to spend a few thousands to save
   the life of America's friend, though he made his death a pretext for
   exhausting his treasury to deluge Europe with blood.

   Gouverneur Morris, whose dislike of Paine's republicanism was equally
   cynical188, was intimate with Earl Gower, and no doubt gave him his
   nformation. Morris was clear-headed enough to perceive that the massacres
   in France were mainly due to the menaces of foreign monarchs, and was in
   hearty sympathy with Paine's plan for saving the life of Louis XVI. On
   December 28th he writes to Washington that a majority of the Convention: 

   "have it in contemplation not only to refer the judgment to the electors
   of France, that is, to her people, but also to send him and his family to
   America, which Paine is to move for. He mentioned this to me in
   confidence, but I have since heard it from another quarter."

   On January 6, 1793, Morris writes to Washington concerning Genet, the new
   Minister to the United States, who had been introduced to him by Paine,
   and dined with him. At the close he says: 

   "The King's fate is to be decided next Monday the 14th. That unhappy man,
   conversing with one of his council on his own fate, calmly summed up the
   motives of every kind, and concluded that a majority of the Council
   [Convention] would vote for referring his case to the people, and that in
   consequence he should be massacred. I think he must die or reign."

   Paine also feared that a reference to the populace meant death. He had
   counted a majority in the Convention who were opposed to the execution.
   Submission of the question to the masses would thus, if his majority stood
   firm, be risking the life of Louis again. Unfortunately this question had
   to be determined before the vote on life or death. At the opening of the
   year 1793 he felt cheerful about the situation. On January 3d he wrote to
   John King, a retreating comrade in England, as follows:

   "DEAR  KING,

   "I don't know anything, these many years, that surprised and hurt me more
   than the sentiments you published in the Courtly HERALD, the 12th
   December, signed John King, Egham Lodge. You have gone back from all you
   ever said. When I first knew you in Ailiffe-street, an obscure part of the
   city, a child, without fortune or friends, I noticed you: because I
   thought I saw in you, young as you was, a bluntness of temper, a boldness
   of opinion, and an originality of thought, that portended some future
   good. I was pleased to discuss with you, under our friend Oliver's
   lime-tree, those political notions which I have since given the world in
   my `Rights of Man.'

   "You used to complain of abuses as well as me. What, then, means this
   sudden attachment to Rings? this fondness of the English Government, and
   hatred of the French? If you mean to curry favour, by aiding your
   Government, you are mistaken: they never recompence those who serve it:
   they buy off those who can annoy it, and let the good that is rendered it
   be its own reward. Believe me, KING, more is to be obtained by cherishing
   the rising spirit of the People, than by subduing it. Follow my fortunes,
   and I will be answerable that you shall make your own. 
   "THOMAS  PAINE"189

   "This last sentence may even now raise a smile. King must subsequently
   have reflected with satisfaction that he did not "follow the fortunes" of
   Paine, which led him into prison at the end of the year. A third letter
   from him to Paine appeared in the Morning Herald, April 17, 1793, in which
   he says:

   " 'If the French kill their king, it will be a signal for my departure,
   for I will not abide among such sanguinary men.'   These, Mr. Paine, were
   your words at our last meeting; yet after this you are not only with them,
   but the chief modeller of their new Constitution."

   Mr. King might have reflected that the author of the "Rights of
   Man," which he had admired, was personally safer in regicide France than
   in liberticide England, which had outlawed him.

   of Thetford." A very valuable contribution to local history.

   2.     I am indebted to Mr. G. J. Holyoake for documents that shed full
   light on an incident which Oldys has carefully left in the half-light
   congenial to his insinuations. The minute of the Board of Excise, dated 27
   August, 1765, is as follows: 

   "Thomas Paine, officer of Alford (Lincolnshire), Grantham collection,
   having on July 11th stamped the whole ride, as appears by the specimens
   not being signed in any part thereof, though proper entry was shown in
   journal, and the victualler's stocks drawn down in his books as if the
   same had been surveyed that day, as by William Swallow, Supervisor's
   letter of 3rd instant, and the collector's report thereon, also by the
   said Paine's own confession of the 13th instant, ordered to be discharged;
   that Robert Peat, dropped malt assistant in Lynn collection, succeed him.

   The following is Paine's petition for restoration: 

   "LONDON, July 3, 1766.

   Honourable Sirs,

   In humble obedience to your honours' letter of discharge hearing date
   August 29, 1765, I delivered up my commission and since that time have
   given you no trouble. I confess the (p.18) justice of your honours'
   displeasure and humbly beg to add my thanks for the candour and lenity
   with which you at that unfortunate time indulged me. And though the nature
   of the report and my own confession cut off all expectations of enjoying
   your honours' favour then, yet I humbly hope it has not finally excluded
   me therefrom, upon which hope I humbly presume to entreat your honours to
   restore me.   The time I enjoyed my former commission was short and
   unfortunate -- an officer only a single year. No complaint of the least
   dishonesty or intemperance ever appeared against me; and, if I am so happy
   as to succeed in this, my humble petition, I will endeavour that my future
   conduct shall as much engage your honours' approbation as my former has
   merited your displeasure.

   I am, your honours' most dutiful humble servant, 
   THOMAS PAINE."

   Board's minute: "July 4, 1766. Ordered that he be restored on a proper
   vacancy."

   Mr. B. F. Dun, for thirty-three years an officer of excise, discovered the
   facts connected with Paine 's discharge, and also saw Paine's letter and
   entry books. In a letter before me he says: "I consider Mr. Paine's
   restoration as creditable to him as to the then Board of Excise."

   3.     The document was revived as a pamphlet, though its subject was no
   longer of interest, at a time when Paine's political writings were under
   prosecution, and to afford a vehicle for an "introduction," which gives a
   graphic account of Paine's services in the United States. On a copy of
   this London edition (1793) before me, one of a number of Paine's early
   pamphlets bearing marks of his contemporary English editor, is written
   with pencil: "With a preface (Qy. J. Barlow )." From this, and some
   characteristics of the composition, I have no doubt that the vigorous
   introduction was Barlow's. The production is entitled, "The Case of the
   Officers of Excise; with remarks on the qualifications of Officers; and of
   the numerous evils arising to the Revenue, from the insufficiency of the
   present salary. Humbly addressed to the Hon. and Right Hon. Members of
   both Houses of parliament."

   4.     Goldsmith responded to Paine's desire for his acquaintance. I think
   Paine may be identified as the friend to whom Goldsmith, shortly before
   his (p.299) death, gave the epitaph first printed in Paine's Pennsylvania
   Magazine, January, 1775, beginning:

   "Here Whitefoord reclines, and deny it who can, 
    Though he merrily lived he is now a grave man."

   5.     I am indebted for these records to the Secretary of Inland Revenue,
   England, and to my friend, Charles Macrae, who obtained them for me.

   6.     "THETFORD, NORFOLK, 27th July, 1774.

   "Dear Daughter,

   "I must beg leave to trouble you with my inquiries concerning my unhappy
   son and your husband: various are the reports, which I find come
   originally from the Excise-office. Such as his vile treatment to you, his
   secreting upwards of 30-L- intrusted with him to manage the petition for
   advance of salary; and that since his discharge, he have petitioned to be
   restored, which was rejected with scorn. Since which I am told he have
   left England. To all which I beg you'll be kind enough to answer me by due
   course of post. -- You'll not be a little surprised at my so strongly
   desiring to know what's become of him after I repeat to you his undutiful
   behavior to the tenderest of parents; he never asked of us anything, but
   what was granted, that were in our poor abilities to do; nay, even
   distressed ourselves, whose works are given over by old age, to let him
   have 20-L- on bond, and every other tender mark a parent could possibly
   shew a child; his ingratitude, or rather want of duty, has been such, that
   he have not wrote to me upwards of two years. -- If the above account be
   true, I am heartily sorry, that a woman whose character and amiableness
   deserves the greatest respect, love, and esteem, as I have always on
   enquiry been informed yours did, should betied for life to the worst of
   husbands.

   "I am, dear daughter, your affectionate mother, 

   "F. PAIN.

   "P. S. For God's sake, let me have your answer, as I am almost
   distracted."

   7.     When Paine had the money he did forward twenty pounds to his
   parents, and made provision for his mother when she was a widow. As to
   writing to her, in those unhappy years, he probably thought it better to
   keep his burdens to himself. He may also have been aware of his mothers
   severity without knowing her interest in him.

   8.     "The Early History of Charles James Fox," 1880.

   9.     Mr. W. H. Burr maintains that Paine wrote in the English Crisis
   (1775) under the name of "Casca." As Casca's articles bear intrinsic
   evidence of being written in London -- such as his treating as facts
   General Gage's fictions about Lexington -- the theory supposes Paine to
   have visited England in that year. But besides the facts that Rush had an
   interview with Paine near the middle of March, and Franklin in October,
   the accounts of Aitkin, preserved in Philadelphia, show payments to Paine
   in May, July, and August, 1775. As Mr. Burr's further theory, that Paine
   wrote the letters of Junius, rests largely on the identification with
   "Casca," it might be left to fall with disproof of the latter. It is but
   fair, however, to the labors of a courageous writer, and to the many
   worthy people who have adopted his views, to point out the impossibilities
   of their case. An able (p.50) summary of the facts discoverable concerning
   the personality of Junius, in Macaulay's "Warren Hastings," says: "As to
   the position, pursuits, and connexions of Junius, the following are the
   most important facts which can be considered as clearly proved: first,
   that he was acquainted with the technical forms of the Secretary of
   State's office; secondly, that he was intimately acquainted with the
   business of the war Office; thirdly, that he, during the year 1770,
   attended debates in the House of Lords, and took notes of speeches,
   particularly of the speeches of Lord Chatham; fourthly, that he bitterly
   resented the appointment of Mr. Chamier to the place of Deputy Secretary
   of War; fifthly, that lie was bound by some strong tie to the first Lord
   Holland."

   Now during the period of Junius' letters (Jan. 21, 1769 to Jan. 21, 1772)
   Paine was occupied with his laborious duties as exciseman at Lewes, and
   with the tobacco mill from which he vainly tried to extort a living for
   himself and wife, and her mother. Before that period there was no time at
   which Paine could have commanded the leisure or opportunities necessary to
   master the political and official details known to Junius, even had he
   been interested in them. He declares that he had no interest in politics,
   which he regarded as a species of "jockeyship." How any one can read a
   page of Junius and then one of Paine, and suppose them from the same pen
   appears to me inconceivable. Junius is wrapped up in the affairs of Lord
   This and Duke That, and a hundred details. I can as easily imagine Paine
   agitated with the movements of a battle of chessmen. But apart from this,
   the reader need only refer to the facts of his life before coming to
   America to acquit him of untruth in saying that he lead published nothing
   in England, and that the cause of America made him an author.

   10.  It will be seen by the "Life of William Lloyd Garrison," i., p. 219,
   and iii., p. 145, that Mr. Garrison did not know of Paine's motto ("Rights
   of Man," i., chap. v.). His review of Paine's works appeared November 21,
   1845, The Liberator first appeared January 1, 1831.

   11.  The London Chronicle, of October 25, 1774, printed Major Cartwright's
   "American Independence the Interest and Glory of Great Britain," and it
   was reprinted in the Pennsylvania Journal. Although it has little relation
   to the form in which the question presently suggested itself, the article
   is interesting as an indication that separation was then more talked of in
   England than in America. Twelve years before the Revolution a pamphlet in
   favor of separation was written by Josiah Tucker of Bristol, England. Then
   as now colonists were more loyal than the English at home.

   14.  These resolutions further organized a provisional government to be in
   force until "the legislative body of Great Britain resign its unjust and
   arbitrary pretensions with respect to America." In 1819 a number of
   witnesses stated that so early as May 10th Mecklenburg passed an absolute
   Declaration of Independence, and it is possible that, on receipt of the
   tidings from Lexington, some popular meeting at Charlottetown gave vent to
   its indignation in expressions, or even resolutions, which were tempered
   by the County Committee eleven days later. The resolutions embodying the
   supposititious "Declaration," written out (1800) from memory by the
   alleged secretary of the meeting (Dr. Joseph McKnitt Alexander), are
   believed by Dr. Welling to be "an honest effort to reproduce, according to
   the best of his recollection, the facts and declarations contained in the
   genuine manuscripts of May 31, after that manifesto had been forgotten."
   (North American Review, April, 1874.)   But the testimony is very strong
   in favor of two sets of resolutions.

   15.  Mr. Moreau mentions it as Paine's in his MS. notes in a copy of
   Cheetham's book, now owned by the Pennsylvania Historical Society. No one
   familiar with Paine's style at the time can doubt its authorship.

   New York and Maryland on their delegates. Wisner, the only New York

   recess. In Trumbull's picture at the Capitol Thomas Stone, a signer for
   Maryland, is left out, and Robert Livingston of New York is included,
   though he did not sign it.

   heretical Barlow could find no place for Paine in his Columbiad (1807).

   24.  R. H. Lee, in a letter to his brother (July 5, 1778) says: "We had a
   magnificent celebration of the anniversary of independence. The Whigs of
   the city dressed up a woman of the town with the monstrous head-dress of
   the Tory ladies, and escorted her through the town with a great concourse
   of people. Her head was elegantly and expensively dressed, I suppose about
   three feet high and proportionate width, with a profusion of curls, etc.
   The figure was droll, and occasioned much mirth. It has lessened some
   heads already, and will probably bring the rest within the bounds of
   reason, for they are monstrous indeed. The Tory wife of Dr. Smith has
   christened this figure Continella, or the Duchess of Independence, and
   prayed for a pin from her head by way of relic. The Tory women are very
   much mortified, notwithstanding this." -- "Omitted Chapters of
   History," p.40.

   25.  "Cato's" brilliant wife had to retire before "Continella" in the
   following year. The charter of the College of Philadelphia was taken away,
   and its president retired to an obscure living at Chestertown, Maryland.
   He had, however, some of the dexterity of the Vicar of Bray; when the
   cause he had reviled was nearly won he founded a "Washington" college in
   Maryland. He was chosen by that diocese for a bishop (1783), but the
   General Convention refused to recommend him for consecration. In 1789 he
   managed to regain his place as college president in Philadelphia.

   26.  A theft of Paine's usual signature led to his first public
   identification of himself (Feb. 13, 1779). "As my signature, `Common
   Sense,' has been counterfeited, either by Mr. [Silas] Deane, or some of
   his adherents in Mr. Bradford's paper of Feb. 3, I shall subscribe this
   with my name, Thomas Paine." He, however, in Almon's Remembrancer (vol.
   viii.) is indexed by name in connection with a letter of the previous year
   signed "Common Sense.

   27.  Paine was not then aware of the extent of the intrigues of leading
   Quakers with the enemy. The State archives of England and France contain
   remarkable evidences on this subject. Paul Wentworth, in a report to the
   English government (1776 or 1777) mentions the loyalty of Pemberton and
   the Quakers. Wentworth says that since the publication of "Common
   Sense" it had become hard to discover the real opinions of leading men.
   "Mr. Payne," he says, "should not be forgot. He is an Englishman, was
   schoolmaster in Philadelphia; must be driven to work; naturally indolent;
   led by His passions." These "passions," chiefly for liberty and humanity,
   seem to have so driven the indolent man to work that, according to
   Wentworth, his pamphlet "worked up [the people] to such a high temper as
   fitted them for the impression of the Declaration, etc." The Quakers,
   however, held out long, though more covertly, M. Gerard de Rayneval, in a
   letter from Philadelphia, Sept. 18, 1778, reports to his government:
   "During the occupation of Philadelphia by the English, proofs were
   obtained of the services rendered them by the Quakers; some of these were
   caught acting as spies, etc." La Luzerne writes (May 4, 1781): "All the
   Quakers in Philadelphia who have taken up arms, or voluntarily paid war
   taxes, have been excommunicated; these, increasing in number, declare
   themselves loyal." See for further information on this matter, "New
   Materials for the History of the American Revolution," etc., by John
   Durand. New York, 1889.

   28.  Colonel Gadsden, having left the Continental Congress to take command
   in South Carolina, appeared in the provincial Congress at Charleston
   February 10, 1776. "Col. Gadsden (having brought the first copy of Paine's
   pamphlet 'Common Sense,' etc.,) boldly declared himself . . . for the
   absolute Independence of America. This last sentiment came like an
   explosion of thunder on the members " (Rev. John Drayton's Memoirs, etc.,
   p, 172). The sentiment was abhorred, and a member "called the author
   of'Common Sense' "; but on March 21st the pamphlet was reinforced by
   tidings of an Act of Parliament (Dec. 21, 1775) for seizure of American
   ships, and on March 23d South Carolina instructed its delegates at
   Philadelphia to agree to whatever that Congress should "judge necessary,
   etc."

   29.  A thousand copies of "Common Sense" were at once ordered from
   Virginia, and many more followed. On April 1st Washington writes to Joseph
   Reed: "By private letters which I have lately received from Virginia, I
   find 'Common Sense' is working a wonderful change there in the minds of
   many men." On June 29th union with England was "totally dissolved" by
   Virginia.

   30.  Professor John Fiske (whose "American Revolution" suffers from
   ignorance of Paine's papers) appreciates the effect of Paine's "Common
   Sense" but not its cause. He praises the pamphlet highly, but proves that
   he has only glanced at it by his exception: "The pamphlet is full of
   scurrilous abuse of the English people; and resorts to such stupid
   arguments as the denial of the English origin of the Americans" (i,
   p.174). Starting with the principle that the cause of America is "the
   cause of all mankind," Paine abuses no people, but only their oppressors.
   As to Paine's argument, it might have appeared less "stupid" to Professor
   Fiske had he realized that in Paine's mind negroes were the equals of
   whites. However, Paine does not particularly mention negroes; his argument
   was meant to carry its point, and it might have been imprudent for him, in
   that connection, to have classed the slaves with the Germans, who formed a
   majority in Pennsylvania, and with the Dutch of New York. In replying to
   the "Mother-Country" argument it appears to me far from stupid to point
   out that Europe is our parent country, and that if English descent made
   men Englishmen, the descendants of William the Conqueror and half the
   peers of England were Frenchmen, and, if the logic held, should be
   governed by France.

   31.  See Almon's Remembrancer, 1777, p.28, for Paine's graphic journal of
   this retreat, quoted from the Pennsylvania Journal . In reply to those who
   censured the retreat as pusillanimous, he states that "our army was at one
   time less than a thousand effective men and never more than 4,000," the
   pursuers being "8,000 exclusive of their artillery and light horse"; he
   declares that posterity will call the retreat "glorious -- and the names
   of Washington and Fabius will run paralell to eternity." In
   the Pennsylvania Packet (March 20, 1779) Paine says: "I had begun the
   first number of the Crisis while on the retreat, at Newark, with a design
   of publishing it in the Jersies, as it was General Washington's intention
   to have made a stand at Newark, could he have been timely reenforced;
   instead of which nearly half the army left him at that place, or soon
   after, their time being out."

   32.  The pamphlet was dated December 23rd, but it had appeared on the 19th
   in the Pennsylvania Journal.

   33.  Paine's enemy, Cheetham, durst not, in the face of Washington's
   expression of his "lively sense of the importance of your [Paine's]
   works," challenge well known facts, and must needs partly confess them:
   "The number was read in the camp, to every corporal's guard, and in the
   army and out of it had more than the intended effect. The convention of
   New York, reduced by dispersion, occasioned by alarm, to nine members, was
   rallied and reanimated. Militiamen who, already tired of the war, were
   straggling from the army, returned. Hope succeeded to despair,
   cheerfulness to gloom, and firmness to irresolution. To the confidence
   which it inspired may be attributed much of the brilliant little affair
   which in the same month followed at Trenton." Even Oldys is somewhat
   impressed by Paine's courage: "The Congress fled. All were dismayed. Not
   so our author."

   bears the superscription: "Honbl. Richd. Henry Lee Esq. (in Congress) York
   Town. Forwarded by yr humble Servt. T. Matlack, Nov. 1, 1777." Endorsed in
   handwriting of Lee: "Oct: 1777. Mr. Paine, Author of `Common Sense.'"

   38.  Professor Fiske ("Am. Revolution," i., p. 341) has a ferocious attack
   on Congress for breaking faith in this matter, but no doubt he has by this
   time read, in Ford's "Writings of Washington," (vol. vi.) the letters
   which bring his attack on the great commander's own haloed head.

   39.  See his letter to the President of Congress. Ford's "Writings of
   Washington," vol. vi., p. 82.

   40.  This I learn by a note from Mr. Henry's descendant, John W. Jordan.
   At this time Paine laid before Henry his scheme for steam-navigation.

   41.  The house is marked "B. by J. B. Cookis in the year 1761." It is
   probable that Congress deemed it prudent to keep important documents a
   little way from the edifice in the centre of the town where it met, a
   building which no longer stands.

   42.  I am indebted to Mr, Simon Gratz, of Philadelphia, for this and
   several other letters of Paine to Laurens.

   43.  The arrival of the Commissioners caused Paine to address his Crisis
   VI to them instead of to Lord North, as he tells Franklin is his
   intention. The above letter was no doubt written in the old stone house at
   York.

   45.  M. Doniol and Mr. Durand are entirely mistaken in supposing that Lee
   was "substantially a traitor." That he wrote to Lord Shelburne that "if
   England wanted to prevent closer ties between France and the United States
   she must not delay," proves indeed the reverse. He wanted recognition of
   the independence of his country, and peace, and was as willing to get it
   from England as from France. He was no doubt well aware that French
   subsidies were meant, as Beaumarchais reminded the King, to continue the
   war in America, not to end it. Arthur Lee had his faults, but lack of
   patriotism was not among them.

   46.  Error. Paine signed "Common Sense," and in one instance "Thomas
   Paine."

   47.  Paine resigned. Several motions for his dismissal were lost.

   48.  Gouverneur Morris himself.

   49.  This was the receipt dated June 10, 1776, on which the King had
   marked "Bon," and was obtained by Morris in 1794.

   50.  The documents referred to are no doubt among the Lee Papers preserved
   at the University of Virginia, which I have examined.

   51.  In one of Deane's intercepted letters (May 20, 1781) there is an
   indication that he had found more truth in what Paine had said about the
   gratuitous supplies than Beaumarchais had led him to believe. "The first
   plan of the French government evidently was to assist us just so far as
   might be absolutely necessary to prevent an accommodation, and to give
   this assistance with so much secresy as to avoid any rupture with Great
   Britain. On this plan succors were first permitted to be sent out to us by
   private individuals, and only on condition of future payment, but
   afterward we were thought to be such cheap and effectual instruments of
   mischief to the British nation that more direct and gratuitous aids were
   furnished us." But now M. Doniol has brought to light
   theReflexions and Considerations of the French Minister, Count de
   Vergennes, which led to his employment of Beaumarchais, which contain such
   propositions as these: "It is essential that France shall at present
   direct its care towards this end; she must nourish the courage and
   perseverance of the insurgents by flattering their hope of effectual
   assistance when circumstances permit." "It will be expedient to give the
   insurgents secret aid in munitions and money; utility suggests this small
   sacrifice." "Should France and Spain give succors, they should seek
   compensation only in the political object they have at heart, reserving to
   themselves subsequent decision, after the events and according to the
   situations." "It would be neither for the king's dignity or interest to
   bargain with the insurgents." It is certain that Beaumarchais was required
   to impress these sentiments on Arthur Lee, who continued to take them
   seriously, and made Paine take them so, after Beaumarchais was taking only
   his own interests seriously.

   52.  I am indebted to Mr. Simon Gratz of Philadelphia for a copy of this
   letter.

   53.  "Life and Correspondence of Joseph Reed." By his grandson. 1847.

   54.  Paine forgot the curious inconsistency in this constitution of 1776,
   between the opening Declaration of Rights in securing religious freedom
   and equality to all who "acknowledge the being of a God," and the oath
   provided for all legislators, requiring belief in future rewards and
   punishments, and in the divine inspiration of the Old and New Testaments.
   This deistical oath, however, was probably considered a victory of
   latitudiarianism, for the members of the convention had taken a rigid
   trinitarian oath on admission to their seats.

   55.  See "A Memoir of the Rev. William Smith, D.D.," by Charles J, Stille,
   Philadelphia, 1869. Provost Stille, in this useful historical pamphlet,
   states all that can be said in favor of Dr. Smith, but does not refer to
   his controversy with Paine,

   56.  This incident is related in the interest of religion in Mr.
   Henry's "Account of Arnold's Campaign against Quebec." The book repeats
   the old charge of drunkenness against Paine, but the untrustworthiness of
   the writer's memory is shown in his saying that his father grieved when
   Paine's true character appeared, evidently meaning his "infidelity." His
   father died in 1786, when no suspicion either of Paine's habits or
   orthodoxy had been heard.

   59.  The salary was drawn on June 7th, and amounted to $1,699. For
   particulars concerning Paine's connection with the Assembly I am indebted
   to Dr. William H. Egle, State Librarian of Pennsylvania.

   60.  Mr. Burk, Secretary of the University of Pennsylvania, sends me some
   interesting particulars. The proposal to confer the degree on Paine was
   unanimously agreed to by the trustees present, who were the Hon. Joseph
   Reed, President of the Province; Mr. Moore, Vice-President; Mr. Sproat
   (Presbyterian minister), Mr. White (the Bishop), Mr. Helmuth, Mr. Weiborg
   (minister of the German Calvinist Church), Mr. Farmer (Roman Catholic
   Rector of St. Mary's), Dr. Bond, Dr. Hutchkinson, Mr. Muhlenberg (Lutheran
   minister). There were seven other recipients of the honor on that day, all
   eminent ministers of religion; and M.D. was conferred on David Ramsay, a
   prisoner with the enemy.

   61.  "In Council, Philadelphia, October 10th, 1780. "SIR,

   "Pay to Thomas Paine Esquire, or his order, the amount of three hundred
   and sixty dollars Continental money in State money, at sixty to one,
   amount of his account for 10 dozen of the Crisis Extraordinary. WM.

   63.  Of course this issue of State v. National sovereignty was adjourned
   to the future battle-field, where indeed it was not settled. Congress
   accepted Virginia's concession of the territory in question (March 1,
   1784), without conceding that it was a donation; it accepted some of
   Virginia's conditions, but refused others, which the State surrendered. A
   motion that this acceptance did not imply endorsement of Virginia's claim
   was lost, but the contrary was not affirmed. The issue was therefore
   settled only in Paine's pamphlet, which remains a document of paramount
   historical interest.

   There was, of course, a rumor that Paine's pamphlet was a piece of paid
   advocacy. I remarked among the Lee MSS., at the University of Virginia, an
   unsigned scrap of paper saying he had been promised twelve thousand acres
   of western land. Such a promise could only have been made by the old
   Indiana, or Vandalia Company, which was trying to revive its defeated
   claim for lands conveyed by the Indians in compensation for property they
   had destroyed. Their agent, Samuel Wharton, may have employed Paine's pen
   for some kind of work. But there is no faintest trace of advocacy in
   Paine's "Public Good." He simply maintains that the territories belong to
   the United States, and should be sold to pay the public debt, -- a
   principle as fatal to the claim of a Company as to that of a State.

   64.  Dr. Egle informs me that the following payments to Paine appear in
   the Treasurer's account: 1779, November 27, -L-450. 1780, February 14. For
   public service at a treaty held at Easton in 1777, -L-300. February 14.
   Pay as clerk, -L-582. 10. 0. March 18. On account as clerk, -L-187. 10. 0.
   March 27, "for his services" (probably those mentioned on p. 94),
   -L-2,355. 7. 6. June 7, "for 60 days attendance and extra expenses,"
   -L-1,699. 1. 6. (This was all paper money, and of much less value than it
   seems. The last payment was drawn on the occasion of his subscription of
   the $500, apparently hard money, in response to Washington's appeal.)   In
   March, 1780, a Fee Act was passed regulating the payment of officers of
   the State in accordance with the price of wheat; but this was ineffectual
   to preserve the State paper from depreciation. In June, 1780, a list of
   lawyers and State officers willing to take paper money of the March issue
   as gold and silver was published, and in it appears "Thomas Paine, clerk
   to the General Assembly."

   65.  He confides to Franklin a letter to be forwarded to Bury St. Edmunds,
   the region of his birth. Perhaps he had already been corresponding with
   someone there about his projected visit. Ten years later the Bury
   Post vigorously supported Paine and his"Rights of Man."

   70.  Historians have evaded this ugly business. I am indebted to the
   family of General Lincoln, then Secretary of War, for the following letter
   addressed to him by Washington, June 5, 1782: "Col. Hazen's sending me an
   officer under the capitulation of Yorktown for the purpose of retaliation
   has distressed me exceedingly. Be so good as to give me your opinion of
   the propriety of doing this upon Captain Asgill, if we should be driven to
   it for want of an unconditional prisoner. Presuming that this matter has
   been a subject of much conversation, pray with your own let me know the
   opinions of the most sensible of those with whom you have conversed.
   Congress by their resolve has unanimously approved of my determination to
   retaliate. The army have advised it, and the country look for it. But how
   far is it justifiable upon an officer under the faith of a capitulation,
   if none other can be had is the question?   Hazen's sending Captain Asgill
   on for this purpose makes the matter more distressing, as the whole
   business will have the appearance of a farce, if some person is not
   sacrificed to the mains of poor Huddy; which will be the case if an
   unconditional prisoner cannot be found, and Asgill escapes. I write you in
   exceeding great haste; but beg your sentiments may be transmitted as soon
   as possible (by express), as I may be forced to a decision in the course
   of a few days."I am most sincerely and affectionately, D'r Sir, yr.
   obed't,  "G. WASHINGTON."

   71.  Here Paine is more acute than exact. On June 3, 1778, the English
   Commissioners sent Congress the resolutions for negotiation adopted by
   Parliament, February 17th. Congress answered that on April 22d it had
   published its sentiments on these acts. But these sentiments had admitted
   a willingness to negotiate if Great Britain should "as a preliminary
   thereto, either withdraw their fleets and armies, or else, in positive and
   express terms, acknowledge he independence of the said States." But in
   referring the commissioners (June 6th) to its manifesto of April 22d, the
   Congress essentially modified the conditions: it would treat only as an
   independent nation, and with "sacred regard" to its treaties. On June 17th
   Congress returned the English Commissioners their proposal (sent on the
   9th) unconsidered, because of its insults to their ally.

   72.  It may be traced through the Providence Gazette of December 21, 28
   (1782), January 4, 11, 18, 25, February 1 (1783); also in the Newport
   Mercury. Paine writes under the signature of "A Friend to Rhode Island and
   the Union." I am indebted to Professor Jamieson of Brown University for
   assistance in this investigation.

   73.  This had been Washington's suggestion.

   74.  See Paine's essay on "The Cause of the Yellow Fever.";  These
   experiments on the river at Rocky Hill were followed by others in
   Philadelphia, with Rittenhouse.

   75.  The indenture, made June 16, 1784, is in the Register's Office of
   Westchester County, Vol. T. of Grantees, p. 163. The confiscated estate of
   the loyalist Devoe is the well-known one at New Rochelle on which Paine's
   monument stands. I am indebted for investigations at White Plains, and
   documents relating to the estate, to my friend George Hoadly, and Mr. B.
   Davis Washburn.

   76.  Paine wrote four patriotic American songs: "Hail, Great Republic of
   the World" (tune "Rule Britannia"); "To Columbia, who Gladly Reclined at
   her Ease"; "Ye Sous of Columbia, who Bravely have Fought," -- both of the
   latter being for the tune of "Anacreon in Hell"; and "Liberty Tree" (tune
   "Gods of the Greeks"), beginning, "In a chariot of light, from the regions
   of Day," etc.

   77.  "An old lady, now a boarding-housekeeper in Cedar Street, remembers
   when a girl visiting Mr. Paine when he tools possession of his house and
   farm at New Rochelle, and gave a village fete on the occasion; she then
   only knew him as `Common Sense,' and supposed that was his name. On that
   day he had something to say to everybody, and young as she was she
   received a portion of his attention; while he sat in the shade, and
   assisted in the labor of the feast, by cutting or breaking sugar to be
   used in some agreeable liquids by his guests,   Mr. Paine was then, if not
   handsome, a fine agreeable looking man." -- Vale, 1841 . The original
   house was accidentally destroyed by fire, while Paine was in the French
   Convention. The present house was, however, occupied by him after his
   return to America.

   78.  I found this letter (to Lee) among the Franklin MSS, in the
   Philosophical Society, Philadelphia.

   79.  I am indebted for this letter to Mr. Frederick McGuire, of
   Washington.

   80.  Arthur Lee was most responsible for the failure of the measure, for
   he was active in cultivating a prejudice against Paine. This was somewhat
   ungracious, as Paine had befriended Lee in his controversy with Deane."
   Ford's "Writings of Washington,"x., p.395. Had there been any belief at
   this time that Paine had been paid for writing the pamphlet objected
   to, "Public Good," it would no doubt have been mentioned.

   81.  "Commodore Nicholson was an active republican politician in the city
   of New York, and his house was a headquarters for the men of his way of
   thinking. The young ladies' letters are full of allusions to the New York
   society of that day, and to calls from Aaron Burr, the Livingstons, the
   Clintons, and many others, . . . An other man still more famous in some
   respects was a frequent visitor at their house. It is now almost forgotten
   that Thomas Paine, down to the time of his departure for Europe in 1787,
   was a fashionable member of society, admired and courted as the greatest
   literary genius of his day . . . . Here is a little autograph, found among
   the papers of Mrs. Gallatin [nee Nicholson]; its address is to: `Miss
   Hannah N., at the Lord knows where, -- You Mistress Hannah if you don't
   come home, I'll come and fetch you.'

   T. PAINE."

   -- Adams' "Life of Gallatin."

   82.  The remainder of the letter (MS. Philosoph. Soc., Philadelphia) seems
   to be in the writing of William Temple Franklin, to whom probably Paine
   had enclosed a note: 

   "Mr. Williams whom you inquire after accompanied us to America, and is now
   here. We left Mrs. Wms. and her sisters well at St. Ger's, but they
   proposed shortly returning to England to live with their uncle, Mr. J.
   Alexander, who has entirely settled his affairs with Mr. Walpole and the
   Bank. Mr, Wm. Alex'r I suppose you know is in Virginia fulfilling his
   tobacco contract with the Farmer Gen'l. The Marquis la Fayette we saw a
   few days before we left Passy -- he was well and on the point of setting
   off on an excursion into Germany, and a visit to the Emperor K. of
   Prussia. -- I purpose shortly being at New York, where I will with
   pleasure give you any further information you may wish, and shall be very
   happy to cultivate the acquaintance and friendship of Mr. Paine, for whose
   character I have a sincere regard and of whose services I, as an American,
   have a grateful sense."

   Revolution, being the author of 'Common Sense,' a pamphlet that had
   prodigious effects." -- Franklin to M. de Veillard.

   91.  For this letter I am indebted to Mr. Curtis Guild, of Boston. The
   letter goes on to describe, with drawings, the famous bridge at
   Schaffhausen, built by Grubenmann, an uneducated carpenter, the model
   being shown Paine by the King's architect, Perronet. The Academy's
   committee presently made its report, which was even more favorable than
   Paine had anticipated.

   92.  "Danton Emigre," p.7. Paine wrote a brief archaeological treatise on
   freemasonry, but I have not met with the statement that he was a freemason
   except in Dr. Robinet's volume, -- certainly high authority.

   93.  The exact time of his arrival in England is doubtful. Oldys says: "He
   arrived at the White Bear, Picadilly, on the 3d of September, 1787, just
   thirteen years after his departure for Philadelphia." Writing in 1803
   Paine also says it was in September. But his"Rubicon" pamphlet is dated
   "York Street, St, James's Square, 10th August, 1787." Possibly the
   manuscript was dated in Paris and forwarded to the London printer with the
   address at which he wished to find proof on his arrival.

   title; "Prospects on the War, and Paper Currency. The second edition,
   corrected." Advertisement (June 10th); "This pamphlet was written by Mr.
   Paine in the year 1787, on one of Mr. Pitt's armaments, namely, that
   against Holland. His object was to prevent the people of England from
   being seduced into a war, by stating clearly to them the consequences
   which would inevitably befall the credit of this country should such a
   calamity take place. The minister has at length, however, succeeded in his
   great project, after three expensive armaments within the space of seven
   years; and the event has proved how well founded were the predictions of
   Mr. Paine. The person who has authority to bring forward this pamphlet in
   its present shape, thinks his doing so a duty which he owes both to Mr. P.
   and the people of England, in order that the latter may judge what credit
   is due to (what a great judge calls) THE WILD THEORIES OF MR. PAINE,"

   Museum, Washington, are of the fashionable kind.)

   99.  I am reluctantly compelled to give only the main ideas of several
   theses of this kind by Paine, found among Jefferson's papers. The portion
   of the "Jefferson Papers" at Washington written by Paine would fill a good
   volume.

   dated August 28, 1788, declares his invention to be "on principles new and
   different to anything hitherto practised." The patents for England,
   Scotland, and Ireland were granted in September. An iron arch of one
   hundred feet was designed by Pritchard and erected by Darby at Coalbrook
   Dale, Shropshire, in 1779, but it did not anticipate the invention of
   Paine, as may be seen by the article on "Iron Bridges" in
   the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which also well remarks that Paine's "daring
   in engineering does full justice to the fervour of his political career."
   (Eighth edition; it is omitted in the ninth.)

   101.                   It is droll to find even Paine's iron bridge
   resting somewhat on a "paper" pier. "Perhaps," he writes Jefferson, "the
   excess of paper currency, and the wish to find objects for realizing it,
   is one of the motives for promoting the plan of the Bridge."

   102.                   I recently obtained from a solicitor of Rotherham,
   Mr. Rising, a letter (on whose large seal part of the P remains), written
   by Paine from London to Thomas Walker, Esq., a member of the firm which
   manufactured the large model of the iron bridge invented by the author,
   and exhibited at Paddington in June, 1790. The letter is dated February
   26, 1789, and the first part, which relates to the bridge, is quoted in
   Appendix E. The political part, here given, relates to the controversy
   which arose on the insanity of the Prince of Wales by hereditary right,
   while the Pitt Ministry maintained that the Prince had no right during the
   King's lifetime, more than any other person, though it was "expedient" to
   select him as the Regent, with restrictions on his power imposed by the
   two Houses of Parliament. Paine writes: 

   "With respect to News and Politics, the King is certainly greatly amended,
   but what is to follow from it is a matter of much certainty. How far the
   Nation may be safe with a man of a deranged mind at the head of it, and
   who, ever since he took up the notion of quitting England and going to
   live in Hanover, has been continually planning to entangle England with
   German connections, which if followed must end in a war, is a matter that
   will occasion various opinions. However unfortunate it may have been for
   the sufferer, the King's malady has been no disservice to the Nation; he
   was burning his fingers very fast in the German war, and whether he is
   enough in his senses to keep out of the fire is a matter of doubt.

   "You mention the Rotherham Address as complimenting Mr. Pitt on the
   success of his administration, and for asserting and supporting the Rights
   of the People. I differ exceedingly from you in this opinion, and I think
   the conduct of the Opposition much nearer to the principles of the
   Constitution, than what the conduct of the Ministry was. So far from Mr.
   Pitt asserting and supporting the Rights of the people, it appears to me
   taking them away -- but as a man ought not to make an assertion without
   giving his reasons, I will give you mine.

   "The English Nation is composed of two orders of men -- Peers and
   Commoners. By Commoners is properly meant every man in the Nation not
   having the title of Peer. And it is the existence of those two orders,
   setting up distinct and opposite Claims, the one hereditary and the other
   elective, that makes it necessary to establish a third order, or that
   known by the name of the Regal Power, or the Power of the Crown.

   "The Regal Power is the Majesty of the Nation collected to a center, and
   residing in the person exercising the Regal Power. The Right therefore of
   the Prince is a Right standing on the Right of the whole Nation. But Mr.
   Pitt says it stands on the Right of Parliament. Is not Parliament composed
   of two houses, one of which is itself hereditary, and over which the
   people have no control, and in the establishment of which they have no
   election; and the other house the representative of only a small part of
   the nation? How then can the Rights of the People be asserted and
   supported by absorbing them into an hereditary house of Peers? Is not one
   hereditary power or Right as dangerous as the other? And yet the
   Addressers have all gone on the Error of establishing Power in the house
   of Peers, over whom, as I have already said, they have no control, for the
   inconsistent purpose of opposing it in the prince over whom they have some
   control.

   "It was one of those Cases in which there ought to have been a National
   Convention for the express purpose: for if Government be permitted to
   alter itself, or any of the parts be permitted to alter the other, there
   is no fixed Constitution in the Country. And if the Regal Power, or the
   person exercising the Regal Power, either as King or Regent, instead of
   standing on the universal ground of the Nation, be made the mere Creature
   of Parliament, it is, in my humble opinion, equally as inconsistent and
   unconstitutional as if Parliament was the mere Creature of the Crown.

   "It is a common Idea in all countries that to take Power from the Prince
   is to give liberty to the people. But Mr. Pitt's conduct is almost the
   reverse of this: his is to take power from one part of the Government to
   add it to another; for he has increased the Power of the Peers, not the
   Rights of the People. -- I must give him credit for his ingenuity if I do
   not for his principles, and the less so because the object of his conduct
   is now visible, which was to [keep] themselves in pay after they should be
   out of f[avor], by retaining, thro' an Act of Parliament of their own
   making, between four and five hundred thousand pounds of the Civil List in
   their own hands. This is the key of the whole business; and it was for
   this and not for the Rights of the people that he set up the Right of
   Parliament, because it was only by that means that the spoil could be
   divided. If the restrictions had been that he should not declare war, or
   enter into foreign alliances without the consent of Parliament, the
   objects would have been national and would have had some sense in them;
   but it is, that he should not have all the money. If Swift was alive he
   would say -- 'S___ on such Patriotism.'

   "How they will manage with Ireland I have no opportunity of learning, as I
   have not been at the other end of the Town since the Commission arrived.
   Ireland will certainly judge for itself, and not permit the English
   Parliament or Doctors to judge for her. -- Thus much for Politics."

   The letter just quoted is the more remarkable because the Prince Regent
   was particularly odious to Paine. The reader will find this issue of the
   Regency dealt with in the Rights of Man, but it may be remarked in passing
   that this supposed purblind enemy of thrones was found in 1789 maintaining
   that the monarch, however objectionable, was more related to the people
   than a non-representative Parliament, and that in 1793 he pleaded for the
   life of Louis XVI. -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iv,
   Introduction.

   103.                   I have not been able to find anything more of
   Paine's protege James, whose parents were known to him before his
   departure for American. I am indebted to Mr. W. E. Benjamin for the
   letter.

   104.                   To a representative of this family I am indebted
   for the letter.

   105.                   Paine's marriage and separation from his wife had
   been kept a secret in America, where the "Tories" would have used it to
   break the influence of his patriotic writings. It may be stated here, in
   addition to what is said on p. 32, that, in the absence of any divorce law
   in England, a separation under the Common Law was generally held as
   pronouncing the marriage a nullity ab initio. According to Chalmers Paine
   was dissatisfied with articles of separation drawn up by an attorney,
   Josias Smith, May 24, 1774, and insisted on new ones, to which the
   clergyman was a party. The "common lawyers" regarded the marriage as
   completely annulled, and Paine thus free to marry again. However, he
   evidently never thought of doing so, and that his relations with ladies
   were as chaste as affectionate appears in this letter to Mrs. Few, and in
   his correspondence generally.

   106.                   Mazzel was a scientific Italian who settled in
   Virginia with a Tuscan colony before the Revolution, in which he took up
   arms and was captured by the British. His colony had been under the
   patronage of Jefferson, to whose fortunes he was always devoted, though
   the publication of Jefferson's famous letter to him, reflecting on
   Washington's administration, caused his patron much trouble.

   107.                   On this Blue and Buff Society, Canning wrote some

   filtered through the dregs of Paine."

   108.                   This and other parts of Paine's correspondence were

   111.                   One cannot help wondering how, in this matter,
   Paine got along with his friend Jefferson, who, at the very time of his
   enthusiasm for the French Revolution, had a slave in his house at
   Challiot. Paine was not of the philanthropic type portrayed in the "Biglow
   Papers."

   "I do believe in Freedom's cause

   has written a preface.

   114.                   In another letter of Lafayette to Washington (March
   17, 1790) he writes:

   "To Mr. Paine, who leaves for London, I entrust the care of sending you my
   news. . . . Permit me, my dear General, to offer you a picture
   representing the Bastille as it was some days after I gave the order for
   its demolition. I also pay you the homage of sending you the principal Key
   of that fortress of despotism. It is a tribute I owe as a son to my
   adoptive father, as aide-de-camp to my General, as a missionary of liberty
   to his Patriarch." Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii,
   Introduction

   115.                   I have found in the manuscript despatches of Louis
   Otto, Charge d'Affaires, several amusing paragraphs, addressed to his
   government at Paris, about this Key: "August 4, 1790.

   In attending yesterday the public audience of the President, I was
   surprised by a question from the Chief Magistrate, 'whether I would like
   to see the Key of the Bastille?' One of his secretaries showed me at the
   same moment a large Key, which bad been sent to the President by desire of
   the Marquis de la Fayette [Lafayette]. I dissembled my surprise in
   observing to the President that 'the time bad not yet come in America to
   do iron [p.vi] work equal to that before him.' The Americans present
   looked at the key with indifference, and as if wondering why it had been
   sent. But the serene face of the President showed that he regarded it as
   an homage from the French nation." 

   "December 13, 1790.

   "The Key of the Bastille, regularly shown at the President's audiences, is
   now also on exhibition in Mrs. Washington's salon, where it satisfies the
   curiosity of the Philadelphians. I am persuaded, Monseigneur, that it is
   only their vanity that finds pleasure in the exhibition of this trophy,
   but Frenchmen here are not the less piqued, and many will not enter the
   President's house on this account."

   116.                   "Her Paine; rebellious Staymaker; unkempt; who
   feels that he, a single needleman, did, by his `Common Sense' pamphlet,
   free America that he can and will free all this World; perhaps even the
   other." -- French Revolution.

   117.                   IN a letter of Lafayette to Washington ("Paris, 12
   Jan., 1790") he writes: "Common Sense is writing for you a brochure where
   you will see a part of my adventures." It thus appears that the narrative
   embodied in the reply to Burke ("Rights of Man," Part I.), dedicated to
   Washington, was begun with Lafayette's collaboration fourteen months
   before its publication (March 13, 1791). -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas
   Paine, vol. III, Introduction.

   118.                   "I have got it -- If this do not cure my cough it
   is a damned perverse mule of a cough -- The pamphlet -- From the row --
   But mum -- We don't sell it -- Oh, no -- Ears and Eggs -- Verbatim, except
   the addition of a short preface, which as you have not seen, I send you my
   copy -- Not a single castration (Laud be unto God and J. S, Jordan!) can I
   discover -- Hey for the New Jerusalem!   The Millennium!   And peace and
   eternal beatitude be unto the soul of Thomas Paine!" -- C. Kegan
   Paul's "William Godwin." In supposing that Paine may have gone to Paris
   before his book appeared (March 13th), I have followed Rickman, who says
   the work was written "partly at the Angel, at Islington, partly in Harding
   Street, Fetter Lane, and finished at Versailles." He adds that "many
   hundred thousand more copies were rapidly sold." But I have no certain
   trace of Paine in Paris in 1791 earlier than April 8th.

   119.                   This comparison was made for me by a careful
   writer, Mr. J. M. Wheeler, of London, who finds, with a few corrections in
   spelling, but one case of softening: "p 60, in Johnson Paine wrote
   'Everything in the English government appears to me the reverse of what it
   ought to be, which in Jordan is modified to ' Many things,' etc."

   120.                   The tremendous effect produced in Ireland by
   Paine's answer to Burke is indicated in the Charlemont Papers (Hist. MSS.
   Com. 1894). Mr. Thomas Shore first called attention to the items
   concerning Paine in the London Freethinker, March and April, 1896.
   Although Charlemont had been made an earl for quelling an insurrection in
   Ulster, 1763, he was a Liberal Whig. In 1791 (April 11) Sheridan writes
   from Downpatrick to Charlemont:

   121.                   "I find from the newspapers that the Whigs of the
   capital (a society of which I am a member, and into which I entered with
   the best intentions) have, in my absence, and without my knowledge, named
   and published me one of a committee for disseminating Mr. Paine's pamphlet
   in reply to Mr. Burke's Reflections on the French Revolution. I have read
   that pamphlet; it appears to me designed to level all distinction, and to
   have this object in view -- a total overthrow of the Constitution. With
   this opinion I must naturally feel it indecent, in my public situation as
   a member of parliament, a citizen, a barrister and (what I value least)
   one of his majesty's counsel, to disseminate that work, but I am at a loss
   how to act. My first intention was to contradict it publicly. I fear a
   misinterpretation of my motives, and I dislike public differences with men
   in whose cause I am an humble assistant."

   122.                   Two days later Charlemont replies:

   123.                   "Thinking exactly as you do of Paine's very
   entertaining, very ingenious, but very dangerous performance . . . yet how
   to advise upon this occasion I do not well know. A serious public
   contradiction would not be pleasant, and possibly not innoxious. Perhaps
   the best method may be to expostulate between jest and earnest with some
   of your brethren on the liberty they have taken, and to declare in all
   companies, without being too serious, your real opinion of the tendency of
   the pamphlet, giving it, however, its due praise, for much merit it
   certainly has. . . . Men connected with the popular party will often be
   brought into scrapes of this sort, as the people who sometimes do not go
   too far will seldom go far enough."

   124.                   It is evident that Paine had a powerful following,
   and that it was not at that time prudent for a Whig politician to
   repudiate him. Soon after we find Earl Charlemont writing from Dublin, May
   9, 1791, to Dr. Alexander Haliday, Belfast: "I did, indeed, suppose that
   Paine's pamphlet, which is, by the way, a work of great genius, would be
   well received in your district; yet, in my opinion, it ought to be read
   with some degree of caution. He does, indeed, tear away the bandage from
   the public eye; but in tearing it off there may be some danger of injuring
   the organ." In reply to a radical outburst from Haliday, Charlemont writes
   (July 30, 1791): "Though I admire Mr. Paine, I am by no means a convert to
   his doctrine concerning our constitution, and cannot help thinking that
   some approbation of this constitution, as it ought to be, should at all
   times be joined with the applause which we so justly bestow on the
   emancipation of a great people from utter slavery." Charlemont was a
   friend and correspondent of Burke, and frankly expressed his differences
   of opinion, but Holiday gave him proofs of a dishonorable proceeding on
   Burke's part, eleven years before (borrowing a manuscript play of
   Haliday's in confidence, showing it to Sheridan, and never returning it,
   professing that it was lost), and pronounced him (Burke) a snake in the
   grass. Thereafter no communication appears between Charlemont and Burke.
   -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iv, Introduction.

   125.                   "Thirty thousand copies of Burke's book were
   circulated in all the courts and among the European aristocracy as so many
   lighted brands to set Europe in flames. During this time the author, by
   his secret correspondence, excited Queen Marie Antoinette, the court, the
   foreigners, to conspire against the Revolution. 'No compromises with
   rebels!' he wrote; 'appeal to sovereign neighbors; above all trust to the
   support of foreign armies.'   "Histoire de France," par Henri Martin, i.,
   p.151.

   126.                   Dr. Franklin had these constitutions translated,
   and presented them in a finely bound volume to the King. According to
   Paine, who must have heard it from Franklin, Vergennes resisted their
   publication, but was obliged to give way to public demand. Paine could not
   allude to the effect of his own work, "Common Sense," which may have been
   the more effective because its argument against monarchy was omitted from
   the translation. But his enemies did not fail to credit his pen with the
   catastrophes in France. John Adams declares that the Constitution of
   Pennsylvania was ascribed wrongly to Franklin; it was written by Paine and
   three others; Turgot, Condorcet, and the Duke de la Rochefoucauld were
   enamored of it, and two of them "owed their final and fatal catastrophe to
   this blind love" (Letter to S. Perley, June 19, 1809). Whence Cheetham,
   dwelling on the enormity of the "single representative assembly," queries:
   "May not Paine's constitution of Pennsylvania have been the cause of the
   tyranny of Robespierre?"

   127.                   "Sir, I present you a small treatise in defence of
   those principles of freedom which your exemplary virtue hath so eminently
   contributed to establish. That the rights of men may become as universal
   as your benevolence can wish, and that you may enjoy the happiness of
   seeing the new world regenerate the old, is the prayer of, Sir, your much
   obliged, and obedient humble servant, THOMAS  PAINE."

   128.                   It has already been stated that the volume as
   printed by Jordan (London) in March, contained one single modification of
   that which Johnson had printed in February, but declined to publish. The
   American edition was printed from the Johnson volume; and where the
   English were reading "Many things," etc, the Americans read; "Every thing
   in the English government appears to me the reverse of what it ought to
   be, and of what it is said to be."

   129.                   Paine to Jefferson, dated London, September 28,
   1790: 

   "I enclose you a few observations on the establishment of a Mint. I have
   not seen your report on that subject and therefore cannot tell how nearly
   our opinions run together; but as it is by thinking upon and talking
   subjects over that we approach towards truth, there may probably be
   something in the enclosed that may be of use. -- As the establishment of a
   Mint combines a portion of politics with a knowledge of the Arts, and a
   variety of other matters, it is a subject I shall very much like to talk
   with you upon. I intend at all events to be in America in the Spring, and
   it will please me much to arrive before you have gone thro' the
   arrangement."

   130.                   Madison to Jefferson, July 13th: 

   "I wish you success with all my heart in your efforts for Paine. Besides
   the advantage to him which he deserves, an appointment for him at this
   moment would do public good in various ways."

   Edmund Randolph to Madison, July 21st: 

   "I need not relate to you, that since the standard of republicanism has
   been erected, it has been resorted to by a numerous corps. The newspapers
   will tell you how much the crest of aristocracy has fallen. . . . But he
   [Adams] is impotent, and something is due to past services. Mr. J. and
   myself have attempted to bring Paine forward as a successor to Osgood
   [Postmaster-General]. It seems to be a fair opportunity for a declaration
   of certain sentiments. But all that I have heard has been that it would be
   too pointed to keep vacancy unfilled until his return from the other side
   of the water."

   132.                   "When I arrived in France, the French naturally had
   a great many questions to settle. The first was, whether I was the famous
   Adams. 'Ah, le fameux Adams.' In order to speculate a little upon this
   subject, the pamphlet 'Common Sense' had been printed in the 'Affaires de
   l'Angleterre et de l'Amerique,' and expressly ascribed to Mr. Adams, 'the
   celebrated member of Congress.'   It must be further known that although
   the pamphlet 'Common Sense' was received in France and in all Europe with
   rapture, yet there were certain parts of it that they did not dare to
   publish in France. The reasons of this any man may guess. 'Common
   Sense' undertakes to prove that monarchy is unlawful by the Old Testament.
   They therefore gave the substance of it, as they said; and paying many
   compliments to Mr. Adams, his sense and rich imagination, they were
   obliged to ascribe some parts of it to republican zeal. When I arrived at
   Bordeaux all that I could say or do would not convince anybody but that I
   was the fameux Adams. 'C'est un homme celebre. Votre nom est bien
   connuici.' ['It is a celebrated man. Your name is well known.' -- Digital
   Editor's Translation.]." -- "Works of John Adams," vol. iii., p.189. This
   was in 1779, and when Adams entered on his official duties at Paris the
   honors thrust upon him at Bordeaux became burdensome.

   133.                   Early in May, 1791 (the exact date is not given),
   Lafayette writes Washington: "I send you the rather indifferent
   translation of Mr. Paine as a kind of preservative and to keep me near
   you." This was a hasty translation of "Rights of Man," Part I., by F.
   Soules, presently superseded by that of Lanthenas. -- Conway, The Writings
   of Thomas Paine, vol. iii, Introduction, p.vi.

   134.                   The letter of Christie (Priestley's nephew),
   written June 22d, appeared in the London Morning Chronicle, June 29th.

   135.                   The first convert of Paine to pure republicanism in
   France was Achille Duchatelet, son of the Duke, and grandson of the
   authoress, -- the friend of Voltaire. It was he and Paine who, after the
   flight of Louis XVI., placarded Paris with the Proclamation of a Republic
   [Foner's title "A Republican Manifesto," or Conway's title "The Republican
   Proclamation" ] given as the first chapter of this volume. An account of
   this incident is here quoted from Etienne Dumont's "Recollections of
   Mirabeau": 

   136.                   "How great is a calm, couchant people!   On the
   morrow men will say to one another, 'We have no king, yet we slept sound
   enough.'   On the morrow Achille Duchatelet, and Thomas Paine, the
   rebellious needleman, shall have the walls of Paris profusely plastered
   with their placard, announcing that there must be a republic." -- Carlyle.

   Dumont ("Recollections of Mirabeau") gives a particular account of this
   paper, which Duchatelet wished him to translate. 

   "Paine and he, the one an American, the other a young thoughtless member
   of the French nobility, put themselves forward to change the whole system
   of government in France." Lafayette had been sounded, but said it would
   take twenty years to bring freedom to maturity in France. "But some of the
   seed thrown out by the audacious hand of Paine began to bud forth in the
   minds of many leading individuals." (E. g., Condorcet, Brissot, Petion,
   Claviere.)

   137.                   A Republican Club was formed in July, consisting of
   five members, the others who joined themselves to Paine and Duchatelet
   being Condorcet, and probably Lanthenas (translator of Paine's works), and
   Nicolas de Bonneville. -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii,
   Introduction.

   138.                   "Le Republicain; on le defenseur du gouvernement
   Representatif; par une Societe des Republicains." ["The Republican; On the
   Defence of Representative Government; by a Society of Republicans." --
   Digital Editor's Translation.] A Paris. July 1791. No. 1.

   They advanced so far as to print "Le Republicain," of which, however, only
   one number ever appeared. From it is taken the second piece in this volume
   [Foner's title "Letter to Condorcet, Nicolas De Bonneville, and M.
   Lanthenas," or Conway's title"To the Authors of 'Le Republicain' "]. --
   Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii, Introduction, p.vii.

   139.                   The club, founded in 1789, was called "Jacobin,"
   because they met in the hall of the Dominicans, who had been called
   Jacobins from the street St. Jacques in which they were first established,
   anno 1219.

   140.                   It was probably this letter that Gouverneur Morris
   alludes to in his "Diary," when, writing of a Fourth of July dinner given
   by Mr. Short (U. S. Charge d'Affaires), he mentions the presence of Paine,
   "inflated to the eyes and big with a letter of Revolutions."

   141.                   In this spirit was written Part I. of "The Rights
   of Man" whose translation by M. Lanthenas, with new preface, appeared in
   May. Sieyes agreed that "hereditaryship" was theoretically wrong, "but,"
   he said, "refer to the histories of all elective monarchies and
   principalities: is there one in which the elective mode is not worse than
   the hereditary succession?" For notes on this incident see Professor F. A.
   Aulard's important work, "Les Orateurs de l'Assemblee
   Constituante," p.411. Also Henri Martin's"Histoire de France," i., p. 193.

   142.                   "Souvenirs sur Mirabeau." Par Etienne Dumont.

   143.                   "I have always been opposed to the mode of refining
   government up to an individual, or what is called a single Executive. Such
   a man will always be the chief of a party. A plurality is far better. It
   combines the mass of a nation better together. And besides this, it is
   necessary to the manly mind of a republic that it lose the debasing idea
   of obeying an individual." Paine MS.

   144.                   Paine may, indeed, only have apprehended
   alterations, which he always dreaded. His friends, knowing how much his
   antagonists had made of his grammatical faults, sometimes suggested expert
   revision. "He would say," says Richard Carlile, "that he only wished to be
   known as he was, without being decked with the plumes of another."

   At the time (September) when Chapman began printing Paine's Part II,
   George Chalmers brought to the same press his libellous "Life of Pain." On
   learning that Chapman was printing Paine, Chalmers took his book away. As
   Chalmers was a government employe, and his work larger, Chapman returned
   Paine's work to him half printed, and the Chalmers book was restored to
   him. As Chapman stated in his testimony, and so wrote to Paine (January
   17, 1792), that he was unwilling to go on with the printing because of the
   dangerous tendency of a part of it, his offer of a thousand guineas for it
   could only have contemplated its expurgation or total suppression. That it
   was the latter, and that the money was to be paid by the government, is
   rendered probable by the evidences in Chalmers' book, when it appeared,
   that he had been allowed the perusal of Paine's manuscript while in
   Chapman's hands. Chalmers also displays intimate knowledge of Chapman's
   business transactions with Paine.

   145.                   Not that Chalmers confines himself to perversions
   of fact. The book bore on its title-page five falsehoods: "Pain," instead
   of "Paine"; "Francis Oldys"; "A. M." "University of Pennsylvania"; "With a
   Defence of his Writings." There is a marked increase of virulence with the
   successive editions. The second is in cheap form, and bears at the back of
   its title this note: "Read this, and then hand it to others who are
   requested to do likewise."

   who met in the London Coffee House, May 9, 1792, and founded the Society
   of Friends of the People." -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol.
   iv, Introduction, p.xi.

   148.                   "Pitt 'used to say,' according to Lady Hester
   Stanhope, 'that Tom Paine was quite in the right, but then he would add,
   what am I to do? As things are, if I were to encourage Tom Paine's
   opinions we should have a bloody revolution. --  "Encyclop. Britannica."

   149.                   The French Minister in London, Chauvelin, had sent
   to his government (still royalist) a despatch unfavorable to Paine's work
   in England, part of which I translate: 

   "May 23, 1792

   "An Association [for Parliamentary Reform, see Letter Addressed To The
   Addressers On The Late Proclamation, pp.78 (Foner ed., p.497), 93 (Foner
   ed., p.510), of this volume] has been formed to seek the means of
   forwarding the demand. It includes some distinguished members of the
   Commons, and a few peers. The writings of M. Payne which preceded this
   Association by a few days have done (p.ix) it infinite harm. People
   suspect under the veil of a reform long demanded by justice and reason an
   intention to destroy a constitution equally dear to the peers whose
   privileges it consecrates, to the wealthy whom it protects, and to the
   entire nation, to which it assures all the liberty desired by a people
   ethodical and slow in character, and who, absorbed in their commercial
   interests, do not like being perpetually worried about the imbecile George
   III or public affairs. Vainly have the friends of reform protested their
   attachment to the Constitution. Vainly they declare that they desire to
   demand nothing, to obtain nothing, save in lawful ways. They are
   persistently disbelieved. Payne alone is seen in all their movements; and
   this author has not, like Mackintosh, rendered imposing his refutation of
   Burke. The members of the Association, although very different in
   principles, find themselves involved in the now almost general disgrace of
   Payne."

   -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii, Introduction,
   p.viii-ix.

   150.                   "I happened to be in England at the celebration of
   the centenary of the Revolution of 1688. The characters of William and
   Mary have always appeared to me detestable; the one seeking to destroy his
   uncle, the other her father, to get possession of power themselves; yet,
   as the nation was disposed to think something of the event, I felt hurt at
   seeing it ascribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken
   it as a job; and who besides what he otherwise got, charged six hundred
   thousand pounds for the expense of the little fleet that brought him from
   Holland. George the First acted the same close-fisted part as William had
   done, and bought the Duchy of Bremen with the money he got from England,
   two hundred and fifty thousand pounds over and above his pay as King; and,
   having thus purchased it at the expense of England, added it to his
   Hanoverian dominions for his own private profit. In fact every nation that
   does not govern itself is governed as a job. England has been the prey of
   jobs ever since the Revolution."

   151.                   To this noble pensioner and sinecurist he says:
   "What honour or happiness you can derive from being the principal pauper
   of the neighborhood, and occasioning a greater expence than the poor, the
   aged, and the infirm for ten miles round, I leave you to enjoy. At the
   same time I can see that it is no wonder you should be strenuous in
   suppressing a book which strikes at the root of these abuses."

   159.                   Early in the year 1792 Paine lodged in the house
   and book-shop of Thomas "Clio" Rickman, now as then 7 Upper Marylebone
   Street. Among his friends was the mystical artist and poet, William Blake.
   Paine had become to him a transcendental type; he is one of the Seven who
   appear in Blake's "Prophecy" concerning America (1793):

   "The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent. 
    Sullen fires across the Atlantic glow to America's shore; 
    Piercing the souls of warlike men, who rise in silent night: 
    Washington, Franklin, Paine, and Warren, Gates, Hancock, and Greene, 
    Meet on the coast glowing with blood from Albion's fiery Prince."

   (p.viii) The Seven are wrapt in the flames of their enthusiasm. Albion's
   Prince sends to America his thirteen Angels, who, however, there become
   Governors of the thirteen States. It is difficult to discover from Blake's
   mystical visions how much political radicalism was in him, but he
   certainly saved Paine from the scaffold by forewarning him (September 13,
   1792) that an order had been issued for his arrest. Without repeating the
   story told in Gilchrist's "Life of Blake," and in my "The Life of Thomas
   Paine," I may add here my belief that Paine also appears in one of Blake's
   pictures. The picture is in the National Gallery (London), and called "The
   spiritual form of Pitt guiding Behemoth." The monster jaws of Behemoth are
   full of struggling men, some of whom stretch imploring hands to another
   spiritual form, who reaches down from a crescent moon in the sky, as if to
   rescue them. This face and form appear to me certainly meant for Paine. --

   after some trouble, related in a letter to Dundas (see Letter To Mr.
   Secretary Dundas, June 6, 1792), he reached Calais. -- Conway, The
   Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii, Introduction, p.viii.

   161.                   He had been elected by four departments to the
   National Convention, and selected Calais, where he was welcomed with grand
   civic parades. -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii,
   Introduction, p.viii.

   162.                   On September 19, 1792, he arrived in Paris,
   stopping at "White's Hotel," 7 Passage des Petits Peres, about five
   minutes' walk from the Salle de Manege, where, on September 21st, the
   National Convention opened its sessions. The spot is now indicated by a
   tablet on the wall of the Tuileries Garden, Rue de Rivoli. -- Conway, The
   Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii, Introduction, p.viii.

   163.                   Lord Semphill, John Frost, D. Adams, and "Joel-Joel
   the Prophet" (Joel Barlow) . . . were among those who, towards the close
   of 1792, formed a sort of Paine Club at "Philadelphia House" as White's
   Hotel was now called. The men gathered around Paine, as the exponent of
   republican principles, were animated by a passion for liberty which
   withheld no sacrifice. Some of them threw away wealth and rank as trifles.
   At a banquet of the Club, at Philadelphia House, November 18, 1792, where
   Paine presided, Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Sir Robert Smyth, Baronet,
   formally (p.xiii) renounced their titles. Sir Robert proposed the toast,
   "A speedy abolition of all hereditary titles and feudal distinctions."
   Another toast was, "Paine -- and the new way of making good books known by
   a Royal proclamation and a King's Bench prosecution."

   There was also Franklin's friend, Benjamin Vaughan, Member of Parliament,
   who, compromised by an intercepted letter, took refuge in Paris under the
   name of Jean Martin. Other Englishmen were Rev. Jeremiah Joyce, a
   Unitarian minister and author (coadjutor of Dr. Gregory in his
   Cyclopaedia"); Henry Redhead Yorke, a West Indian with some negro blood
   (afterwards an agent of Pitt, under whom he had been imprisoned); Robert
   Merry, husband of the actress "Miss Brunton"; Sayer, Rayment, Macdonald,
   Perry.

   Sampson Perry of London, having attacked the government in his journal,
   "The Argus," fled from an indictment, and reached Paris in January, 1793.
   These men, who for a time formed at Philadelphia House their Parliament of
   Man, were dashed by swift storms on their several rocks. Sir Robert Smyth
   was long a prisoner under the Reign of Terror, and died (1802) of the
   illness thereby contracted. Lord Edward Fitzgerald was slain while trying
   to kindle a revolution in Ireland. Perry was a prisoner in the Luxembourg,
   and afterwards in London. John Frost, a lawyer (struck off the roll),
   ventured back to London, where he was imprisoned six months in Newgate,
   sitting in the pillory at Charing Cross one hour per day. Robert Merry
   went to Baltimore, where he died in 1798. Nearly all of these men suffered
   griefs known only to the "man without a country." -- Conway, The Writings
   of Thomas Paine, vol. iii, Introduction, p.xii-xiii.

   164.                   "Father of his People" was a title of Geo. III.
   "Father of his Country" was applied to Peyton Randolph, first president of
   Congress. Paine's essay, quoted above, which is not included in the
   editions of Paine's works, was printed by James Watson in London, 1843,
   the translation being by W. J. Linton, who, while editing
   the National, also wrote the same year, and for the same publisher, a
   small but useful "Life of Paine."

   the Historical Exhibition of the Revolution, in Paris, 1889. This letter
   of the "philosophe anglais," as he is described in the catalogue, is in
   the collection of M. Charavay, and was framed with the Bonneville portrait
   of Paine.

   167.                   In his republican manifesto at the time of the
   king's flight he had deprecated revenge towards the captured monarch.

   168.                   "That which will astonish posterity is that at
   Stockholm, five months after the death of Gustavus, and while the northern
   Powers are leaguing themselves against the liberty of France, there has
   been published a translation of Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man," the
   translator being one of the King's secretaries!" -- Moniteur, Nov. 8,
   1792.

   169.                   "Diary and Letters." The letter was probably
   written with knowledge of its liability to fall into the hands of the
   French Committee. It could not deceive Wycombe.

   171.                   This essay has suffered in the translation found in
   English and American editions of Paine. The words "national magnanimity"
   are omitted. The phrase "brigands couronnes" becomes "crowned robbers" in
   England, and "crowned ruffians" in America. Both versions are commonplace,
   and convey an impression of haste and mere abuse. But Paine was a slow
   writer, and weighed his words even when "quarelling in print." when this
   letter was written to the Convention its members were reading his Essay on
   Royalty, which filled seven columns of Brissot's Patriote Franc,ais three
   weeks before. In that he had traced royalty to the bandit-chief. "Several
   troops of banditti assemble for the purpose of upsetting some country, of
   laying contributions over it, of seizing the landed property, of reducing
   the people to thraldom. The expedition being accomplished, the chief of
   the gang assumes the title of king or monarch. Such has been the origin of
   royalty among all nations who live by the chase, agriculture, or the
   tending of flocks. A second chieftain arriving obtains by force what has
   been acquired by violence. He despoils his predecessor, loads him with
   fetters, puts him to death, and assumes his title. In the course of ages
   the memory of the outrage is lost; his successors establish new forms of
   government; through policy, they become the instruments of a little good;
   they invent, or cause to be invented, false genealogical tables; they
   employ every means to render their race sacred; the knavery of priests
   steps in to their assistance; for their body-guard they take religion
   itself; then it is that Royalty, or rather Tyranny, becomes immortal. A
   power unjustly usurped is transformed into a hereditary right."

   of the Somme, Concerning the Judgment of Louis XVI. Preceded by his
   Consigned Letter to the President of the Convention. Printed by Order of
   the National Convention. In Paris. By The National Printer."--  Digital
   Editor's Translation.]   It is very remarkable that, in a State paper,
   Paine should be described as deputy for the Somme. His votes in the
   Convention are all entered under Calais. Dr. John Moore, who saw much of
   Paine at this time, says, in his work on the French Revolution, that his
   (Paine's) writings for the Convention were usually translated into French
   by the Marchioness of Condorcet.

   174.                   M. Noel writes from London, November 2, 1792, to
   the republican Minister, Le Brun, concerning the approaching trial of
   Paine, which had been fixed for December 18th:

   "This matter above all excites the liveliest interest. People desire to
   know whether they live in a free country, where criticism even of
   government is a right of every citizen. Whatever may be the decision in
   this interesting trial, the result can only be fortunate for the cause of
   liberty. But the government cannot conceal from itself that it is
   suspended over a volcano. The wild dissipations of the King's sons add to
   the discontent, and if something is overlooked in the Prince of Wales, who
   is loved enough, it is not so with the Duke of York, who has few friends.
   The latter has so many debts that at this moment the receivers are in his
   house, and the creditors wish even his bed to be seized. You perceive,
   Citizen, what a text fruitful in reflexions this conduct presents to a
   people groaning under the weight of taxes for the support of such whelps
   (louvetaux)."

   -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol. iii, Introduction, p.ix.

   175.                   At the trial the Attorney-General admitted that he
   had not prosecuted Part I. because it was likely to be confined to
   judicious readers: but this still more reprehensible Part II. was, he
   said, with an industry incredible, ushered into the world in all shapes
   and sizes, thrust into the hands of subjects of every description, even
   children's sweetmeats being wrapped in it.

   176.                   This disclosure, though not disproved, is passed
   over silently by most historians. Nevertheless it was probably that which
   ended Burke's parliamentary career. Two years later, at the age of
   sixty-two, he retired with an accumulation of pensions given at the king's
   request, amounting to -L-3,700 per annum. His reputation had been built up
   on his supposed energy in favor of economy. The secret and illegal pension
   (-L-1,500) cast light on his sudden coalition with Lord North, whom he
   once proposed to impeach as a traitor. The title of "masked pensioner"
   given by Paine branded Burke. Writing in 1819 Cobbett says; "As my Lord
   Grenville introduced the name of Burke, suffer me, my Lord, to introduce
   that of the man [Paine] who put this Burke to shame, who drove him off the
   public stage to seek shelter in the pension list, and who is now named
   fifty million times where the name of the pensioned Burke is mentioned
   once."

   177.                   From the papers of Francis Place (British Museum),
   it appears that the work of repressing political discussion was begun by
   the Lord Mayor, who on November 27, 1792, closed the debating society
   which had been meeting at the King's Arms, Cornhill. (By the diary of
   Paine's friend, John Hall, I find that after the information had been
   lodged against Paine, all of the debating societies in London were
   intimidated, and the King's Arms debate had come down to the question,
   "Whether a husband obstinate and ignorant, or a man of parts, though
   tyrannical, was the most eligible for woman of refined sensibilities?"
   Hall adds:" Did not stay to the end, but it seemed to be going in favor of
   the sensible man, the tyrant." Whether the Lord Mayor scented sedition in
   such questions or not, John Hall, after some absence from London, enters
   in his diary, November 26, "Could not find where Debating Society met.")

   In the Francis Place MSS., 27, 809, p. 268, there is a list of the
   prosecutions in 1793; and in 27, 812, pp.10, 12, are documents showing
   that about the middle of June, 1792, subscriptions had been opened, for
   the defence of Paine, by both the "London Corresponding Committee" and the
   "Constitutional Society." -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol.
   iv, Introduction, p.xi.

   178.                   The prosecution of the Second Part of the Rights of
   Man, (p.x) and the panic caused by massacres in France, thinned the ranks
   of Paine's eminent friends, while the popularity of his work increased.
   Malone, writing from London to Charlemont, December 3, 1792, says: "For
   several weeks past not less than four thousand per week of Paine's
   despicable and nonsensical pamphlet have been issued forth, for almost
   nothing, and dispersed all over the kingdom. At Manchester the innovators
   bribe the poor by drink to hear it read."

   Malone (Edmund, the Shakespearian) was an admirable Irishman, but he seems
   to have been taken off his feet by the court-panic in London. There is a
   touch of comedy in finding him bringing out a quarto with a republican
   publisher:

   "This person," he tells Charlemont, November 15, 1793, "a Mr. George
   Robinson, is unluckily too a determined republican, on which account alone
   I am sorry that I have employed him. In consequence of his political
   frenzy he at this moment is apprehensive of judgment being pronounced
   against him by the king's bench for selling Paine's pamphlet, and may
   probably be punished for his zeal in the 'good old cause,' as they called
   it in the last century, by six months' imprisonment. I shall not have the
   smallest pity for him. To do any act whatever that may tend to forward the
   principles maintained by the diabolical ruffians in France is so highly
   criminal that I hope the chief justice will inflict the most exemplary
   punishment on all the favorers of that vile system, whenever he can lay
   hold on them."

   Robinson had been found guilty August 10, and when called up for judgment
   seems to have escaped with a fine (p.xi) (Sherwin's "Paine," p.138).
   Before leaving the Charlemont Papers it may be remarked that in no case
   does the Earl respond to Malone's acrimonious language against Paine, and
   even when the good Catholic has before him the author's direst offenses,
   he limits himself in writing to Haliday (long since scared) to a mild
   sentence:   "So Paine has now attacked Washington!   No wonder; he has
   lately dared to attack heaven." -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas
   Paine, vol. iv, Introduction, p.ix-xi.

   179.                   Under date of December 22, 1792, M. Noel writes:

   "London is perfectly tranquil. The arbitrary measures taken by the
   government in advance [of Paine's trial] cause no anxiety to the mass of
   the nation about its liberties. Some (p.x) clear-headed people see well
   that the royal prerogative will gain in this crisis, and that it is
   dangerous to leave executive power to become arbitrary at pleasure; but
   this very small number groan in silence, and dare not speak for fear of
   seeing their property pillaged or burned by what the miserable hirelings
   of government call 'Loyal Mob,' or 'Church and King Mob.'   To the
   'Addressers,' of whom I wrote you, are added the associations for
   maintaining the Constitution they are doing all they can to destroy. There
   is no corporation, no parish, which is not mustered for this object. All
   have assembled, one on the other, to press against those whom they call
   'The Republicans and the Levellers,' the most inquisitorial measures.
   Among other parishes, one (S. James' Vestry Room) distinguishes itself by
   a decree worthy of the sixteenth century. It promises twenty guineas
   reward to any one who shall denounce those who in conversation or
   otherwise propagate opinions contrary to the public tranquillity, and
   places the denouncer under protection of the parish. The inhabitants of
   London are now placed under a new kind of Test, and those who refuse it
   will undoubtedly be persecuted. Meantime these papers are carried from
   house to house to be signed, especially by those lodging as strangers.
   This Test causes murmurs, and some try to evade signature, but the number
   is few. The example of the capital is generally followed.

   "The trial of Payne, which at one time seemed likely to cause events, has
   ended in the most peaceful way. Erskine has been borne to his house by
   people shouting God Save the King!   Erskine forever!   The friends of
   liberty generally are much dissatisfied with the way in which he has
   defended his client. They find that he threw himself into commonplaces
   which could make his eloquence shine, but guarded himself well from going
   to the bottom of the question. Vane especially, a distinguished advocate
   and zealous democrat, is furious against Erskine. It is now for Payne to
   defend himself. But whatever he does, he will have trouble enough to
   reverse the opinion. The jury's verdict is generally applauded: a mortal
   blow is dealt to freedom of thought. People sing in the streets, even at
   midnight, God save the King and damn Tom Payne!"

   instruction in a collection, now in the British Museum, of coins and
   medals mostly struck after the trial and outlawry of Paine. A half-penny,
   January 21, 1793: obverse, a man hanging on a gibbet, with church in the
   distance; motto "End of Pain"; reverse, open book inscribed "The Wrongs of
   Man." A token: bust of Paine, with his name; reverse, "The Mountain in
   Labour, 1793." Farthing: Paine gibbeted; reverse, breeches burning,
   legend, "Pandora's breeches"; beneath, serpent decapitated by a dagger,
   the severed head that of Paine. Similar farthing,
   but reverse, combustibles intermixed with labels issuing from a globe
   marked "Fraternity"; the labels inscribed "Regicide," "Robbery,"
   "Falsity," "Requisition"; legend, "French Reforms, 1797"; near by, a
   church with flag, on it a cross. Half-penny without date, but no doubt
   struck in 1794, when a rumor reached London that Paine had been
   guillotined: Paine gibbeted; above, devil smoking a pipe; reverse, monkey
   dancing; legend, "We dance, Paine swings." Farthing: three men hanging on
   a gallows; "The Three Thomases, 1796." Reverse, "May the three knaves of
   Jacobin Clubs never get a trick." The Three Thomases were Thomas Paine,
   Thomas Muir, and Thomas Spence. In 1794 Spence was imprisoned seven months
   for publishing some of Paine's works at his so-called "Hive of Liberty."
   Muir, a Scotch lawyer, was banished to Botany Bay for fourteen years for
   having got up in Edinburgh (1792) a "Convention," in imitation of that
   just opened in Paris; two years later he escaped from Botany Bay on an
   American ship, and found his way to Paine in Paris. Among these coins
   there are two of opposite character. A farthing represents Pitt on a
   gibbet, against which rests a ladder; inscription, "End of P [here an eye]
   T." Reverse, face of Pitt conjoined with that of the devil, and legend,
   "Even Fellows." Another farthing like the last, except an added legend,
   "Such is the reward of tyrants, 1796." These anti-Pitt farthings were
   struck by Thomas Spence. -- Conway, The Writings of Thomas Paine, vol.

   183.                   In the winter of 1792-3 the only Reign of Terror
   was in England. The Ministry had replied to Paine's "Rights of
   Man" (p.xii) by a royal proclamation against seditious literature,
   surrounding London with militia, and calling a meeting of Parliament
   (December, 1792) out of season. Even before the trial of Paine his case
   was prejudged by the royal proclamation, and by the Addresses got up
   throughout the country in response, -- documents which elicited
   Paine's Address to the Addressers, chapter IX. in this volume III. The
   Tory gentry employed roughs to burn Paine in effigy throughout the
   country, and to harry the Non-conformists. Dr. Priestley's house was
   gutted. Mr. Fox (December 14, 1792) reminded the House of Commons that all
   the mobs had"Church and King" for their watchword, no mob having been
   heard of for "The Rights of Man" ; and he vainly appealed to the
   government to prosecute the dangerous libels against Dissenters as they
   were prosecuting Paine's work. Burke, who in the extra session of
   Parliament for the first time took his seat on the Treasury Bench, was
   reminded that he had once "exulted at the victories of that rebel
   Washington," and welcomed Franklin. "Franklin," he said, "was a native of
   America; Paine was born in England, and lived under the protection of our
   laws; but, instigated by his evil genius, he conspired against the very
   country which gave him birth, by attempting to introduce the new and
   pernicious doctrines of republicans."

   In the course of the same harangue, Burke alluded to the English and Irish
   deputations, then in Paris, which had congratulated the Convention on the
   defeat of the invaders of the Republic. Among them he named Lord Semphill,
   John Frost, D. Adams, and "Joel-Joel the Prophet" (Joel Barlow). These men
   were among those who, towards the close of 1792, formed a sort of Paine
   Club at "Philadelphia House " as White's Hotel was now called. --

   184.                   22 Howell's State Trials 357. Other reports are by
   Joseph Gurney and "by an eminent advocate." The brief evidence consisted
   mainly of the notes and statements of Paine's publishers already mentioned
   in connection with the publication of the indicted work. The
   Attorney-General cited effectively the reply to Paine which he attributed
   to Vice-President Adams. Publicola's pamphlet gave great comfort to
   Paine's prosecutors. Mr. Long writes to Mr. Miles, agent in Paris
   (December 1st), about this "book by the American Adams, which is
   admirable, proving that the American government is not founded upon the
   absurd doctrine of the pretended rights of man, and that if it had been it
   could not have stood for a week."

   185.                   And on December 22, four days after Paine's trial,
   Malone has the satisfaction of reporting:

   "That vain fellow Erskine has been going about this month past, saying he
   would make a speech in defence of Paine's nonsensical and impudent libel
   on the English constitution, that would astonish the world, and make him
   to be remembered when Pitt and Fox and Burke, etc., were all forgotten.
   After speaking for four hours, and fainting in the usual form, the jury,
   without suffering the attorney-general to reply, found Paine guilty."

   186.                   After September it was, as Talleyrand says, "no
   longer a question that the king should reign, but that he himself, the
   queen, their children, his sister, should be saved. It might have been
   done. It was at least a duty to attempt it. At that time France was only
   at war with the Emperor [Austria], the Empire [the German states], and
   Sardinia. Had all the other states concerted themselves to offer their
   mediation by proposing to recognise whatever form of government France
   might be pleased to adopt, with the sole condition that the prisoners in
   the Temple should be allowed to leave the country and retire wherever they
   liked, though such a proposal, as may be supposed, would not have filled
   the demagogues with delight, they would have been powerless to resist it."

   188.                   In relating to John Randolph of Roanoke Paine's
   exposure of Silas Deane, Morris regards it as the prevention of a fraud,
   but nevertheless thinks Paine deserved punishment for his "impudence"!

   men as Frost, Barlow, and others, your associates, show the forlornness of
   your cause. Our respectable citizens do not go to you," etc. Writing
   February 11th, King expresses satisfaction at Paine's vote on the King's
   fate: "the imputation of cruelty will not now be added to the other
   censures on your character; but the catastrophe of this unhappy Monarch
   has shewn you the danger of putting a nation in ferment."
