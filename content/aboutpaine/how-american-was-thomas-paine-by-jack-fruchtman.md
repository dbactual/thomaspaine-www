        Did Paine think of himself as an American? Or was he a self-styled
   "citizen of the world," as he himself sometimes claimed? Clearly, he was a
   figure who articulated a radical vision of the world, so radical in fact
   that most commentators do not think of him as having a national, but only
   (and solely) an international consciousness. Recently, Thomas Walker
   argues, for example, "Paine was the first to offer an integrated, modern,
   cosmopolitan vision of international relations. Cosmopolitanism consists
   of more than a defiance of strict national attachments and a commitment to
   world citizenship." This assessment echoed that of David Fitzsimons just a
   few years ago.1 Mark Philp, in his able addition to the Oxford Past
   Masters series, emphasizes Paine's internationalism through his concept of
   "universal civilization."2 Ian Dyck has confirmed this view when he says,
   "Paine put little store in these [national] citizenships, preferring to
   identify himself as a citizen of the world who held national
   identifications in contempt."3 John Keane gives a slightly different
   picture.  Keane's view was that Paine's linkage of national
   self-determination with democratic rights and liberty provided a
   foundation for all modern-day national revolutionary movements, despite
   the seeming contradiction between nation and democracy( because the
   collective nature of nationalism seemed to Keane to work against the
   individualism and liberty).4  More recently (and rather curiously), Keane
   has tried to transform Paine into the consummate Englishman.5

    
         The real question is whether Paine offers us any clear vision of his
   view of his own national sentiments on two grounds: first, was he
   concerned with the meaning of an eighteenth-century national
   consciousness, and second, what did it mean to him to be an American? I
   will argue that when Paine first emigrated to America from England in
   1774, he was most likely uncertain of whom he was in terms of his
   nationality. This uncertainty remained with him until he resolved it
   during the French Revolution while living in Paris. It was not, however,
   to France that he turned as the object of his national consciousness, but
   rather to America. Evidence in his major writings and correspondence shows
   that although he lived in Philadelphia and its outskirts for only thirteen
   years (1774-87), it was there that he developed what might be called
   American national sensibilities. In Pennsylvania, he achieved the positive
   feeling that he was, affirmatively, an American. This sentiment stood in
   stark contrast to what other Americans seemed to possess, namely the
   negative feeling that they were not Europeans. Ironically, Paine never
   realized his "American-ness" while he was living in America. On the
   contrary he developed it only after he left Philadelphia in 1787 and
   headed to Europe where he remained for the next fifteen years. Finally, we
   will have to come to terms with Paine's commitment to internationalism,
   which, I think, may well fit into his self-identification as an American.
    
        "National consciousness" was an affirmative assertion of national
   identity rather than the negative idea that many Americans identified
   themselves by what they were not. It is difficult to determine when
   Americans began to develop a positive national consciousness in their own
   right. If Americans knew that they were not Europeans, what did they think
   they were? A true national consciousness does not merely ask what one is
   not. It does not presume the negative, but, on the contrary demands a
   positive affirmation and identity with one's nation and its future. In
   this sense, it is more than patriotism, which suggests a fervent loyalty
   to country and a desire to protect it. Patriotism lacks the intensity of
   identification that citizens feel toward their own people, their mores,
   their language, and their future evolution. For Americans to say that they
   distinguished an "old world" from a "new" one certainly said something
   about what they thought of themselves. Benjamin Franklin perhaps best
   summarized this older view in 1775, when he expressed a sense of American
   self-identity in truly negative terms. For Franklin,
    
   When I consider the extreme corruption
   prevalent among all orders of men in this old
   rotten state, and the glorious public virtue so
   predominant in our rising country, I cannot
   but apprehend more mischief than benefit
   from a closer union. I fear they will drag us
   after them in all their plundering wars,
   which their desperate circumstances,
   injustice and rapacity may prompt them to
   undertake, and their wide-wasting
   prodigality and profusion is a gulf that will
   swallow up every aid we may distress
   ourselves to afford them. Here numberless
   and needless places, enormous salaries,
   pensions, perquisites, bribes, groundless
   quarrels, foolish expeditions, false accounts
   or no accounts, contracts and I jobs, devour
   all revenue and produce continual necessity
   in the midst of natural plenty.6
    
        Americans perceived the differences between two worlds, separated by
   the great gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, as being serious and deep, often
   perilous and unfathomable.
    
        Franklin's words were written from London in 1775. Nearly twenty
   years later, we can see the beginning of a shift in emphasis from
   differentness to distinctiveness, in large part due to the self-conscious
   nationalism of Thomas Paine. Paine was forced to resolve the problem of
   his own nationality while incarcerated for a year in the Luxembourg Prison
   during the Reign of Terror. But it was his earlier Philadelphia experience
   that gave him the grounding for rooting his feelings in a genuine American
   national consciousness. His struggle with who he was his
   self-identification with a homeland-paralleled his own inability to remain
   in one place. Residing in various towns and parishes throughout England
   during the first thirty-seven years of his life, he moved to Philadelphia
   when he came to America in 1774, only to return to England in 1787.
   Traveling back and forth between London and Paris for five years, he had
   to leave England forever in 1792 after he was found guilty (in absentia)
   of seditious libel for publishing Rights of Man. For the next ten years,
   Paine remained in France, a supporter and participant in French
   revolutionary activities, including service in the French National
   Convention, until he himself fell victim to the Terror. Even after his
   release from prison, thanks in large part to the American minister to
   Paris, James Monroe, Paine remained in Paris until he returned to America
   in 1802.
    
        Just months before the United States of America, as an independent
   country came into being in 1776, Paine had urged in Common Sense that the
   Americans to separate from their British overseers. But his was a call
   that went beyond the necessities of political oppression. He also wanted
   to emphasize those same differences that Franklin had alluded to, which
   set the Americans apart from their English cousins. In his famous,
   often-quoted statement that, "We [the Americans] have it in our power to
   begin the world over again," he told his new countrymen that America was
   different, because of its newness, and that its differences distinguished
   it from those nations of the old world that Franklin had roundly
   condemned.7 During the American Revolution, which broke out just six
   months later, Paine was unequivocally the true American patriot. But to be
   a patriot does not necessarily connote a national consciousness. It took
   something far more than the willingness of a people to cast aside those
   negative features that they find afflicting them from some old world
   configuration. The Continental Army's retreat from the Hudson across the
   Delaware in the cold December of 1776 stimulated words from Paine's pen
   about patriotism that would become timelessly famous. But what he wrote at
   that bleak moment of the war was an appeal to patriotism, to Americans'
   differentness from their European taskmasters. At one of the grimmest
   points of the war, when all seemed lost, on one very cold night Paine
   wrote the words, so the legend goes, by the light of a campfire on the top
   of a drumhead. His words gave credence to what he thought was pure
   American steadfastness and patriotism:
    
   These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the
   sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their
   country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man
   and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this
   consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the
   triumph.8
    
        The Americans certainly were no "sunshine patriots," but a special
   breed with a sense of mission to separate themselves from their British
   taskmasters. Americans had, he had written in Common Sense, the
   opportunity "to form the noblest, purest constitution on the face of the
   earth."9  Their destiny was so different from those who lived in the old
   world because they were now becoming that new breed of people whom
   Crevecoeur had wondered about while farming in Pine Hill in New York. They
   comprised a new order of men, a veritable new race:
    
   What, then, is-the American, this new man? He is neither an European nor
   the descendant of an European; hence that strange mixture or blood, which
   you will find in no other country. He is an American, who, leaving behind
   him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new
   mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new
   rank he holds ... Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new
   race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes
   in the world.10
    
        The Americans' separation from Britain and their new constitution
   required tremendously heroic effort and sacrifice if they were to further
   that distinction between themselves and the rest of the world. Only at
   that point would they finally achieve something that no other people had
   ever before accomplished. Only at that point would they at long last see
   themselves as a distinctive people in their own right without the
   comparative negativism that characterized their early years.
    
        Paine's ideas about his own national consciousness evolved from this
   time onward in ways that paralleled the way in which Americans were
   thinking about themselves. In 1776, he understood that a true national
   consciousness had to move beyond politics and constitution making. And
   yet, despite his adulation of the American cause and its inherent justice,
   indeed of things generally American, Paine's national consciousness, his
   sense of being an American, seemed very uneven while in America in the
   1770s and 1780s. It still contained the baggage of sorting through the
   differences between those characteristics which made some people
   Americans, others Europeans, and some still English. His views, especially
   of his own place in the world, in this period were often confused and
   muddled, but it was in Philadelphia that the seeds of his American
   consciousness were first planted. Once out of America, these seeds would
   fully develop as he longed to return to his adopted home. After the French
   Revolution, but still during his years in France, Paine's encounter with
   the doctrines of Jean-Jacques Rousseau gave him a new perspective of the
   meaning of national consciousness. Rousseau, it will be recalled, was far
   more interested in investigating how society might achieve collective
   freedom and responsibility rather than only anomic individual rights: the
   rights and freedom of the nation as a whole, that is, not only those of
   the single person.
    
        In 1789, in one of his most succinct definitions of "nation," Paine
   wrote that "a nation is only a great individual," whereby the collective
   personality of the people congealed to form a single composite whole.11
    This aggregate could be compared to a single person: if the nation, like
   a person, had a good or bad character, then a person could decide whether
   that nation would make a good "neighbor." A nation was not society, per
   se, nor was it government. It was prior to both because it comprised the
   collective organization of human beings who act synchronously in all
   regard. Thus, he understood the organic nature of nations that united the
   people of a nation, an idea that Paine adopted from Rousseau's writings,
   which he knew well, and often cited and often quoted.12
    
        This Rousseauist element runs throughout the second part of Rights of
   Man (1792). There, Paine mused about the nature of a nation, about
   nationhood, about nationality and nationalism. "A nation is not a body,
   the figure of which is to be represented by the human body," he said.
   Hence, in terms of a nation, there is no Hobbesian body natural, which is
   reified as the body politic (Thomas Hobbes's frontispiece to his great
   1751 work depicted Leviathan - the state in all its grandeur - as being
   comprised of the thousands of individual heads of its subjects). Paine
   continued: a nation "is like a body contained within a circle, having a
   common center, in which every radius meets." A nation was more than simply
   being united. It is bound together by the perimeter of the circle. It
   "possesses a perpetual stamina, as well of  body as of mind."13  Nations
   had basic rights. Among these was the right of the people to form their
   own constitutions, as Paine had indicated years earlier in Common Sense.
   Only now his emphasis had changed: the nation as a whole had to form it
   collectively. It could not be created by only a few individuals because "a
   nation can have no interest in being wrong."14  No nation would ever do
   anything that was ruinous to itself. People, acting as solitary
   individuals, might destroy their nation inadvertently, even as they
   claimed that they were acting on its behalf. A nation in its collective
   self would never destroy itself.
    
        Paine addressed this very issue in a letter to James Monroe in 1794.
   The American people might have called themselves "Americans" before July
   4, 1776, but they were not really so until after that date. "The Americans
   were not called citizens till after the government was established," he
   said, "and not even then until they had taken the oath of allegiance."15
   Once they were bona fide American, they were not "summer soldiers" or
   "sunshine patriots," but a manly lot, and he included himself among them.
   He claimed to have taken the oath of allegiance to the United States of
   America on two occasions, once in I776, again in 1777.16 Ironically
   Paine's encounter with Rousseauist ideas coupled with his experiences,
   first unknowingly, in America, but later in France, helped him realize
   that he was first an American, and in so doing he resolved his problem of
   national consciousness. Writing from France just after the Revolution had
   occurred. he mentioned how much he missed "my much loved America. It is
   the country from
   whence all reformation must originally spring."17 His years in
   Philadelphia seemed now to have
   been more powerfully inspirational than he himself had ever imagined while
   he actually lived there.
    
        Paine's newly minted American spirit now became firmly rooted in his
   own consciousness. Curiously, despite his newfound sense of being an
   American, in August of 1792, the French National Assembly made him a
   citizen. Just a few days before he was informed of the honor, on August
   l0th, Paris mobs attacked the National Assembly, which immediately
   suspended itself and removed the king from office. Thereafter, Louis XVI
   and his family were locked in the Temple for safekeeping. Paine was soon
   among seventeen foreigners honored with citizenship
   (the others included George Washington, Joseph Priestley, Jeremy Bentham,
   James Madison, and other republican leaders and writers in America,
   England, and elsewhere). Within a few
   weeks, he was elected to the National Convention, the successor to the
   Assembly, which was charged with preparing a new republican constitution
   for France. Four departments wanted him to represent them: "Aisne,
   Puy-de-Dome, Oise, and the Pas-de-Calais. Calais chose him as the last of
   five deputies, among the first had been a favorite son, Maximilien
   Robespierre, elected unanimously - and it took three ballots to put him
   across."18
    
        Paine served in the Convention, distinguishing himself by being one
   of the few to vote against the execution of Louis XVI and working on a
   committee, along with the Marquis de Condorcet, to draft the constitution
   for the newly established republic It might be reasonable to conclude that
   his service as an elected member of the Convention might have made him
   into a permanent French national, but in fact this never happened because
   he thought of himself as an American. Soon, however, he was arrested and
   incarcerated in the Luxembourg Prison, ironically accused of being an
   English citizen and thus a spy who was a threat to the security of the
   Revolution (as all Englishmen were so regarded). Of course, it is not
   unreasonable to argue that he pleaded that he was not an Englishman simply
   to avoid imprisonment or, worse, execution. Although he had been made a
   "citoyen" by the Assembly and although he worked hard in the Convention,
   writing from prison in 1794 he told Monroe that he "had no more idea than
   [Washington] of vacating any part of my real citizenship of America for a
   nominal one in France, especially at a time when she did not know whether
   she would be a Nation or not." He said that he considered himself a true
   citizen of America because France did not yet have a consciousness of
   itself as a nation. Was this a ploy to convince Monroe to help him be
   released from the Luxembourg? Was he
   hoping that maybe French police authorities would intercept the letter and
   see that he really was loyal to France? It should be recognized that Paine
   never formally renounced his French citizenship. Indeed, he had accepted
   the seat with great relish in the National Convention, and spoke there
   just as if he were a true patriot of France and its Revolution. He even
   told Monroe that while a member of the Convention, he was connected to no
   particular party, "but considered myself a [French] National Man."19 So,
   if he were a "national man," if he served the national interests as a
   whole, was this the same as being a citizen of that nation? Could
   he have considered himself a French national citizen, in short?
    
        Paine himself seemed to be confused in this letter to Monroe. He
   might well have been: after all, he was suffering terribly in prison,
   often quite sick and exhausted. But he went on to say that while he said
   he might have conducted himself as a French national while serving in the
   Convention, he still always thought of himself as an American: "I
   certainly then remained, even upon their own tactics, what I was before, a
   citizen of America."20 Perhaps this is the way to clear up his perceived
   confusion. Paine probably meant that putting aside his predicament of
   languishing in prison, he wished to fulfill his job as a conventioneer as
   well and as best as he could. All along, he kept in mind what he thought
   the new republican nation (France), as a whole ought to be doing, while at
   the same time he believed that he was first, last, and always an American.
   He was never a French national because he would never feel as if he fitted
   into that particular "circle with a common center." He had a specific duty
   to perform in 1792-93, that was all, and that duty was to France, surely,
   but also to his constituency in Pas-de-Calais": I acted only as a friend
   invited among them as I supposed on honorable terms. I did not come to
   join myself to a government already formed, but to assist in forming one
   de nouveau, which was afterwards to be submitted to the people whether
   they would accept it or not, and this any foreigner might do."21
    
        After all, when he finally returned to America in 1802, he wrote that
   he was delighted to be back. America, he said, "is the country of my
   heart." America was "the place of my political and literary birth. It was
   the American Revolution that made me an author, and forced into action the
   mind that had been dormant, and had no wish for public life."22 Paine's
   national consciousness became a final reality to him only after he
   returned to America. He realized only then, after having spent fifteen
   years away from America, that it was in his Philadelphia experiences from
   I774 to 1787 that he truly developed his American national consciousness.
    
        But there was another side to Paine's national consciousness, a side
   that is dissonant with the analysis so far: it is the view expressed by
   Thomas Walker whom I cited at the beginning of this essay and it is a view
   that must be seriously examined in this context. As early as 1782, Paine
   had spoken not a language of nationalism at all but used the vocabulary of
   internationalism. In his "Letter to the Abbe Raynal," for the first time,
   he used this language, which obviated the expression of national
   consciousness that has hitherto been addressed." Here he argued that the
   whole point of human progress was to move not toward the creation of a
   nation of virtue, like America, but to extend and promote what he called
   "universal society, whose mind rises above the atmosphere of local
   thoughts and considers mankind, of whatever nation or profession they may
   be, as the work of one Creator." The world needed a system of extended
   civilization, and he considered himself to be "a universal citizen."24
   Could Paine have made these assertions only to respond to Raynal? This was
   hardly the case because five years later in 1787 he told the Marquis of
   Lansdowne that he was "a man who considers the world as his home."25 A few
   years after that, in Rights of Man, in direct contradiction to his pleas
   to Monroe that he had always been an American, was still an American, and
   in the future he would be too, Paine claimed, "My country is the world."26
   One year later, in defending the life of Louis XVI, he told the National
   Convention that he considered himself "a citizen of the world."27
    
        We might argue that Paine declared himself anAmerican all along for
   convenience alone. First, itwas convenient to be an American when
   hethought he had an opportunity to play a direct role in governmental
   affairs during and just after theAmerican Revolution. He held only one
   federal job, however that of Secretary to the Committee of Foreign
   Affairs, and he was forced to resignfrom that position over the Silas
   Deane affair whenhe accused Deane of war profiteering at the expenseof the
   United Sates. Moreover, Paine wantedto be a member of President
   Washington's cabinet,and he later wanted to serve as the American
   Ministerto France after Jefferson returned to the United States in 1789.
   He had also hoped that Jefferson,as president, would appoint him to some
   position in his administration after Paine returned to America in 1802.28
   At one point, while still inFrance, he even offered his expertise, for
   what it was worth, to Jefferson for him to act as the agentof the United
   States for American goods imported into France.tn Jefferson declined the
   offer. Second,it was convenient for him to say he was an American citizen
   when he wanted to be let out of prisonin 1794. Paine's experience in the
   Luxembourg was not merely uncomfortable. Not only was hequite ill for much
   of the time, but also he undoubtedly feared that he would be executed at
   any moment.It turned out that it was probably only afluke that he escaped
   the guillotine, which he laterattributed to his jailers leaving his prison
   doorclosed with the executioner's mark of death inscribedon the inside,
   not the outside, of the door.30 Paine's sole hope of liberation, he said
   later, would not be on the basis of his past service to France. Rather, he
   knew that it "rested on the government of America, that it would remember
   me."31 Finally, perhaps it was convenient because Paineknew that he could
   never return to England. After an English court had found him guilty of
   seditious libel and declared him an outlaw as a result of the successful
   prosecution against him for writing and
   publishing the second part of Rights of Man, he was afraid that he would
   be jailed, even hanged, should he ever try to return to England. If he
   wished to leave France, which was something he often spoke about doing
   after his release from the Luxembourg in 1794, he had only America to turn
   to for a homeland.
    
        But to assert that Paine was an American as a matter of convenience
   does not do justice to his newly formed national consciousness. In deed,
   throughout his Parisian correspondence, Paine often spoke of his desire to
   return to America: "I am always intending to return to America," he wrote
   in 1797; he later told Madison that he intended "to have set off for
   America," but he didn't like the ship's captain; "my intention is to
   return to America as soon as I can cross the sea in safety," he wrote in
   1798; and he told Jefferson in 1800 that "if any American frigate should
   come to France . . . I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of
   returning."32 Paine was now afraid to leave, fearing that at the moment he
   set sail, the English navy would pick him up on the high seas, return him
   to London for jail or execution. On the other hand, it may well have been
   that Paine was at once conscious of the contradictions that might have
   inherently existed in his American nationality and his internationalism.
   At heart, as he himself testified more than once, he was an American after
   1776, but intellectually at least after 1782 an internationalist until his
   post-French revolutionary encounter with France. Writing from that country
   just before the Revolution broke out in 1789, he said, "my heart and
   myself are 3000 miles apart; and I had rather see my horse Button in his
   own stable, or eating the grass of Bordentown or Morrisania, than see all
   the pomp and show of Europe."33 In the end, the two positions - his
   American nationality and his internationalist outlook - were not
   incompatible. He brought them together in a manner, which allowed him at
   once to say that while he was consciously an American, his mind was always
   on the world in its entirety. As he himself put it in 1787, "I defend the
   cause of humanittl."34 Thus, Paine's American consciousness was always
   just that: purely American after the break with England in 1776, thanks to
   his Philadelphia years, and while he himself might not have fully realized
   this until twenty years later, it would remain so until his death, giving
   a renewed impetus to the development of what it meant to be an American.
