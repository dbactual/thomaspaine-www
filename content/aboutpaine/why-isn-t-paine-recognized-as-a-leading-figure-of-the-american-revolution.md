   Like most topics in American history, there are two camps of historians.
   One group, which has emerged since the 1960's, recognizes Paine as the
   preeminent Founder. As the 200 years of institutional neglect of Paine has
   lost its hold on scholarship, many historians and authors are correcting
   the record and bringing Paine to the forefront. However a large,
   established group of historians, in the old mold of idolizing the
   Federalists at the expense of the democratic wing of the Revolution, still
   hold sway over much of historical analysis. One reason for this is the
   repetition of faulty historicity from early biographies of Paine,
   biographies that were written by political enemies of Paine, and by paid
   agents of the British royalty. Modern biographies still reflect the "false
   facts" from those early misinformation campaigns. Most accounts of the
   Revolution minimize Paine's crucial role, something our Association hopes
   to correct.
