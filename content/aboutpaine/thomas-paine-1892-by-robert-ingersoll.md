                                  Thomas Paine

                        The Works of Robert G. Ingersoll
                          New Dresden Edition, XI, 321

            "A great man's memory may outlive his life half a year,
                 But, by'r lady, he must build churches then."

   EIGHTY-THREE years ago Thomas Paine ceased to defend himself. The moment
   he became dumb all his enemies found a tongue. He was attacked on every
   hand. The Tories of England had been waiting for their revenge. The
   believers in kings, in hereditary government, the nobility of every land,
   execrated his memory. Their greatest enemy was dead. The believers in
   human slavery, and all who clamored for the rights of the States as
   against the sovereignty of a Nation, joined in the chorus of denunciation.
   In addition to this, the believers in the inspiration of the Scriptures,
   the occupants of orthodox pulpits, the professors in Christian colleges,
   and the religious historians, were his sworn and implacable foes.

   This man had gratified no ambition at the expense of his fellow-men; he
   had desolated no country with the flame and sword of war; he had not wrung
   millions from the poor and unfortunate; he had betrayed no trust, and yet
   he was almost universally despised. He gave his life for the benefit of
   mankind. Day and night for many, many weary years, he labored for the good
   of others, and gave himself body and soul to the great cause of human
   liberty. And yet he won the hatred of the people for whose benefit, for
   whose emancipation, for whose civilization, for whose exaltation he gave
   his life.

   Against him every slander that malignity could coin and hypocrisy pass was
   gladly and joyously taken as genuine, and every truth with regard to his
   career was believed to be counterfeit. He was attacked by thousands where
   he was defended by one, and the one who defended him was instantly
   attacked, silenced, or destroyed.

   At last his life has been written by Moncure D. Conway and the real
   history of Thomas Paine, of what he attempted and accomplished, of what he
   taught and suffered, has been intelligently, truthfully and candidly given
   to the world. Henceforth the slanderer will be without excuse.

   He who reads Mr. Conway's pages will find that Thomas Paine was more than
   a patriot -- that he was a philanthropist -- a lover not only of his
   country, but of all mankind. He will find that his sympathies were with
   those who suffered, without regard to religion or race, country or
   complexion. He will find that this great man did not hesitate to attack
   the governing class of his native land -- to commit what was called
   treason against the king, that he might do battle for the rights of men;
   that in spite of the prejudices of birth, he took the side of the American
   Colonies; that he gladly attacked the political abuses and absurdities
   that had been fostered by altars and thrones for many centuries; that he
   was for the people against nobles and kings, and that he put his life in
   pawn for the good of others.

   In the winter of 1774, Thomas Paine came to America. After a time he was
   employed as one of the writers on the Pennsylvania Magazine.

   Let us see what he did, calculated to excite the hatred of his fellow-men.

   The first article he ever wrote in America, and the first ever published
   by him anywhere, appeared in that magazine on the 8th of March, 1775. It
   was an attack on American slavery -- a plea for the rights of the negro.
   In that article will be found substantially all the arguments that can be
   urged against that most infamous of all institutions. Every line is full
   of humanity, pity, tenderness, and love of justice. Five days after this
   article appeared the American Anti-Slavery Society was formed. Certainly
   this should not excite our hatred. To-day the civilized world agrees with
   the essay written by Thomas Paine in 1775.

   At that time great interests were against him. The owners of slaves became
   his enemies, and the pulpits, supported by slave labor, denounced this
   abolitionist.

   The next article published by Thomas Paine, in the same magazine, and for
   the next month, was an attack on the practice of dueling, showing that it
   was barbarous, that it did not even tend to settle the right or wrong of a
   dispute, that it could not be defended on any just grounds, and that its
   influence was degrading and cruel. The civilized world now agrees with the
   opinions of Thomas Paine upon that barbarous practice.

   In May, 1775, appeared in the same magazine another article written by
   Thomas Paine, a Protest Against Cruelty to Animals. He began the work that
   was so successfully and gloriously carried out by Henry Bergh, one of the
   noblest, one of the grandest, men that this continent has produced.

   The good people of this world agree with Thomas Paine.

   In August of the same year he wrote a plea for the Rights of Woman, the
   first ever published in the New World. Certainly he should not be hated
   for that.

   He was the first to suggest a union of the colonies. Before the
   Declaration of Independence was issued, Paine had written of and about the
   Free and Independent States of America. He had also spoken of the United
   Colonies as the "Glorious Union," and he was the first to write these
   words: "The United States of America."

   In May, 1775, Washington said: "If you ever hear of me joining in any such
   measure (as separation from Great Britain) you have my leave to set me
   down for everything wicked." He had also said: "It is not the wish or
   interest of the government (meaning Massachusetts), or of any other upon
   this continent, separately or collectively, to set up for independence."
   And in the same year Benjamin Franklin assured Chatham that no one in
   America was in favor of separation. As a matter of fact, the people of the
   colonies wanted a redress of their grievances -- they were not dreaming of
   separation, of independence.

   In 1775 Paine wrote the pamphlet known as "Common Sense." This was
   published on the 10th of January, 1776. It was the first appeal for
   independence, the first cry for national life, for absolute separation. No
   pamphlet, no book, ever kindled such a sudden conflagration, -- a
   purifying flame, in which the prejudices and fears of millions were
   consumed. To read it now, after the lapse of more than a hundred years,
   hastens the blood. It is but the meager truth to say that Thomas Paine did
   more for the cause of separation, to sow the seeds of independence, than
   any other man of his time. Certainly we should not despise him for this.
   The Declaration of Independence followed, and in that declaration will be
   found not only the thoughts, but some of the expressions of Thomas Paine.

   During the war, and in the very darkest hours, Paine wrote what is called
   "The Crisis," a series of pamphlets giving from time to time his opinion
   of events, and his prophecies. These marvelous publications produced an
   effect nearly as great as the pamphlet "Common Sense." These strophes,
   written by the bivouac fires, had in them the soul of battle.

   In all he wrote, Paine was direct and natural. He touched the very heart
   of the subject. He was not awed by names or titles, by place or power. He
   never lost his regard for truth, for principle -- never wavered in his
   allegiance to reason, to what he believed to be right. His arguments were
   so lucid, so unanswerable, his comparisons and analogies so apt, so
   unexpected, that they excited the passionate admiration of friends and the
   unquenchable hatred of enemies. So great were these appeals to patriotism,
   to the love of liberty, the pride of independence, the glory of success,
   that it was said by some of the best and greatest of that time that the
   American cause owed as much to the pen of Paine as to the sword of
   Washington.

   On the 2d day of November, 1779, there was introduced into the Assembly of
   Pennsylvania an act for the abolition of slavery. The preamble was written
   by Thomas Paine. To him belongs the honor and glory of having written the
   first Proclamation of Emancipation in America -- Paine the first, Lincoln
   the last.

   Paine, of all others, succeeded in getting aid for the struggling colonies
   from France. "According to Lamartine, the King, Louis XVI., loaded Paine
   with favors, and a gift of six millions was confided into the hands of
   Franklin and Paine. On the 25th of August, 1781, Paine reached Boston
   bringing two million five hundred thousand livres in silver, and in convoy
   a ship laden with clothing and military stores."

   "In November, 1779, Paine was elected clerk to the General Assembly of
   Pennsylvania. In 1780, the Assembly received a letter from General
   Washington in the field, saying that he feared the distresses in the army
   would lead to mutiny in the ranks. This letter was read by Paine to the
   Assembly. He immediately wrote to Blair McClenaghan, a Philadelphia
   merchant, explaining the urgency, and inclosing five hundred dollars, the
   amount of salary due him as clerk, as his contribution towards a relief
   fund. The merchant called a meeting the next day, and read Paine's letter.
   A subscription list was immediately circulated, and in a short time about
   one million five hundred thousand dollars was raised. With this capital
   the Pennsylvania bank -- afterwards the bank of North America -- was
   established for the relief of the army."

   In 1783 "Paine wrote a memorial to Chancellor Livingston, Secretary of
   Foreign Affairs, Robert Morris, Minister of Finance, and his assistant,
   urging the necessity of adding a Continental Legislature to Congress, to
   be elected by the several States. Robert Morris invited the Chancellor and
   a number of eminent men to meet Paine at dinner, where his plea for a
   stronger Union was discussed and approved. This was probably the earliest
   of a series of consultations preliminary to the Constitutional
   Convention."

   "On the 19th of April, 1783, it being the eighth anniversary of the Battle
   of Lexington, Paine printed a little pamphlet entitled 'Thoughts on Peace
   and the Probable Advantages Thereof.'" In this pamphlet he pleads for "a
   supreme Nationality absorbing all cherished sovereignties." Mr. Conway
   calls this pamphlet Paine's "Farewell Address," and gives the following
   extract:

   "It was the cause of America that made me an author. The force with which
   it struck my mind, and the dangerous condition in which the country was
   in, by courting an impossible and an unnatural reconciliation with those
   who were determined to reduce her, instead of striking out into the only
   line that could save her, -- a Declaration of Independence, -- made it
   impossible for me, feeling as I did, to be silent; and if, in the course
   of more than seven years, I have rendered her any service, I have likewise
   added something to the reputation of literature, by freely and
   disinterestedly employing it in the great cause of mankind.... But as the
   scenes of war are closed, and every man preparing for home and happier
   times, I therefore take leave of the subject. I have most sincerely
   followed it from beginning to end, and through all its turns and windings;
   and whatever country I may hereafter be in, I shall always feel an honest
   pride at the part I have taken and acted, and a gratitude to nature and
   providence for putting it in my power to be of some use to mankind."

   Paine had made some enemies, first, by attacking African slavery, and,
   second, by insisting upon the sovereignty of the Nation.

   During the Revolution our forefathers, in order to justify making war on
   Great Britain, were compelled to take the ground that all men are entitled
   to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In no other way could they
   justify their action. After the war, the meaner instincts began to take
   possession of the mind, and those who had fought for their own liberty
   were perfectly willing to enslave others. We must also remember that the
   Revolution was begun and carried on by a noble minority -- that the
   majority were really in favor of Great Britain and did what they dared to
   prevent the success of the American cause. The minority, however, had
   control of affairs. They were active, energetic, enthusiastic, and
   courageous, and the majority were overawed, shamed, and suppressed. But
   when peace came, the majority asserted themselves and the interests of
   trade and commerce were consulted. Enthusiasm slowly died, and patriotism
   was mingled with the selfishness of traffic.

   But, after all, the enemies of Paine were few, the friends were many. He
   had the respect and admiration of the greatest and the best, and was
   enjoying the fruits of his labor.

   The Revolution was ended, the colonies were free. They had been united,
   they formed a Nation, and the United States of America had a place on the
   map of the world.

   Paine was not a politician. He had not labored for seven years to get an
   office. His services were no longer needed in America. He concluded to
   educate the English people, to inform them of their rights, to expose the
   pretenses, follies and fallacies, the crimes and cruelties of nobles,
   kings, and parliaments. In the brain and heart of this man were the dream
   and hope of the universal republic. He had confidence in the people. He
   hated tyranny and war, despised the senseless pomp and vain show of
   crowned robbers, laughed at titles, and the "honorable" badges worn by the
   obsequious and servile, by fawners and followers; loved liberty with all
   his heart, and bravely fought against those who could give the rewards of
   place and gold, and for those who could pay only with thanks.

   Hoping to hasten the day of freedom, he wrote the "Rights of Man" -- a
   book that laid the foundation for all the real liberty that the English
   now enjoy -- a book that made known to Englishmen the Declaration of
   Nature, and convinced millions that all are children of the same mother,
   entitled to share equally in her gifts. Every Englishman who has outgrown
   the ideas of 1688 should remember Paine with love and reverence. Every
   Englishman who has sought to destroy abuses, to lessen or limit the
   prerogatives of the crown, to extend the suffrage, to do away with "rotten
   boroughs," to take taxes from knowledge, to increase and protect the
   freedom of speech and the press, to do away with bribes under the name of
   pensions, and to make England a government of principles rather than of
   persons, has been compelled to adopt the creed and use the arguments of
   Thomas Paine. In England every step toward freedom has been a triumph of
   Paine over Burke and Pitt. No man ever rendered a greater service to his
   native land.

   The book called the "Rights of Man" was the greatest contribution that
   literature had given to liberty. It rests on the bed-rock. No attention is
   paid to precedents except to show that they are wrong. Paine was not
   misled by the proverbs that wolves had written for sheep. He had the
   intelligence to examine for himself, and the courage to publish his
   conclusions. As soon as the "Rights of Man" was published the Government
   was alarmed. Every effort was made to suppress it. The author was
   indicted; those who published, and those who sold, were arrested and
   imprisoned. But the new gospel had been preached -- a great man had shed
   light -- a new force had been born, and it was beyond the power of nobles
   and kings to undo what the author-hero had done.

   To avoid arrest and probable death, Paine left England. He had sown with
   brave hand the seeds of thought, and he knew that he had lighted a fire
   that nothing could extinguish until England should be free.

   The fame of Thomas Paine had reached France in many ways -- principally
   through Lafayette. His services in America were well known. The pamphlet
   "Common Sense" had been published in French, and its effect had been
   immense. "The Rights of Man" that had created, and was then creating, such
   a stir in England, was also known to the French. The lovers of liberty
   everywhere were the friends and admirers of Thomas Paine. In America,
   England, Scotland, Ireland, and France he was known as the defender of
   popular rights. He had preached a new gospel. He had given a new Magna
   Charta to the people.

   So popular was Paine in France that he was elected by three constituencies
   to the National Convention. He chose to represent Calais. From the moment
   he entered French territory he was received with almost royal honors. He
   at once stood with the foremost, and was welcomed by all enlightened
   patriots. As in America, so in France, he knew no idleness -- he was an
   organizer and worker. The first thing he did was to found the first
   Republican Society, and the next to write its Manifesto, in which the
   ground was taken that France did not need a king; that the people should
   govern themselves. In this Manifesto was this argument:

   "What kind of office must that be in a government which requires neither
   experience nor ability to execute? that may be abandoned to the desperate
   chance of birth; that may be filled with an idiot, a madman, a tyrant,
   with equal effect as with the good, the virtuous, the wise? An office of
   this nature is a mere nonentity; it is a place of show, not of use."

   He said:

   "I am not the personal enemy of kings. Quite the contrary. No man wishes
   more heartily than myself to see them all in the happy and honorable state
   of private individuals; but I am the avowed, open and intrepid enemy of
   what is called monarchy; and I am such by principles which nothing can
   either alter or corrupt, by my attachment to humanity, by the anxiety
   which I feel within myself for the dignity and honor of the human race."

   One of the grandest things done by Thomas Paine was his effort to save the
   life of Louis XVI. The Convention was in favor of death. Paine was a
   foreigner. His career had caused some jealousies. He knew the danger he
   was in -- that the tiger was already crouching for a spring -- but he was
   true to his principles. He was opposed to the death penalty. He remembered
   that Louis XVI. had been the friend of America, and he very cheerfully
   risked his life, not only for the good of France, not only to save the
   king, but to pay a debt of gratitude. He asked the Convention to exile the
   king to the United States. He asked this as a member of the Convention and
   as a citizen of the United States. As an American he felt grateful not
   only to the king, but to every Frenchman. He, the adversary of all kings,
   asked the Convention to remember that kings were men, and subject to human
   frailties. He took still another step, and said: "As France has been the
   first of European nations to abolish royalty, let us also be the first to
   abolish the punishment of death."

   Even after the death of Louis had been voted, Paine made another appeal.
   With a courage born of the highest possible sense of duty he said:

   "France has but one ally -- the United States of America. That is the only
   nation that can furnish France with naval provisions, for the kingdoms of
   Northern Europe are, or soon will be, at war with her. It happens that the
   person now under discussion is regarded in America as a deliverer of their
   country. I can assure you that his execution will there spread universal
   sorrow, and it is in your power not thus to wound the feelings of your
   ally. Could I speak the French language I would descend to your bar, and
   in their name become your petitioner to respite the execution of your
   sentence on Louis. Ah, citizens, give not the tyrant of England the
   triumph of seeing the man perish on the scaffold who helped my dear
   brothers of America to break his chains."

   This was worthy of the man who had said: "Where Liberty is not, there is
   my country."

   Paine was second on the committee to prepare the draft of a constitution
   for France to be submitted to the Convention. He was the real author, not
   only of the draft of the Constitution, but of the Declaration of Rights.

   In France, as in America, he took the lead. His first thoughts seemed to
   be first principles. He was clear because he was profound. People without
   ideas experience great difficulty in finding words to express them.

   From the moment that Paine cast his vote in favor of mercy -- in favor of
   life -- the shadow of the guillotine was upon him. He knew that when he
   voted for the King's life, he voted for his own death. Paine remembered
   that the king had been the friend of America, and to him ingratitude
   seemed the worst of crimes. He worked to destroy the monarch, not the man;
   the king, not the friend. He discharged his duty and accepted death. This
   was the heroism of goodness -- the sublimity of devotion.

   Believing that his life was near its close, he made up his mind to give to
   the world his thoughts concerning "revealed religion." This he had for
   some time intended to do, but other matters had claimed his attention.
   Feeling that there was no time to be lost, he wrote the first part of the
   "Age of Reason," and gave the manuscript to Joel Barlow. Six hours after,
   he was arrested. The second part was written in prison while he was
   waiting for death.

   Paine clearly saw that men could not be really free, or defend the freedom
   they had, unless they were free to think and speak. He knew that the
   church was the enemy of liberty, that the altar and throne were in
   partnership, that they helped each other and divided the spoils.

   He felt that, being a man, he had the right to examine the creeds and the
   Scriptures for himself, and that, being an honest man, it was his duty and
   his privilege to tell his fellow-men the conclusions at which he arrived.

   He found that the creeds of all orthodox churches were absurd and cruel,
   and that the Bible was no better. Of course he found that there were some
   good things in the creeds and in the Bible. These he defended, but the
   infamous, the inhuman, he attacked.

   In matters of religion he pursued the same course that he had in things
   political. He depended upon experience, and above all on reason. He
   refused to extinguish the light in his own soul. He was true to himself,
   and gave to others his honest thoughts. He did not seek wealth, or place,
   or fame. He sought the truth.

   He had felt it to be his duty to attack the institution of slavery in
   America, to raise his voice against dueling, to plead for the rights of
   woman, to excite pity for the sufferings of domestic animals, the
   speechless friends of man; to plead the cause of separation, of
   independence, of American nationality, to attack the abuses and crimes of
   monarchs to do what he could to give freedom to the world.

   He thought it his duty to take another step. Kings asserted that they
   derived their power, their right to govern, from God. To this assertion
   Paine replied with the "Rights of Man." Priests pretended that they were
   the authorized agents of God. Paine replied with the "Age of Reason."

   This book is still a power, and will be as long as the absurdities and
   cruelties of the creeds and the Bible have defenders. The "Age of Reason"
   affected the priests just as the "Rights of Man" affected nobles and
   kings. The kings answered the arguments of Paine with laws, the priests
   with lies. Kings appealed to force, priests to fraud. Mr. Conway has
   written in regard to the "Age of Reason" the most impressive and the most
   interesting chapter in his book.

   Paine contended for the rights of the individual, -- for the jurisdiction
   of the soul. Above all religions he placed Reason, above all kings, Men,
   and above all men Law.

   The first part of the "Age of Reason" was written in the shadow of a
   prison, the second part in the gloom of death. From that shadow, from that
   gloom, came a flood of light. This testament, by which the wealth of a
   marvelous brain, the love of a great and heroic heart were given to the
   world, was written in the presence of the scaffold, when the writer
   believed he was giving his last message to his fellow-men.

   The "Age of Reason" was his crime.

   Franklin, Jefferson, Sumner and Lincoln, the four greatest statesmen that
   America has produced, were believers in the creed of Thomas Paine.

   The Universalists and Unitarians have found their best weapons, their best
   arguments, in the "Age of Reason."

   Slowly, but surely, the churches are adopting not only the arguments, but
   the opinions of the great Reformer.

   Theodore Parker attacked the Old Testament and Calvinistic theology with
   the same weapons and with a bitterness excelled by no man who has
   expressed his thoughts in our language.

   Paine was a century in advance of his time. If he were living now his
   sympathy would be with Savage, Chadwick, Professor Briggs and the
   "advanced theologians." He, too, would talk about the "higher criticism,"
   and the latest definition of "inspiration." These advanced thinkers
   substantially are repeating the "Age of Reason." They still wear the old
   uniform -- clinging to the toggery of theology -- but inside of their
   religious rags they agree with Thomas Paine.

   Not one argument that Paine urged against the inspiration of the Bible,
   against the truth of miracles, against the barbarities and infamies of the
   Old Testament, against the pretensions of priests and the claims of kings,
   has ever been answered.

   His arguments in favor of the existence of what he was pleased to call the
   God of Nature were as weak as those of all Theists have been. But in all
   the affairs of this world, his clearness of vision, lucidity of
   expression, cogency of argument, aptness of comparison, power of statement
   and comprehension of the subject in hand, with all its bearings and
   consequences, have rarely, if ever, bean excelled.

   He had no reverence for mistakes because they were old. He did not admire
   the castles of Feudalism even when they were covered with ivy. He not only
   said that the Bible was not inspired, but he demonstrated that it could
   not all be true. This was "brutal." He presented arguments so strong, so
   clear, so convincing, that they could not be answered. This was "vulgar."

   He stood for liberty against kings, for humanity against creeds and gods.
   This was "cowardly and low." He gave his life to free and civilize his
   fellow-men. This was "infamous."

   Paine was arrested and imprisoned in December, 1793. He was, to say the
   least, neglected by Gouverneur Morris and Washington. He was released
   through the efforts of James Monroe, in November, 1794. He was called back
   to the Convention, but too late to be of use. As most of the actors had
   suffered death, the tragedy was about over and the curtain was falling.
   Paine remained in Paris until the "Reign of Terror" was ended and that of
   the Corsican tyrant had commenced.

   Paine came back to America hoping to spend the remainder of his life
   surrounded by those for whose happiness and freedom he had labored so many
   years. He expected to be rewarded with the love and reverence of the
   American people.

   In 1794 James Monroe had written to Paine these words:

   "It is unnecessary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I
   speak of the great mass of the people, are interested in your welfare.
   They have not forgot the history of their own Revolution and the difficult
   scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its several stages
   without reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the merits of those
   who served them in that great and arduous conflict. The crime of
   ingratitude has not yet stained, and I hope never will stain, our national
   character. You are considered by them as not only having rendered
   important services in our own Revolution, but as being on a more extensive
   scale the friend of human rights and a distinguished and able advocate of
   public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas Paine we are not and cannot be
   indifferent."

   In the same year Mr. Monroe wrote a letter to the Committee of General
   Safety, asking for the release of Mr. Paine, in which, among other things,
   he said:

   "The services Thomas Paine rendered to his country in its struggle for
   freedom have implanted in the hearts of his countrymen a sense of
   gratitude never to be effaced as long as they shall deserve the title of a
   just and generous people."

   On reaching America, Paine found that the sense of gratitude had been
   effaced. He found that the Federalists hated him with all their hearts
   because he believed in the rights of the people and was still true to the
   splendid principles advocated during the darkest days of the Revolution.
   In almost every pulpit he found a malignant and implacable foe, and the
   pews were filled with his enemies. The slave-holders hated him. He was
   held responsible even for the crimes of the French Revolution. He was
   regarded as a blasphemer, an Atheist, an enemy of God and man. The
   ignorant citizens of Bordentown, as cowardly as orthodox, longed to mob
   the author of "Common Sense" and "The Crisis." They thought he had sold
   himself to the Devil because he had defended God against the slanderous
   charges that he had inspired the writers of the Bible -- because he had
   said that a being of infinite goodness and purity did not establish
   slavery and polygamy.

   Paine had insisted that men had the right to think for themselves. This so
   enraged the average American citizen that he longed for revenge.

   In 1802 the people of the United states had exceedingly crude ideas about
   the liberty of thought and expression. Neither had they any conception of
   religious freedom. Their highest thought on that subject was expressed by
   the word "toleration," and even this toleration extended only to the
   various Christian sects. Even the vaunted religious liberty of colonial
   Maryland was only to the effect that one kind of Christian should not
   fine, imprison and kill another kind of Christian, but all kinds of
   Christians had the right, and it was their duty, to brand, imprison and
   kill Infidels of every kind.

   Paine had been guilty of thinking for himself and giving his conclusions
   to the world without having asked the consent of a priest -- just as he
   had published his political opinions without leave of the king. He had
   published his thoughts on religion and had appealed to reason -- to the
   light in every mind, to the humanity, the pity, the goodness which he
   believed to be in every heart. He denied the right of kings to make laws
   and of priests to make creeds. He insisted that the people should make
   laws, and that every human being should think for himself. While some
   believed in the freedom of religion, he believed in the religion of
   freedom.

   If Paine had been a hypocrite, if he had concealed his opinions, if he had
   defended slavery with quotations from the "sacred Scriptures" -- if he had
   cared nothing for the liberties of men in other lands -- if he had said
   that the state could not live without the church -- if he had sought for
   place instead of truth, he would have won wealth and power, and his brow
   would have been crowned with the laurel of fame.

   He made what the pious call the "mistake" of being true to himself -- of
   living with an unstained soul. He had lived and labored for the people.
   The people were untrue to him. They returned evil for good, hatred for
   benefits received, and yet this great chivalric soul remembered their
   ignorance and loved them with all his heart, and fought their oppressors
   with all his strength.

   We must remember what the churches and creeds were in that day, what the
   theologians really taught, and what the people believed. To save a few in
   spite of their vices, and to damn the many without regard to their
   virtues, and all for the glory of the Damner: -- this was Calvinism. "He
   that hath ears to hear, let him hear," but he that hath a brain to think
   must not think. He that believeth without evidence is good, and he that
   believeth in spite of evidence is a saint. Only the wicked doubt, only the
   blasphemer denies. This was orthodox Christianity.

   Thomas Paine had the courage, the sense, the heart, to denounce these
   horrors, these absurdities, these infinite infamies. He did what he could
   to drive these theological wipers, these Calvinistic cobras, these fanged
   and hissing serpents of superstition from the heart of man.

   A few civilized men agreed with him then, and the world has progressed
   since 1809. Intellectual wealth has accumulated; vast mental estates have
   been left to the world. Geologists have forced secrets from the rocks,
   astronomers from the stars, historians from old records and lost
   languages. In every direction the thinker and the investigator have
   ventured and explored, and even the pews have begun to ask questions of
   the pulpits. Humboldt has lived, and Darwin and Haeckel and Huxley, and
   the armies led by them, have changed the thought of the world.

   The churches of 1809 could not be the friends of Thomas Paine. No church
   asserting that belief is necessary to salvation ever was, or ever will be,
   the champion of true liberty. A church founded on slavery -- that is to
   say, on blind obedience, worshiping irresponsible and arbitrary power,
   must of necessity be the enemy of human freedom.

   The orthodox churches are now anxious to save the little that Paine left
   of their creed. If one now believes in God, and lends a little financial
   aid, he is considered a good and desirable member. He need not define God
   after the manner of the catechism. He may talk about a "Power that works
   for righteousness," or the tortoise Truth that beats the rabbit Lie in the
   long run, or the "Unknowable," or the "Unconditioned," or the "Cosmic
   Force," or the "Ultimate Atom," or "Protoplasm," or the "What" -- provided
   he begins this word with a capital.

   We must also remember that there is a difference between independence and
   liberty. Millions have fought for independence -- to throw off some
   foreign yoke -- and yet were at heart the enemies of true liberty. A man
   in jail, sighing to be free, may be said to be in favor of liberty, but
   not from principle; but a man who, being free, risks or gives his life to
   free the enslaved, is a true soldier of liberty.

   Thomas Paine had passed the legendary limit of life. One by one most of
   his old friends and acquaintances had deserted him. Maligned on every
   side, execrated, shunned and abhorred -- his virtues denounced as vices --
   his services forgotten -- his character blackened, he preserved the poise
   and balance of his soul. He was a victim of the people, but his
   convictions remained unshaken. He was still a soldier in the army of
   freedom, and still tried to enlighten and civilize those who were
   impatiently waiting for his death. Even those who loved their enemies
   hated him, their friend -- the friend of the whole world -- with all their
   hearts.

   On the 8th of June, 1809, death came -- Death, almost his only friend.

   At his funeral no pomp, no pageantry, no civic procession, no military
   display. In a carriage, a woman and her son who had lived on the bounty of
   the dead -- on horseback, a Quaker, the humanity of whose heart dominated
   the creed of his head -- and, following on foot, two negroes filled with
   gratitude -- constituted the funeral cortege of Thomas Paine.

   He who had received the gratitude of many millions, the thanks of generals
   and statesmen -- he who had been the friend and companion of the wisest
   and best -- he who had taught a people to be free, and whose words had
   inspired armies and enlightened nations, was thus given back to Nature,
   the mother of us all.

   If the people of the great Republic knew the life of this generous, this
   chivalric man, the real story of his services, his sufferings and his
   triumphs of what he did to compel the robed and crowned, the priests and
   kings, to give back to the people liberty, the jewel of the soul; if they
   knew that he was the first to write, "The Religion of Humanity"; if they
   knew that he, above all others, planted and watered the seeds of
   independence, of union, of nationality, in the hearts of our forefathers
   -- that his words were gladly repeated by the best and bravest in many
   lands; if they knew that he attempted, by the purest means, to attain the
   noblest and loftiest ends -- that he was original, sincere, intrepid, and
   that he could truthfully say: "The world is my country, to do good my
   religion" -- if the people only knew all this -- the truth -- they would
   repeat the words of Andrew Jackson: "Thomas Paine needs no monument made
   with hands; he has erected a monument in the hearts of all lovers of
   liberty."
