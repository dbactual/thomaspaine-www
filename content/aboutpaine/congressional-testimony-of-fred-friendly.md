                Before the National Capital Memorial Commission

                                 April 12, 1994

    

        I am a journalist and have been one for about as long as I can
   remember. I have received a number of awards throughout my career, but I
   must say that few have pleased me as much or have meant as much to me as
   the Award I received on January 31, 1991 from The Thomas Paine National
   Historical Association. After a lifetime of work in my profession, there
   is no one I feel a greater kinship with than Thomas Paine.
        I am told that the issue before you today is whether or not Thomas
   Paine was a preeminent American and thus deserving of being memorialized
   in the Area One section of this city.
        Thomas Paine was not just one of many important contributors to the
   success of the American Revolution. Rather, it is m opinion, that he
   stands as one of the pillars, along with men like Washington and
   Jefferson, of the extraordinary edifice which was built over 200 years
   ago. Take away any one of those pillars, and this country as we know it
   today would have been different, and I think not nearly so great.
        Let me spend just a moment supporting my view of Paine's importance,
   particularly to the First Amendment.
        When I was honored by the Thomas Paine Association, I received a
   medal and I understand that Mr. Cooper has brought one of them to show you
   today. On that medal are the words written by Thomas Paine "When opinions
   are free, truth will prevail". That is almost the invention of the First
   Amendment. And that remark was echoed by a Supreme Court Justice whom I
   admire, Lewis Powell. Justice Powell in the famous Gertz case (Gertz v.
   Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 337, 339-340 (1974)) said "However pernicious
   an opinion may seem, we depend on its correction . . . on the competition
   of other ideas." Isn't that amazing. The content of the Supreme Court of
   the United States and Tom Paine are in all substantive respects
   identical. Justice Powell also stated that, "Under the First Amendment
   there is no such thing as a false idea." If that is true, and I believe it
   is, then Tom Paine was in many ways the first American. Our Constitution
   comes right out of his ribs.
        The First Amendment, which I carry in my pocket, has its very origins
   with Tom Paine, who was more worried about government than he was about
   our enemy, the British. He believed that first we had to protect the
   Country, then we had to protect the people from the Country. That is what
   our Bill of Rights was and is all about. In Common Sense Tom Paine wrote:
   "Now, [1776], is the seed time of continental union, faith and honor. The
   least fracture now will be like a name engraved with the point of a pin on
   the tender rind of a young oak. The wound will enlarge with the tree, and
   posterity read it in full grown characters." On that imprint on the
   liberty tree are Tom Paine's initials. And as our tree of liberty grew
   from a little sapling to the great mighty oak it is today, it grew with
   the impression that Tom Paine had sketched on it there when the Country
   was being born.
         When our Constitution was written, James Madison sent a copy of it
   to Thomas Jefferson who was then in France as our Ambassador. Jefferson
   sent it back with almost a rejection note to Madison. In essence, he said,
   "It is all right as far as it goes. What I do not like in your
   Constitution is the omission of a Bill of Rights, which is what the people
   are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular,
   and that which no just government should refuse." That is what Tom Paine
   had been saying for 15 years. Madison wrote back to Jefferson and he said,
   essentially, "My dear Thomas, if we tried to put the Bill of Rights in the
   Constitution, we would never get it ratified. There would be too many
   states that would vote against it." Alexander Hamilton was very much
   against it. John Adams was against it. But, he continued, "I make you a
   promise. At the First Congress which will meet in one year, we will come
   back and we will have a Bill of Rights and we will get it ratified." They
   did come back and the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution. In
   ways the Bill of Rights has more of the sinew of what our country is and
   has become, than the rest of the Constitution. In ways it is the legacy of
   Tom Paine.
        If ever an individual deserved a place of prominence as a preeminent
   American it is Thomas Paine. If we had to point to one person who invented
   the language of the Revolution, it was Thomas Paine. If we had to point to
   one person who convinced the people that they should declare independence,
   it was Thomas Paine. If there was one person who provided the intellectual
   compass by which a new nation "conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
   proposition that all men are created equal" could steer confidently into
   the future, bristling with the arms that the First Amendment provided, it
   was Thomas Paine.
        If he should not be honored, it is hard to imagine who ever should
   be. If he is not a preeminent American, it is impossible to imagine who
   is.
