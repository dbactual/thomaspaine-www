Paine was a staunch abolitionist despite the fact that he never wrote
on the subject. The biographies on Paine are in error when they
attribute "African Slavery in America" and "A Serious Thought" to
Paine, and Paine was not a founding member of the first abolitionist
organization established in Philadelphia in 1775. However Paine always
called for the abolition of slavery in personal corresondence and was
close friends with many of the leading abolitionists of his day. See,
for example, <a

March 16, 1789</a>. Also see <a
