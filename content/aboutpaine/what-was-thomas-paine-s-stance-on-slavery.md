   Three months after landing on American soil, Paine helped form the first
   abolitionist society. He also published an article in the same year, 1775,
   opposing slavery, and fought to have an anti-slavery clause put into the
   Declaration of Independence. He was prevented from attending the
   Constitutional Convention, and later criticized the Constitution for,
   among other things, failing to broaden the concept of equality for all.
