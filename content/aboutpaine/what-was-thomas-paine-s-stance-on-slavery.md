Paine was a staunch abolitionist despite the fact that he seldom wrote
on the subject. The biographies on Paine are in error when they
attribute "African Slavery in America" and "A Serious Thought" to
Paine, and Paine was not a founding member of the first abolitionist
organization established in Philadelphia in 1775. However Paine always
called for the abolition of slavery in personal corresondence and was
close friends with many of the leading abolitionists of his day. Recent discoveries in the research into Paine's undiscovered works has revealed more abolitionist tracts and letters, and the influential pamphlet written in London, "Old Truths and Established Facts", to get the abolitionist Slave Act passed has been confirmed that it was written by Paine and Joseph Priestley.
