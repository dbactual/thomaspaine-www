   No. Although many have tried to make that case (including an
   ex-President of this Association, William van der Weyde), Paine
   believed the government's role should be for promoting the general
   happiness and well-being of the people. In Agrarian Justice and
   Rights of Man he outlined the principles that would become the
   basis of the welfare state, help for the poor, aged, and young. He
   supported taxation of the rich to fund these programs. He also
   fought for a strong central government based on his principles of
   human rights. The phrase "at best, government is a necessary evil"
   is often misinterpreted: only the "evil" part is elaborated, and
   the "necessary" part is given short shrift. Paine's central tenet was to apply Enlightenment principles to government, make government democratic, and use government to make social and even economic changes. Anarchism dismisses and opposes all government.
