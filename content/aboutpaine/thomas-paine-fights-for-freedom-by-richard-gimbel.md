      When Gifford Pinchot, Yale Class of 1889, was Governor of Pennsylvania
   many years ago, he honored me by requesting that I accept an appointment
   to a high position in his administration. Knowing nothing whatsoever about
   politics, I sought a conference with him. l inquired," what makes one
   successful in politics".
        The astute Governor replied, "The main ingredient of success in
   politics is to restrict yourself to endorsing very few worthwhile
   projects. It would be best if you identified yourself with only one." He
   explained, "for, no matter how beneficial a project may be to the general
   community, it nevertheless hurts quite a few persons, sometimes important
   in politics or in finance. If you succumb to espousing every good cause,
   you keep building up the number of your enemies. Soon they reach such
   proportions that you cannot possibly be re-elected, and become generally
   disliked."
        No one illustrates this form of committing political suicide better
   than Thomas Paine. Whether in the Old World, the New World, or the Next
   World, Thomas Paine never hesitated
   a moment to rush in and promote every good cause and expose every
   injustice. As a result, he was hated and despised by almost
   everyone. However he was not the first great man to suffer for doing good.
        More than two centuries ago when Thomas Paine was born in England
   (Thetford, Norfolk), the Old World appeared to him rotten to the core. His
   parents were very poor. His father was by religion a Quaker and by
   profession a staymaker (if any of the females in the audience wear
   foundations they will know what this means). His mother was a strict
   member of the Anglican Church, and constantly argued with his father.
   Paine noted that the only thing his parents agreed
   on was that there was a God.  At-the age of seven he had listened to a
   sermon in which the minister described God Almighty acting like a
   passionate man, killing his son. Paine felt that a man would be hanged who
   did such a thing and could see no reason why a sermon like this should be
   preached. If one did not believe in the religion of the State, it seemed
   easier to leave the country than perpetually to fight prejudice and
   persecution.
        His family could afford only to send him through grammar school, and
   he resented having his education cut off in order to learn the distasteful
   art of staymaking. He excelled in mathematics and science, but was best
   remembered for his skill in political arguments. Local politics were
   crooked; representation in Parliament was a farce. Paine claimed that the
   only right possessed by the poor was the right to obey the law, which the
   rich had written.
        As soon as he was able, he bought a pair of globes and attended
   lectures on astronomy given by Dr. Bevis of the Royal Society. He learned
   how to operate the orrery. As he looked at the Universe he contemplated
   the creator. No man or anything like a man could have created this. He
   kept notes on his religious views. He read constantly, and for relaxation
   wrote poetry. His memory was so good, it was uncanny.
        Hardly married a year, Paine and his wife, Mary Lambert, were
   travelling for work a long distance from home when she suddenly died. Here
   he suffered a humiliation known only to the poor. He had no money, either
   to bring her remains home or give them decent burial. Her grave has  never
   been discovered.
        When he obtained a government job as an exciseman, whose task was
   hunting down smugglers of liquor and tobacco, he found the pay
   insufficient to include care for a horse, which
   was necessary. He organized the excisemen into a union, and wrote a plea
   for an increase in their pay, which he sent to each member of Parliament.
   The result could have been foretold:
   he was dismissed. But Paine learned that little attention was given a
   grievance, unless it could receive wide pub1icity.
        Benjamin Franklin had at this same time been dismissed from his
   position as Postmaster for North America, and the two of them met in
   London at scientific lectures and became friends. Franklin must have been
   favorably impressed by Paine's methods of reasoning, because he sent him
   to America with letters of introduction to his son-in-law Richard Bache, a
   prosperous wine merchant in Philadelphia, and apparently also to his
   natural son William Franklin, then Royal-Governor of New  Jersey. (see
   letter from Paine to Franklin, March 4, 1775.)
         The golden promise of the New World was quickly dissipated when
   Paine found opposite his lodgings in Philadelphia, an odious slave market.
   How could Americans complain of their enslavement by England when they
   kept slaves themselves? The pitiful plight of the Africans
   drove him to compose a powerful article against the practice of slavery.
   This time he gave it to a Philadelphia newspaper (Pennsylvania Journal,
   March 8, 1775). Although anonymous, it attracted Dr. Benjamin Rush enough
   for him to find out the author of such convincing arguments. Possibly it
   is only coincidental that the first association against slavery in America
   was organized in Philadelphia shortly after Paine's article appeared.
   Paine's fight for freedom in the New World had begun.
        A month later he was appalled by the bloodshed in the Battle of
   Lexington (April 19, 1775). This outrage by the British Government called
   for something more than a mere revolt against taxation. Because his
   carefully worked-out arguments were too long for the space that could be
   spared for them in newspapers, Dr. Rush introduced Paine to a fearless
   liberal printer, Robert Bell, who was willing to publish the essay in
   pamphlet form. Entitled Common Sense, its clear
   portrayal of the valid reasons for independence spread like wildfire
   through the colonies. Everyone who was able to read, read it. Its effect
   cannot be overestimated. As a direct result
   the Declaration of Independence was signed, and Paine became famous.
        Paine's fighting went further than merely writing. He enlisted,
   shouldered a musket, and was prepared to give his life for the Cause. He
   marched in the disheartening retreat
   across the Jerseys. General despair seemed to strike all, except Paine: he
   picked up his pen, and on a drumhead by the light of a campfire, wrote the
   first American Crisis: "These are
   the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine
   patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but
   he that stands it now, deserves the love and
   thanks of man and woman." The words, never to be forgotten, provided the
   needed immediate lift, with the result that Washington crossed the
   Delaware and the first American victory at Trenton followed. At each
   subsequent crisis Paine was called on for assistance, and he never failed
   to respond effectively with his pen, thirteen times in all.
        His fiery arguments drove the Tories from positions of influence. He
   smashed profiteers, inflationists and counterfeiters as well. He revealed
   confidential data in order to
   expose crooked dealings of the influential Silas Deane (I am sorry to say,
   Yale, Class of 1758). When George Washington's generalship of the troops
   was under fire, Paine rushed to his defense. When funds were needed to
   clothe and feed the soldiers, Paine founded the first bank in this country
   to accommodate their needs, and later on defended it from every attack.
   Not having Governor Pinchot as his advisor, Paine freely printed his
   opinion on every controversy. Soon he could write  that "the greatest and
   completest revolution the world
   ever knew [had been] gloriously and happily accomplished." Paine's pen had
   contributed as much as Washington's sword. Even his enemies admitted this
   much. His battle for political
   freedom in the New World was a success. He had been elected to the
   American Philosophical Society; the University of Pennsylvania gave him a
   MA degree.
        Paine, approaching fifty years of age, wanted to retire and write a
   history, but was financially in straitened circumstances. To gain wider
   circulation, his patriotic articles had been sold by the hundreds of
   thousands, purposely without any compensation whatsoever coming to the
   author. His friends tried to secure a pension for him, but in his many
   bitter fights he had trod on so many toes that it was only with great
   difficulty that they secured from the State of New York a farm situated in
   New Rochelle; from the State of Pennsylvania, 500 pounds; and from
   Congress, $3,000; only a fraction of what he deserved.  Paine was not
   selected as a delegate to the approaching Constitutional Convention; his
   well-known prejudice against slavery and his conviction that every adult
   should vote, landowner or not, undoubtedly prevented this. Perhaps the
   Civil War might have been avoided had Paine attended the convention. Paine
   used his small pension to invent the first bridge made of iron, but no one
   in America had the courage, to build it. He sought the advice of Franklin,
   who told him to go to Paris and get approval first from the French Academy
   of Science. So, armed again with letters of introduction from Franklin to
   important people in Paris, Paine left the New World for the Old.
        Thomas Jefferson, then our ambassador in France, had much in common
   with Paine and they became close friends. Seeping into the minds of the
   downtrodden masses of the Old
   World was the success of the American Revolution. Could Paine's dream of a
   world revolution become an actuality? Revolution in Paine's mind meant
   solely a change from hereditary
   government to a representative democratic system, with universal suffrage
   and protection for the rights of the little people who own no land. A
   bloodless revolution - the kind
   that is usually given the name "reform" - would be ideal.
        While he was in Paris the treacherous flight of Louis XVI, King of
   France, took place. Louis wanted to reach armed allies, with whom he hoped
   to reconquer France and restore himself as absolute monarch. Paine had
   expected the populace to dance in the streets with joy at the
   disappearance of the King. He felt that this was "good riddance to bad
   rubbish," and could hardly believe they were so anxious for the King's
   return that they were actually pursuing him. Just
   as Paine had been the very first to spark the fight for freedom in
   America, now he was the first to spark freedom for France. He daringly
   printed a Manifesto, demanding an immediate republic, and posted it all
   over the city of Paris (July l, 179I). Like the Theses of Martin Luther,
   he had it
   nailed to the very door of the National Assembly where it could not fail
   to command attention. But with the capture of the King and his return to
   Paris, Paine's republican bubble burst, although not without having
   planted a seed in the minds of some fearless and dangerous men.
        He now returned to England, where a large-scale model of his iron
   bridge was being built. He fomented republican clubs, which exchanged
   sentiments of friendship with those in Scotland and Ireland, as; well as
   those in France. Paine's revolution seemed to be brewing in Great Britain.
   Edmund Burke, whose friendly actions during the American Revolution had
   endeared him to Paine, made Paine's acquaintance. They visited together
   and corresponded. Suddenly',
   Burke changed sides and assailed the principles of the French Revolution.
   Paine accused Burke of being a Pensioner in a fictitious name, and hinted
   this might have been the real reason he changed his mind. Paine gloried in
   the task of publicly answering him in his monumental work the Rights of
   Man. It first appeared on February 22, appropriately dedicated to George
   Washington.  Praising Washington's "exemplary virtue," he prayed that he
   would see "the new world regenerate the old." At this time Paine was at
   the height of his popularity, and he felt certain that Rights of Man would
   do for England what Common Sense had done for America. Unfortunately for
   his cause, it was at just this time that the most dreadful massacres of
   innocent in France took place. England, horrified at this kind of a
   revolution, took warning and went to the other extreme, and for a while
   England was the least free spot on earth. The National Guard
   was called out. A Royal Proclamation was issued for the purpose of
   suppressing Paine's book, and by court action Paine was declared an
   outlaw.  Publishers, printers and sellers of Paine's work were jailed for
   libel as fast as they could be tried. Yet Paine's book seems mild enough
   to us today. Paine said of the libel:
   "If to expose the fraud and imposition of monarchy, and every species of
   hereditary government to lessen the oppression of taxes - to propose plans
   for the education of helpless infancy, and the comfortable support of the
   aged and distressed - to endeavor
   to conciliate nations to each other - to extirpate the horrid practice of
   war - to promote universal peace, civilization, and commerce - and to
   break the chains of political superstition, and raise degraded man to his
   proper rank; if these things be libellous,
   let me live the life of a libeller, and let the name of
   LIBELLER be engraved on my tomb."
    
   Paine also would provide funds to defray the funeral expense of persons,
   who, travelling for work, die at a distance from their friends.
        The polished rhetoric of Burke could not refute the blunt logic of
   Paine's arguments. The government resorted to a smear campaign of
   unprecedented proportions. It had published
   a Life of Paine, which maliciously purported on its title page to be "A
   Defense of Paine's Works" and then was filled With lies and slanders.
   According to this Life, the death of Paine's first wife was due to ill
   usage and a premature birth; the cause of legal separation from his second
   wife was said to be his refusal to cohabit with her throughout the three
   and one-half years of their marriage; and the claim was made that he had
   swindled many, including his own mother.
        In contradistinction, consider the. treatment  Paine received when he
   went to France. Four Departments had vied with each other to elect Paine
   to the French National Convention. Paine accepted a seat from the
   Department of Calais and henceforth embraced and defended the French
   Revolution. He worked on a new democratic Constitution for
   France. Unfortuneately, it was never activated, and as a result chaos
   reigned. This proved to be disastrous to France. The murderous course now
   taken by the Revolution alienated the entire world, and Paine had to take
   full share of responsibility for all actions of a government established
   according to the form he had so strongly advocated. Yet Paine tried to
   prevent bloodshed and went further than anyone else to save Louis XVI from
   the guillotine. Paine, the hater of kings, cried, "Kill the King, but not
   the man," for he remembered that this same French King had courageously
   given vital aid to the struggling American colonies in their darkest hour.
        In these trying days he turned toward the notes he had made on
   religion. He saw how God in the Bible acted exactly like a man, having the
   same passions and revenges. The more he read the Bible the less sense it
   made.  He was unwilling to worship a God who commanded man to commit
   crimes; for example: from First Samuel, XV, 3; "Slay both man and woman,
   infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass." And worst of all, the
   only reason given for this butchery
   in the Bible was that 400 years before their ancestors had the courage to
   defend their homes from invasion.  As for miracles, it did not seem to him
   unbelievable for a whale to swallow Jonah. It would have been far more
   miraculous had Jonah swallowed the whale! As Paine peered into the sky
   everything seemed perfect in the universe: night followed day; the seasons
   came and went regularly; the earth revolved; the  planets kept to their
   orbits. There was no wickedness there. Nature was likewise magnificent and
   beautiful.
        He had planned to wait until near the end of his life to publish his
   notes on religion, for then, being closer to the Next World, he would be
   more concerned. But this reign of terror in France so threatened his life
   with early extinction that Paine resolved to bring his work to a close and
   publish the result.
        Robespierre, smashing all who opposed him, considered Paine's
   humanitarian sentiments a drawback, and ordered this arch REBEL of England
   and America jailed, ironically, as a dangerous conservative. So well had
   Paine estimated his remaining freedom that only six hours after he had
   finished his writing, the dreaded knock came on the door; the police had
   arrived and he was arrested. He contrived by a subterfuge to stop on the
   way to prison at the lodgings of Joel
   Barlow (Yale, Class,o f 1776) who was doing the proofreading of his book.
   He handed to Barlow the remainder of his manuscript, called The Age of
   Reason, and asked him to publish it at once. He had dedicated it to his
   fellow citizens of America:
   "I put the following work under your protection. It contains my opinion
   upon religion. you will do me the justice to remember, that I have
   strenuously supported the right of every man to his own opinion, however
   different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this
   right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he
   precludes himself the right of changing it.
   "The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is reason. I have
   never used
   any other, and I trust I never shall."
    
        Paine's book was fiercely denounced in all other countries as the
   work of the devil. In England, Thomas Williams, who reprinted it, was
   thrown into jail and the work suppressed
   As blasphemous. Punishment as severe as fourteen years in a penal colony,
   like Botany Bay, was inflicted. Even speaking favorably of the work might
   earn one the pillory.
   Nevertheless, The Age of Reason continued to .circulate surreptitiously.
        Paine, as an American citizen, expected President Washington to
   intercede at once and secure his release from jail, since no charge had
   been preferred against him. Month after month Paine waited in vain and
   became dangerously ill due to his unjust confinement in a damp cell.
    Robespierre finally condemned him to death, but before the busy
   guillotine had time to cut off Paine's head, Robespierre had lost his own.
   Many months later our ambassador James Monroe, on his own responsibility,
   obtained Paine's release, but Paine's resentment against Washington's
   neglect mounted.
        He wrote Washington two identical letters, asking him to explain why
   he had ditched his old friend, and sent them by different vessels to
   guarantee their receipt. Washington got both. When a year passed without
   any reply, Paine, feeling betrayed, hotheadedly published in America a
   bitter attack on Washington. This accomplished little more than to
   complete Paine's fall from public favor, particularly in his own country.
        Paine's next important work was Agrarian Justice. Here he outlined
   his plan for really ameliorating the conditions of the poor and aged. By
   levelling a tax on the landowners, he would create a national fund in
   every nation, to pay every person reaching twenty-one years of age a sum
   of money to enable him or her to make a beginning in the world. When one
   reached the age of 50 (then considered old) a sum would be given,
   annually, sufficient to enable him to go on living without wretchedness
   and to go decently out of the world. Paine's excellently thought-out
   social security program was considered too advanced to receive the
   attention it deserved.
        Now Paine became one of a group in Paris to organize a new religious
   society called The Theophilanthropists (a compound word meaning "Lovers of
   God and Man.") Paine's religion consisted only of belief in "one God" and
   "doing good." The French government at first supported this religion and
   turned over to their use to Notre Dame church and three other church
   edifices in Paris, but after a few years' growth, Napoleon, who had made
   peace with the Pope, crushed the society.
        Paine's battle for freedom in the Old World had come to a grinding
   halt. Paine, however, refused to give up. He now decided to return to the
   New World. He would go to his farm in New Rochelle, hoping to find freedom
   and tolerance there. Thomas Jefferson, the first real Democrat, who had
   steadfastly remained a friend of Paine, was President of the United
   States. He was bold enough to offer a frigate (today's equivalent a
   battleship) to bring Paine safely through
   any British blockade back to America. However, Paine took an ordinary
   vessel.
        Much to Paine's dismay, from the moment of landing in Baltimore he
   was outrageously attacked as a blasphemer. This continued unrelentingly
   for the remaining five years of
   his life. The Federalists taking umbrage at Paine's attack on their idol,
   Washington, pulled out all the stops in fiery denunciation of Paine the
   Infidel. Even on a stage coach, the driver, learning that Paine was a
   passenger refused to proceed until Paine got out, fearing that such a
   defiler of God would invite retribution by lightning, at least. So whipped
   up was this hatred, that the City of New Rochelle stopped him from voting
   when he went to cast his ballot, on the grounds that
   he was no longer a citizen. How ungrateful could this country be?
        Many of Paine's friends shunned him, except disciples like Elihu
   Palmer, or the fearless democrat, President Jefferson, and a few others.
   Paine, past seventy, still continued to publish powerful essays furthering
   both his religious and political principles and assailing his enemies.
   Since his name was no longer an asset, they were mostly anonymous.
        All this controversy might have been expected to end in
   1809 when Paine died at the age of seventy-two, one hundred and fifty
   years ago, but this was not to be the case. William Cobbett, an ultra-Tory
   during his first American sojourn, printed in the [Philadelphia] Political
   Censor, September, 1796, thirteen years before Paine died, this unfriendly
   prediction:
   "He has done all the mischief he can in the world, and whether his carcass
   is at last to be suffered to rot on the earth, or to be dried in the air
   is of very little consequence. Whenever and wherever he breathes his last
   he will excite neither sorrow nor
   Compassion; no friendly hand will close his eyes, not a groan will be
   uttered, not a tear will be shed. Like Judas he will be remembered by
   posterity; men will learn to express all that is base, malignant,
   treacherous, unnatural and blasphemous by the single monosyllable, PAINE."
    
   Who would believe that only a few years after Paine's death Cobbett would
   retract every vile word he had written about Paine? Having the opportunity
   to study Paine's writings during a long confinement in Newgate Prison for
   expressing some liberal sentiments, Cobbett became a convert. Doing a
   complete about-face, he started to expound Paine's principles to the
   British masses. Later he was forced to flee once more to America. After a
   two-year sojourn there, in an act of unusual penance he exhumed Paine's
   bones from their resting place in New Rochelle and brought them to England
   in order to give them a new funeral worthy of so great a man. The
   British, however, now despising Cobbett almost as much as Paine, ruined
   the plan by ridicule. Paine's bones have since disappeared, giving
   circulation to a weird tale used by a preacher, denouncing Paine.
   "Thomas Paine was so wicked that he could not be
   buried; his bones were thrown into a box which was bandied
   about the world until it came to a button manufacturer, and
   now Paine is traveling around in the form of buttons."
    
        Succeeding generations have seen the smoke screen of personal abuse
   around Paine gradually disappear, allowing him to stand forth as the
   greatest advocate of democracy, social security and freedom of thought the
   world has yet seen.
        Public appreciation of Paine is mounting. In England, his birthplace
   at Thetford, Norfolk, is marked in bronze and at Lewes, Sussex, all places
   associated with him are marked. In London, his portrait hangs in the
   National Portrait Gallery, and there is another portrait and a bust in the
   South Place Ethical society. In France, a great statue by Gutzon Borglum
   of Paine pleading for the life of Louis XVI stands facing the dormitories
   of the university of Paris. In America, he has been elected to the Hall of
   Fame in New York, where his bust stands next to that of his great friend
   Thomas Jefferson. There is another bust in the New York Historical
   Society, and his last home in Greenwich village is marked by a bronze
   plaque. If you visit Jefferson's home in Monticello, the guides will point
   out to you the miniature portrait of Paine painted from life by John
   Trumbull. In the National Gallery, Washington, D.C., there is a portrait
   painted from life by John Wesley Jarvis. In Philadelphia, his portrait
   hangs in Independence Hall. There is a small portrait in the American
   Antiquarian Society. In New Jersey, at Bordentown, his little house is
   marked with bronze, while in Morristown, there is a large statue which has
   been gold-plated,
   carrying out the suggestion once made by Napoleon that every city in the
   world should erect a statue of gold to Paine. Napoleon also said he never
   went to bed at night without a
   copy of Paine's Rights of Man under his pillow. New Rochelle has also
   repented, for the original burial place is graced by an imposing monument;
   the home is preserved as a historic shrine; and there is a beautiful
   museum building nearby which is devoted to an exhibition of his works.
   They even gave him back his citizenship by an official act a few years
   ago. His works, which will always remain his real monument, can still be
   read to advantage. London has recently printed nine editions of the Rights
   of Man, and this year there has been printed in New York 100,000 copies of
   his Age of Reason. The Soviet Union, showing great interest, has
   translated into
   Russian all of Paine's works this year. Paine's disarmament plan, in which
   he spelled out all details, may have influenced Khrushchev's recent
   proposals to the United Nations.
        Paine summed up his philosophy in these words:
    
   "Independence is my happiness, and I view things
   as they are, without regard to place or person; my
   country is the world, and my religion is to do good."
