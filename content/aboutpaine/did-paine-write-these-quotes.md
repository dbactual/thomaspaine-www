The following quotes are NOT from Thomas Paine:

"*Lead, follow, or get out of the way*."
This quote does not exist in the Paine corpus, and seems to have its orign in the 20th century.

"*Reputation is what other people think of us. Character is what God knows of us*." 
This quote is from a book by Shannon L. Alder.

"*The government that governs best governs least.*"
This is from Henry David Thoreau, who borrowed it from the cover of the journal *Democratic Review*, 1837-1859.

"*The duty of a patriot is to protect his country from its government.*"
This is from Edward Abbey in *A Voice Crying in the Wilderness*, pg.19. And the actual quote is “A patriot must be ready to defend his country from his government.” The version presented here is the one used on the Internet.

"*Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property... Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.*"
This quote is in *Thoughts on Defensive War* in Foner's *Complte Works of Thomas Paine*, however there is a question, at this point, as to whether this is Paine's writing.
