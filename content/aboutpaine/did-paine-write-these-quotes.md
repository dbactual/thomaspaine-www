The following quotes are NOT from Thomas Paine:

"Lead, follow, or get out of the way."

"Reputation is what other people think of us. Character is what God knows of us."

"The government that governs best governs least."

"The duty of a patriot is to protect his country from its government."

"Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property... Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them."
