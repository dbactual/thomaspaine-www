                   In Memory of Thomas Paine by Walt Whitman

   Spoken at Lincoln Hall, Philadelphia, Sunday, Jan. 28, 1877, for 140th
   anniversary of T. P.'s birth-day.

   SOME thirty-five years ago, in New York city, at Tammany hall, of which
   place I was then a frequenter, I happen'd to become quite well acquainted
   with Thomas Paine's perhaps most intimate chum, and certainly his later
   years' very frequent companion, a remarkably fine old man, Col. Fellows,
   who may yet be remember'd by some stray relics of that period and spot. If
   you will allow me, I will first give a description of the Colonel himself.
   He was tall, of military bearing, aged about 78 I should think, hair white
   as snow, clean-shaved on the face, dress'd very neatly, a tail-coat of
   blue cloth with metal buttons, buff vest, pantaloons of drab color, and
   his neck, breast and wrists showing the whitest of linen. Under all
   circumstances, fine manners; a good but not profuse talker, his wits still
   fully about him, balanced and live and undimm'd as ever. He kept pretty
   fair health, though so old. For employment-for he was poor-he had a post
   as constable of some of the upper courts. I used to think him very
   picturesque on the fringe of a crowd holding a tall staff, with his erect
   form, and his superb, bare, thickhair'd, closely-cropt white head. The
   judges and young lawyers, with whom he was ever a favorite, and the
   subject of respect, used to call him Aristides. It was the general opinion
   among them that if manly rectitude and the instincts of absolute justice
   remain'd vital anywhere about New York City Hall, or Tammany, they were to
   be found in Col. Fellows. He liked young men, and enjoy'd to leisurely
   talk with them over a social glass of toddy, after his day's work, (he on
   these occasions never drank but one glass,) and it was at reiterated
   meetings of this kind in old Tammany's back parlor of those days, that he
   told me much about Thomas Paine. At one of our interviews he gave me a
   minute account of Paine's sickness and death. In short, from those talks,
   I was and am satisfied that my old friend, with his mark'd advantages, had
   mentally, morally and emotionally gauged the author of "Common Sense," and
   besides giving me a good portrait of his appearance and manners, had taken
   the true measure of his interior
   character.

   Paine's practical demeanor, and much of his theoretical belief, was a
   mixture of the French and English schools of a century ago, and the best
   of both. Like most old-fashion'd people, he drank a glass or two every
   day, but was no tippler, nor intemperate, let alone being a drunkard. He
   lived simply and economically, but quite well-was always cheery and
   courteous, perhaps occasionally a little blunt, having very positive
   opinions upon politics, religion, and so forth. That he labor'd well and
   wisely for the States in the trying period of their parturition, and in
   the seeds of their character, there seems to me no question. I dare not
   say how much of what our Union is owning and enjoying to day-its
   independence-its ardent belief in, and substantial practice of, radical
   human rights-and the severance of its government from all ecclesiastical
   and superstitious dominion-I dare not say how much of all this is owing to
   Thomas Paine, but I am inclined to think a good portion of it decidedly
   is.

   But I was not going either into an analysis or eulogium of the man. I
   wanted to carry you back a generation or two, and give you by indirection
   a moment's glance-and also to ventilate a very earnest and I believe
   authentic opinion, nay conviction, of that time, the fruit of the
   interviews I have mention'd, and of questioning and cross-questioning,
   clench'd by my best information since, that Thomas Paine had a noble
   personality, as exhibited in presence, face, voice, dress, manner, and
   what may be call'd his atmosphere and magnetism, especially the later
   years of his life. I am sure of it. Of the foul and foolish fictions yet
   told about the circumstances of his decease, the absolute fact is that as
   he lived a good life, after its kind, he died calmly and philosophically,
   as became him. He served the embryo Union with most precious service-a
   service that every man, woman and child in our thirty-eight States is to
   some extent receiving the benefit of to day-and I for one here cheerfully,
   reverently throw my pebble on the cairn of his memory. As we all know, the
   season demands-or rather, will it ever be out of season?-that America
   learn to better dwell on her choicest possession, the legacy of her good
   and faithful men-that she well preserve their fame, if unquestion'd-or, if
   need be, that she fail not to dissipate what clouds have intruded on that
   fame, and burnish it newer, truer and brighter, continually.

                                                                                                                                                       

                 WITH WALT WHITMAN IN CAMDEN by Horace Traubel

                          (from the TPNHA Collection)

   January 25, 1889

   After continual general talk of Poe, W. said:

   "I have seen Poe - met him: he impressed me very favorably: was dark,
   quiet, handsome - Southern from top to toe: languid, tired out, it is
   true, but altogether ingratiating."

   Was that in New York?

   "Oh, yes: there: we had only a brief visit: he was frankly conciliatory: I
   left him with no doubts left, if I ever had any." Poe was "curiously a
   victim of history-like Paine." "The disposition to parade, to magnify, his
   defects has grown in to a habit: every literary, every moralistic,
   jackanapes who comes along has to give him an additional kick. His
   weaknesses were obvious enough to anybody: but what do they amount to
   after all? Paine is defamed in the same way: poor Paine: rich Paine: they
   spare him nothing."

   I said: " You should write about Paine."

   He nodded, "So I should, I don't think there's anybody living - anybody at
   all - (I don't think there ever was anybody, living or dead) - more able
   than I am to depict, to picture, Paine, in the right way. I have told you
   of my old friend Colonel Fellows: he was an uncommon man both in what he
   looked like and in what he was: nobly formed, with thick white hair -
   white as milk: beard: striking characteristics everyhow."

   He proceeded: "We had many talks together in the back room of the City
   Hall. The instant he saw I was interested in Paine he became communicative
   - frankly unbosomed himself. His Paine story amounted to a resurrection of
   Paine out of the horrible calumnies, infamies, under which orthodox hatred
   had buried him. Paine was old, alone, poor: it's that, it's what accrues
   from that, that his slanderers have made the most of: anything lower,
   meaner, more contemptible, I cannot imagine: to take an aged man - a man
   tired to death after a complicated life of toil, struggle, anxiety - weak,
   dragged down, at death's door: poor: with perhaps habits that may come
   with such distress: then to pull him into the mud, distort everything he
   does and says: oh, it's infamous! There seems to be this hyena
   disposition, some exceptional (thank God rare!) venom, in some men which
   is never satisfied except it is engaged in some work of vandalism. I can
   forgive anything but that."
