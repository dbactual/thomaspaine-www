   Life and Deeds of Thomas Paine

   LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:
   
   Through all the centuries gone, the mind of man has been beleaguered by
   the mailed hosts of superstition. Slowly and painfully has advanced the
   army of deliverance. Hated by those they wished to rescue, despised by
   those they were dying to save, these grand soldiers, the immortal
   deliverers, have fought without thanks, labored without applause, suffered
   without pity, and they have died execrated and abhorred. For the good of
   mankind they accepted isolation, poverty and calumny. They gave up all,
   sacrificed all, lost all but truth and self-respect.

   One of the bravest soldiers in this army was Thomas Paine: and for one, I
   feel indebted to him for the liberty we are enjoying this day. Born among
   the poor, where children are burdens; in a country where real liberty was
   unknown; where the priveleges of class were guarded with infinite
   jealousy, and the rights of the individual trampled beneath the feet of
   priests and nobles; where intellectual freedom was Infidelity, it is
   wonderful that the idea of true liberty ever entered his brain.

   Poverty was his mother--Necessity his master.

   He had more brains than books; more sense than education; more courage
   than politeness; more strength than polish. He had no veneration for old
   mistakes -- no admiration for ancient lies. He loved the truth for the
   truth's sake, and for man's sake. He saw oppression on every hand;
   injustice everywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench;
   tyranny on the throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause
   of the weak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled
   few.

   At the age of thirty-seven Thomas Paine left England for America, with the
   high hope of being instrumental in the establishment of free government.
   In his own country he could accomplish nothing. Those two Vultures --
   Church and State -- were ready to tear into pieces and devour the heart of
   anyone who might deny their divine right to enslave the world.

   Upon his arrival in this country, he found himself possessed of a letter
   of introduction signed by another Infidel, the illustrious Franklin.
   (Applause.) This, and his native genius, constituted his entire capital;
   and he needed no more. He found the colonies clamoring for justice;
   whining about their grievances; upon their knees at the foot of the
   throne, imploring the mixture of idiocy and insanity George the III, by
   the grace of God, for a restoration of their ancient priveleges. They were
   not endeavoring to become free men, but were trying to soften the heart of
   their master. They were perfectly willing to make brick if Pharoah would
   furnish the straw. The colonists wished for, hoped for and prayed for
   reconcilation. They did not dream of independence.

   Paine gave to the world his "COMMON SENSE." It was the first argument for
   separation, the first assault upon the British form of government, the
   first blow for a republic, and it aroused our fathers like a trumpet's
   blast.
   He was the first to perceive the destiny of the New World.

   No other pamphlet ever accomplished such wonderful results. It was filled
   with argument, reason, persuasion, and unanswerable logic. It opened a new
   world. It filled the present with hope and the future with honor.
   Everywhere the people responded, and in a few months the Continental
   Congress declared the colonies free and independent States.

   A new nation was born.

   It is simple justice to say that Paine did more to cause the Declaration
   of Independence than any other man. Neither should it be forgotten that
   his attacks upon Great Britain were also attacks upon monarchy; and while
   he convinced the people that the colonies ought to separate from the
   mother country, he also proved to them that a free government is the best
   that can be instituted among men.

   In my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever
   lived. "What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever went
   together." Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of power, had no
   effect upon him. He examined into the why and wherefore of things. He was
   perfectly radical in his mode of thought. Nothing short of the bed-rock
   satisfied him. His enthusiasm for what he believed to be right knew no
   bounds. During all the dark scenes of the Revolution, never for one moment
   did he despair. Year after year his brave words were ringing through the
   land, and by the bivouac fires the weary soldiers read the inspiring words
   of "Common Sense," filled with ideas sharper than their swords, and
   consecrated themselves anew to the cause of Freedom.

   Paine was not content with having aroused the spirit of independence, but
   he gave every energy of his soul to keep that spirit alive. He was with
   the army. He shared its defeats, its dangers, and its glory. When the
   situation became desperate, when gloom settled upon all, he gave them the
   "CRISIS." It was a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, leading the
   way to freedom, honor, and glory. He shouted to them, "These are the times
   that try men's souls. The summer soldier, and the sunshine patriot, will,
   in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands
   it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."

   To those who wished to put the war off to some future day, with a lofty
   and touching spirit of self-sacrifice he said: "Every generous parent
   should say, 'If there must be war let it be in my day, that my child may
   have peace.'" To the cry that Americans were rebels, he replied: "He that
   rebels against reason is a real rebel; but he that in defence of reason
   rebels against tyranny, has a better title to 'Defender of the Faith' than
   George the Third."

   Some said it was not to the interest of the colonies to be free. Paine
   answered this by saying, "To know whether it be the interest of the
   continent to be independent, we need ask only this simple, easy question:
   'Is it the interest of a man to be a boy all his life?'" He found many who
   would listen to nothing, and to them he said, "That to argue with a man
   who has renounced his reason is like giving medicine to the dead." This
   sentiment ought to adorn the walls of every orthodox church.

   There is a world of political wisdom in this: "England lost her liberty in
   a long chain of right reasoning from wrong principles"; and there is real
   discrimination in saying' "The Greeks and Romans were strongly possessed
   of the spirit of liberty, but not the principles, for at the time that
   they were determined not to be slaves themselves, they employed their
   power to enslave the rest of mankind."

   In his letter to the British people, in which he tried to convince them
   that war was not to their interest, occurs the following passage brimful
   of common sense: "War never can be the interest of a trading nation any
   more than quarreling can be profitable to a man in business. But to make
   war with those who trade with us is like setting a bull-dog upon a
   customer at the shop-door."

   The writings of Paine fairly glitter with simple, compact, logical
   statements, that carry conviction to the dullest and most prejudiced. He
   had the happiest possible way of putting the case; in asking questions in
   such a way that they answer themselves, and in stating his premises so
   clearly that the deduction could not be avoided.

   Day and night he labored for America; month after month, year after year,
   he gave himself to the Great Cause, until there was "a government of the
   people and for the people," and until the banner of the stars floated over
   a continent redeemed, and consecrated to the happiness of mankind.

   At the close of the Revolution, no one stood higher in America than Thomas
   Paine. The best, the wisest, the most patriotic, were his friends and
   admirers; and had he been thinking only of his own good he might have
   rested from his toils and spent the remainder of his life in comfort and
   in ease. He could have been what the world is pleased to call
   "respectable". He could have died surrounded by clergymen, warriors and
   statesmen. At his death there would have been an imposing funeral, miles
   of carriages, civic societies, salvos of artillery, a nation in mourning,
   and, above all, a splendid monument covered with lies.

   He chose rather to benefit mankind.

   At that time the seeds sown by the great Infidels were beginning to bear
   fruit in France. The people were beginning to think.

   The Eighteenth Century was crowning its gray hairs with the wreath of
   Progress.

   On every hand Science was bearing testimony against the Church. Voltaire
   had filled Europe with light; D'Holbach was giving to the lite of Paris
   the principles contained in his "System of Nature." The Encyclopedists had
   attacked superstition with information for the masses. The foundation of
   things began to be examined. A few had the courage to keep their shoes on
   and let the bush burn. Miracles began to get scarce. Everywhere the people
   began to inquire. America had set an example to the world. The word
   Liberty was in the mouths of men, and they began to wipe the dust from
   their knees.

   The dawn of a new day had appeared.

   Thomas Paine went to France. Into the new movement he threw all his
   energies. His fame had Thomas Paine went to France. Into the new movement
   he threw all his energies. His fame had gone before him, and he was
   welcomed as a friend of the human race, and as a champion of free
   government.

   He had never relinquished his intention of pointing out to his countrymen
   the defects, absurdities and abuses of the English government. For this
   purpose he composed and published his greatest political work, "THE RIGHTS
   OF MAN." This work should be read by every man and woman. It is concise,
   accurate, natural, convincing, and unanswerable. It shows great thought;
   an intimate knowledge of the various forms of government; deep insight
   into the very springs of human action, and a courage that compels respect
   and admiration. The most difficult political problems are solved in a few
   sentences. The venerable arguments in favor of wrong are refuted with a
   question -- answered with a word. For forcible illustration, apt
   comparison, accuracy and clearness of statement, and absolute
   thoroughness, it has never been excelled.

   The fears of the administration were aroused, and Paine was prosecuted for
   libel and found guilty; and yet there is not a sentiment in the entire
   work that will not challenge the admiration of every civilized man. It is
   a magazine of political wisdom, an arsenal of ideas, and an honor, not
   only to Thomas Paine, but to human nature itself. It could have been
   written only by the man who had the generosity, the exalted patriotism,
   the goodness to say, "The world is my country, and to do good my
   religion."

   There is in all the utterances of the world no grander, no sublimer
   sentiment. There is no creed that can be compared with it for a moment. It
   should be wrought in gold, adorned with jewels, and impressed upon every
   human heart: "The world is my country, and to do good my religion."

   In 1792, Paine was elected by the department of Calais as their
   representative in the National Assembly. So great was his popularity in
   France that he was selected about the same time by the people of no less
   than four departments.

   Upon taking his place in the Assembly he was appointed as one of a
   committee to draft a constitution for France. Had the French people taken
   the advice of Thomas Paine there would have been no "reign of terror." The
   streets of Paris would not have been filled with blood. The Revolution
   would have been the grandest success of the world. The truth is that Paine
   was too conservative to suit the leaders of the French Revolution. They,
   to a great extent, were carried away by hatred and a desire to destroy.
   They had suffered so long, they had borne so much, that it was impossible
   for them to be moderate in the hour of victory.

   Besides all this, the French people had been so robbed by the government,
   so degraded by the church, that they were not fit material with which to
   construct a republic. Many of the leaders longed to establish a beneficent
   and just government, but the people asked for revenge.

   Paine was filled with a real love for mankind. His philanthropy was
   boundless. He wished to destroy monarchy -- not the monarch. He voted for
   the destruction of tyranny, and against the death of the king. He wished
   to establish a government on a new basis; one that would forget the past;
   one that would give privileges to none, and protection to all.

   In the Assembly, where nearly all were demanding the execution of the king
   -- where to differ from the majority was to be suspected, and, where to be
   suspected was almost certain death Thomas Paine had the courage, the
   goodness and the justice to vote against death. To vote against the
   execution of the king was a vote against his own life. This was the
   sublimity of devotion to principle. For this he was arrested, imprisoned,
   and doomed to death.

   Search the records of the world and you will find but few sublimer acts
   than that of Thomas Paine voting against the king's death. He, the hater
   of despotism, the abhorrer of monarchy, the champion of the rights of man,
   the republican, accepting death to save the life of a deposed tyrant -- of
   a throneless king. This was the last grand act of his political life --
   the sublime conclusion of his political career.

   All his life he had been the disinterested friend of man. He had labored
   -- not for money, not for fame, but for the general good. He had aspired
   to no office; had asked no recognition of his services, but had ever been
   content to labor as a common soldier in the army of Progress. Confining
   his efforts to no country, looking upon the world as his field of action,
   filled with a genuine love for the right, he found himself imprisoned by
   the very people he had striven to save.

   Had his enemies succeeded in bringing him to the block, he would have
   escaped the calumnies and the hatred of the Christian world. In this
   country, at least, he would have ranked with the proudest names. On the
   anniversary of the Declaration his name would have been upon the lips of
   all the orators, and his memory in the hearts of all the people.

   Thomas Paine had not finished his career.

   He had spent his life thus far in destroying the power of kings, and now
   he turned his attention to the priests. He knew that every abuse had been
   embalmed in Scripture -- that every outrage was in partnership with some
   holy text. He knew that the throne skulked behind the altar, and both
   behind a pretended revelation from God. By this time he had found that it
   was of little use to free the body and leave the mind in chains. He had
   explored the foundations of despotism, and had found them infinitely
   rotten. He had dug under the throne, and it occurred to him that he would
   take a look behind the altar.

   The result of his investigations was given to the world in the "AGE OF
   REASON" From the moment of its publication he became infamous. He was
   calumniated beyond measure. To slander him was to secure the thanks of the
   church. All his services were instantly forgotten, disparaged or denied.
   He was shunned as though he had been a pestilence. Most of his old friends
   forsook him. He was regarded as a moral plague, and at the bare mention of
   his name the bloody hands of the church were raised in horror. He was
   denounced as the most despicable of men.

   Not content with following him to his grave, they pursued him after death
   with redoubled fury, and recounted with infinite gusto and satisfaction
   the supposed horrors of his death-bed; gloried in the fact that he was
   forlorn and friendless, and gloated like fiends over what they supposed to
   be the agonizing remorse of his lonely death.

   It is wonderful that all his services were thus forgotten. It is amazing
   that one kind word did not fall from some pulpit; that some one did not
   accord to him, at least honesty. Strange, that in the general denunciation
   some one did not remember his labor for liberty, his devotion to
   principle. his zeal for the rights of his fellow-men. He had, by brave and
   splendid effort, associated his name with the cause of Progress. He had
   made it impossible to write the history of political freedom with his name
   left out. He was one of the creators of light; one of the heralds of the
   dawn. He hated tyranny in the name of kings, and in the name of God, with
   every drop of his noble blood. He believed in liberty and justice, and in
   the sacred doctrine of human equality. Under these divine banners he
   fought the battle of his life. In both worlds he offered his blood for the
   good of man. In the wilderness of America, in the French Assembly, in the
   somber cell waiting for death, he was the same unflinching, unwavering
   friend of his race; the same undaunted champion of universal freedom. And
   for this he has been hated; for this the church has violated even his
   grave.

   This is enough to make one believe that nothing is more natural than for
   men to devour their benefactors. The people in all ages have crucified and
   glorified. Whoever lifts his voice against abuses, whoever arraigns the
   past at the bar of the present, whoever asks the king to show his
   commission, or questions the authority of the priest, will be denounced as
   the enemy of man and God. In all ages reason has been regarded as the
   enemy of religion. Nothing has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as
   a total denial of the authority of your own mind. Self-reliance has been
   thought a deadly sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and
   consolation of superstition has always horrified the church. By some
   unaccountable infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of
   immense importance. All religions have been based upon the idea that God
   will forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who
   doubts or denies. Belief is regarded as the one essential thing. To
   practice justice, to love mercy, is not enough. You must believe in some
   incomprehensible creed. You must say, "Once one is three, and three times
   one is one." The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to believe,
   was execrated. Nothing so outrages the feelings of the church as a moral
   unbeliever -- nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.

   When Paine was born, the world was religious, the pulpit was the real
   throne, and the churches were making every effort to crush out of the
   brain the idea that it had the right to think.

   The splendid saying of Lord Bacon, that "the inquiry of truth which is the
   love-making or wooing of it, the knowledge of truth, which is the presence
   of it, and the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, are the
   sovereign good of human nature," has been, and ever will be, rejected by
   religionists. Intellectual liberty, as a matter of necessity, forever
   destroys the idea that belief is either praise or blame-worthy, and is
   wholly inconsistent with every creed in Christendom. Paine recognized this
   truth. He also saw that as long as the Bible was considered inspired, this
   infamous doctrine of the virtue of belief would be believed and preached.
   He examined the Scriptures for himself, and found them filled with
   cruelty, absurdity and immorality.

   He again made up his mind to sacrifice himself for the good of his
   fellow-men.

   He commenced with the assertion, "That any system of religion that has
   anything in it that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true system."
   What a beautiful, what a tender sentiment! No wonder the church began to
   hate him. He believed in one God, and no more. After this life he hoped
   for happiness. He believed that true religion consisted in doing justice,
   loving mercy, in endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy, and in
   offering to God the fruit of the heart. He denied the inspiration of the
   Scriptures. This was his crime.

   He contended that it is a contradiction in terms to call anything a
   revelation that comes to us second-hand, either verbally or in writing. He
   asserted that revelation is necessarily limited to the first
   communication, and that after that it is only an account of something
   which another person says was a revelation to him. We have only his word
   for it, as it was never made to us. This argument never has been and
   probably never will be answered. He denied the divine origin of Christ,
   and showed conclusively that the pretended prophecies of the Old Testament
   had no reference to him whatever; and yet he believed that Christ was a
   virtuous and amiable man; that the morality he taught and practiced was of
   the most benevolent and elevated character, and that it had not been
   exceeded by any. Upon this point he entertained the same sentiments now
   held by the Unitarians, and in fact by all the most enlightened
   Christians.

   In his time the church believed and taught that every word in the Bible
   was absolutely true. Since his day it has been proven false in its
   cosmogony, false in its astronomy, false in its chronology, false in its
   history, and so far as the Old Testament is concerned, false in almost
   everything. There are but few, if any, scientific men who apprehend that
   the Bible is literally true. Who on earth at this day would pretend to
   settle any scientific question by a text from the Bible? The old belief is
   confined to the ignorant and zealous. The church itself will before long
   be driven to occupy the position of Thomas Paine. The best minds of the
   orthodox world, to-day, are endeavoring to prove the existence of a
   personal Deity. All other questions occupy a minor place. You are no
   longer asked to swallow the Bible whole, whale, Jonah and all; you are
   simply required to believe in God, and pay your pew-rent. There is not now
   an enlightened minister in the world who will seriously contend that
   Samson's strength was in his hair, or that the necromancers of Egypt could
   turn water into blood, and pieces of wood into serpents. These follies
   have passed away, and the only reason that the religious world can now
   have for disliking Paine is that they have been forced to adopt so many of
   his opinions.

   Paine thought the barbarities of the Old Testament inconsistent with what
   he deemed the real character of God. He believed that murder, massacre and
   indiscriminate slaughter had never been commanded by the Deity. He
   regarded much of the Bible as childish, unimportant and foolish. The
   scientific world entertains the same opinion. Paine attacked the Bible
   precisely in the same spirit in which he had attacked the pretensions of
   kings. He used the same weapons. All the pomp in the world could not make
   him cower. His reason knew no "Holy of Holies," except the abode of Truth.
   The sciences were then in their infancy. The attention of the really
   learned had not been directed to an impartial examination of our pretended
   revelation. It was accepted by most as a matter of course. The church was
   all-powerful, and no one, unless thoroughly imbued with the spirit of
   self-sacrifice, thought for a moment of disputing the fundamental
   doctrines of Christianity. The infamous doctrines that salvation depends
   upon belief -- upon a mere intellectual conviction -- was then believed
   and preached. To doubt was to secure the damnation of your soul. This
   absurd and devilish doctrine shocked the common sense of Thomas Paine, and
   he denounced it with the fervor of honest indignation. This doctrine,
   although infinitely ridiculous, has been nearly universal, and has been as
   hurtful as senseless. For the overthrow of this infamous tenet, Paine
   exerted all his strength. He left few arguments to be used by those who
   should come after him, and he used none that have been refuted. The
   combined wisdom and genius of all mankind cannot possibly conceive of an
   argument against liberty of thought. Neither can they show why any one
   should be punished, either in this world or another, for acting honestly
   in accordance with reason; and yet a doctrine with every possible argument
   against it has been, and still is, believed and defended by the entire
   orthodox world. Can it be possible that we have been endowed with reason
   simply that our souls may be caught in its toils and snares, that we may
   be led by its false and delusive glare out of the narrow path that leads
   to joy into the broad way of everlasting death? Is it possible that we
   have been given reason simply that we may through faith ignore its
   deductions, and avoid its conclusions? Ought the sailor to throw away his
   compass and depend entirely upon the fog? If reason is not to be depended
   upon in matters of religion, that is to say, in respect of our duties to
   the Deity, why should it be relied upon in matters respecting the rights
   of our fellows? Why should we throw away the laws given to Moses by God
   himself, and have the audacity to make some of our own? How dare we drown
   the thunders of Sinai by calling the ayes and noes in a petty legislature?
   If reason can determine what is merciful, what is just, the duties of man
   to man, what more do we want either in time or in eternity?

   Down, forever down, with any religion that requires upon its ignorant
   altar the sacrifice of the goddess Reason, that compels her to abdicate
   forever the shining throne of the soul, strips from her form the imperial
   purple, snatches from her hand the scepter of thought and makes her the
   bond-woman of a senseless faith!

   If a man should tell you that he had the most beautiful painting in the
   world, and after taking you where it was should insist upon having your
   eyes shut, you would likely suspect, either that he had no painting or
   that it was some pitiable daub. Should he tell you that he was a most
   excellent performer on the violin, and yet refuse to play unless your ears
   were stopped, you would think, to say the least of it, that he had an odd
   way of convincing you of his musical ability. But would his conduct be any
   more wonderful than that of a religionist who asks that before examining
   his creed you will have the kindness to throw away your reason? The first
   gentleman says, "Keep your eyes shut, my picture will bear everything but
   being seen;" "Keep your ears stopped, my music objects to nothing but
   being heard." The last says, "Away with your reason, my religion dreads
   nothing but being understood."

   So far as I am concerned, I most cheerfully admit that most Christians are
   honest, and most ministers sincere. We do not attack them; we attack their
   creed. We accord to them the same rights that we ask for ourselves. We
   believe that their doctrines are hurtful. We believe that the frightful
   text, "He that believes shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be
   damned," has covered the earth with blood. It has filled the heart with
   arrogance, cruelty and murder. It has caused the religious wars; bound
   hundreds of thousands to the stake; founded inquisitions; filled dungeons;
   invented instruments of torture; taught the mother to hate her child;
   imprisoned the mind; filled the world with ignorance; persecuted the
   lovers of wisdom; built the monasteries and convents; made happiness a
   crime, investigation a sin, and self-reliance a blasphemy. It has poisoned
   the springs of learning; misdirected the energies of the world; filled all
   countries with want; housed the people in hovels; fed them with famine;
   and but for the efforts of a few brave Infidels it would have taken the
   world back to the midnight of barbarism, and left the heavens without a
   star.

   The malingers of Paine say that he had no right to attack this doctrine,
   because he was unacquainted with the dead languages; and for this reason,
   it was a piece of pure impudence in him to investigate the Scriptures.

   Is it necessary to understand Hebrew in order to know that cruelty is not
   a virtue, that murder is inconsistent with infinite goodness, and that
   eternal punishment can be inflicted upon man only by an eternal fiend? Is
   it really essential to conjugate the Greek verbs before you can make up
   your mind as to the probability of dead people getting out of their
   graves? Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his
   opinion as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God? Common
   sense belongs exclusively to no tongue. Logic is not confined to, nor has
   it been buried with, the dead languages. Paine attacked the Bible as it is
   translated. If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.

   The Christianity of Paine's day is not the Christianity of our time. There
   has been a great improvement since then. One hundred and fifty years ago
   the foremost preachers of our time would have perished at the stake. A
   Universalist would have been torn in pieces in England, Scotland, and
   America. Unitarians would have found themselves in the stocks, pelted by
   the rabble with dead cats, after which their ears would have been cut off
   their tongues bored, and their foreheads branded. Less than one hundred
   and fifty years ago the following law was in force in Maryland:

   "Be it enacted by the Right Honorable, the Lord Proprietor, by and with
   the advice and consent of his Lordship's governor, and the upper and lower
   houses of the Assembly, and the authority of the same:

   "That if any person shall hereafter, within this province, wittingly,
   maliciously, and advisedly, by writing or speaking, blaspheme or curse
   God, or deny our Savior, Jesus Christ, to be the Son of God, or shall deny
   the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any
   of the three persons, or the unity of the Godhead, or shall utter any
   profane words concerning the Holy Trinity, or any of the persons thereof,
   and shall thereof be convict by verdict, shall, for the last offence, be
   bored through the tongue, and fined twenty pounds to be levied of his
   body. And for the second offence, the offender shall be stigmatized by
   burning in the forehead with the letter B, and fined forty pounds. And
   that for the third offence the offender shall suffer death without the
   benefit of clergy."

   The strange thing about this law is, that it has never been repealed, and
   is still in force in the District of Columbia. Laws like this were in
   force in most of the colonies, and in all countries where the church had
   power.

   In the Old Testament, the death penalty was attached to hundreds of
   offenses. It has been the same in all Christian countries. To-day, in
   civilized governments, the death penalty is attached only to murder and
   treason: and in some it has been entirely abolished. What a commentary
   upon the divine systems of the world!

   In the day of Thomas Paine, the church was ignorant, bloody and
   relentless. In Scotland the "Kirk" was at the summit of its power. It was
   a full sister of the Spanish Inquisition. It waged war upon human nature.
   It was the enemy of happiness, the hater of joy, and the despiser of
   religious liberty. It taught parents to murder their children rather than
   to allow them to propagate error. If the mother held opinions of which the
   infamous "Kirk" disapproved, her children were taken from her arms, her
   babe from her very bosom, and she was not allowed to see them, or to write
   them a word. It would not allow shipwrecked sailors to be rescued from
   drowning on Sunday. It sought to annihilate pleasure, to pollute the heart
   by filling it with religious cruelty and gloom, and to change mankind into
   a vast horde of pious, heartless fiends. One of the most famous Scotch
   divines said: "The Kirk holds that religious toleration is not far from
   blasphemy." And this same Scotch Kirk denounced, beyond measure, the man
   who had the moral grandeur to say, "The world is my country, and to do
   good my religion." And this same Kirk abhorred the man who said, "Any
   system of religion that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true
   system."

   At that time nothing so delighted the church as the beauties of endless
   torment, and listening to the weak wailings of damned infants struggling
   in the slimy coils and poison-folds of the worm that never dies.

   About the beginning of the nineteenth century, a boy by the name of Thomas
   Aikenhead, was indicted and tried at Edinburgh for having denied the
   inspiration of the Scriptures, and for having, on several occasions, when
   cold, wished himself in hell that he might get warm. Notwithstanding the
   poor boy recanted and begged for mercy, he was found guilty and hanged.
   His body was thrown in a hole at the foot of the scaffold and covered with
   stones.

   Prosecutions and executions like this were common in every Christian
   country, and all of them were based upon the belief that an intellectual
   conviction is a crime.

   No wonder the church hated and traduced the author of the "Age of Reason."

   England was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony. All
   religious conceptions were of the grossest nature. The ideas of crazy
   fanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts. Milton had
   clothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods -- had
   added to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology. He gave to the
   Protestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity. He
   turned all the angels into soldiers -- made heaven a battlefield, put
   Christ in uniform, and described God as a militia general. His works were
   considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible itself, and
   the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the horrible
   imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.

   Heaven and hell were realities -- the judgment-day was expected -- books
   of account would be opened. Every man would hear the charges against him
   read. God was supposed to sit on a golden throne, surrounded by the
   tallest angels, with harps in their hands and crowns on their heads. The
   goats would be thrust into eternal fire on the left, while the orthodox
   sheep, on the right, were to gambol on sunny slopes forever and forever.

   The nation was profoundly ignorant, and consequently extremely religious,
   so far as belief was concerned.

   In Europe, Liberty was lying chained in the Inquisition -- her white bosom
   stained with blood. In the New World the Puritans had been hanging and
   burning in the name of God, and selling white Quaker children into slavery
   in the name of Christ, who said, "Suffer little children to come unto me."

   Under such conditions progress was impossible. Some one had to lead the
   way. The church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement.
   Religion always looks back. The church has already reduced Spain to a
   guitar, Italy to a hand-organ, and Ireland to exile.

   Some one not connected with the church had to attack the monster that was
   eating out the heart of the world. Some one had to sacrifice himself for
   the good of all. The people were in the most abject slavery; their manhood
   had been taken from them by pomp, by pageantry and power. Progress is born
   of doubt and inquiry.

   The church never doubts -- never inquires. To doubt is heresy -- to
   inquire is to admit that you do not know -- the church does neither.

   More than a century ago Catholicism, wrapped in robes red with the
   innocent blood of millions, holding in her frantic clutch crowns and
   scepters, honors and gold, the keys of heaven and hell, trampling beneath
   her feet the liberties of nations, in the proud moment of almost universal
   dominion, felt within her heartless breast the deadly dagger of Voltaire.
   From that blow the church never can recover. Livid with hatred she
   launched her eternal anathema at the great destroyer, and ignorant
   Protestants have echoed the curse of Rome.

   In our country the church was all-powerful, and although divided into many
   sects, would instantly unite to repel a common foe.

   Paine struck the first grand blow.

   The "Age of Reason" did more to undermine the power of the Protestant
   Church than all other books then known. It furnished an immense amount of
   food for thought. It was written for the average mind, and is a
   straightforward, honest investigation of the Bible, and of the Christian
   system.

   Paine did not falter, from the first page to the last. He gives you his
   candid thought, and candid thoughts are always valuable.

   The "Age of Reason" has liberalized us all. It put arguments in the mouths
   of the people; it put the church on the defensive; it enabled somebody in
   every village to corner the parson; it made the world wiser, and the
   church better; it took power from the pulpit and divided it among the
   pews.

   Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the church has lost
   power. There is no exception to this rule.

   No nation ever materially advanced that held strictly to the religion of
   its founders.

   No nation ever gave itself wholly to the control of the church without
   losing its power, its honor, and existence.

   Every church pretends to have found the exact truth. This is the end of
   progress. Why pursue that which you have? Why investigate when you know?

   Every creed is a rock in running water: humanity sweeps by it. Every creed
   cries to the universe, "Halt!" A creed is the ignorant Past bullying the
   enlightened Present.

   The ignorant are not satisfied with what can be demonstrated. Science is
   too slow for them, and so they invent creeds. They demand completeness. A
   sublime segment, a grand fragment, are of no value to them. They demand
   the complete circle -- the entire structure.

   In music they want a melody with a recurring accent at measured periods.
   In religion they insist upon immediate answers to the questions of
   creation and destiny. The alpha and omega of all things must be in the
   alphabet of their superstition. A religion that cannot answer every
   question, and guess every conundrum is, in their estimation, worse than
   worthless. They desire a kind of theological dictionary -- a religious
   ready reckoner, together with guide-boards at all crossings and turns.
   They mistake impudence for authority, solemnity for wisdom, and bathos for
   inspiration. The beginning and the end are what they demand. The grand
   flight of the eagle is nothing to them. They want the nest in which he was
   hatched, and especially the dry limb upon which he roosts. Anything that
   can be learned is hardly worth knowing. The present is considered of no
   value in itself. Happiness must not be expected this side of the clouds,
   and can only be attained by self-denial and faith; not self-denial for the
   good of others, but for the salvation of your own sweet self.

   Paine denied the authority of bibles and creeds; this was his crime, and
   for this the world shut the door in his face, and emptied its slops upon
   him from the windows.

   I challenge the world to show that Thomas Paine ever wrote one line, one
   word in favor of tyranny -- in favor of immorality; one line, one word
   against what he believed to be for the highest and best interest of
   mankind; one line, one word against justice, charity, or liberty, and yet
   he has been pursued as though he had been a fiend from hell. His memory
   has been execrated as though he had murdered some Uriah for his wife;
   driven some Hagar into the desert to starve with his child upon her bosom;
   defiled his own daughters; ripped open with the sword the sweet bodies of
   loving and innocent women; advised one brother to assassinate another;
   kept a harem with seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, or had
   persecuted Christians even unto strange cities.

   The church has pursued Paine to deter others. No effort has been in any
   age of the world spared to crush out opposition. The church used painting,
   music and architecture, simply to degrade mankind. But there are men that
   nothing can awe. There have been at all times brave spirits that dared
   even the gods. Some proud head has always been above the waves. In every
   age some Diogenes has sacrificed to all the gods. True genius never
   cowers, and there is always some Samson feeling for the pillars of
   authority.

   Cathedrals and domes, and chimes and chants -- temples frescoed and
   groined and carved, and gilded with gold -- altars and tapers, and
   paintings of virgin and babe -- censer and chalice -- chasuble, paten and
   alb -- organs, and anthems and incense rising to the winged and blest --
   maniple, amice and stole -- crosses and crosiers, tiaras and crowns --
   miters and missals and masses -- rosaries, relics and robes -- martyrs and
   saints, and windows stained as with the blood of Christ -- never, never
   for one moment awed the brave, proud spirit of the Infidel. He knew that
   all the pomp and glitter had been purchased with Liberty -- that priceless
   jewel of the soul. In looking at the cathedral he remembered the dungeon.
   The music of the organ was not loud enough to drown the clank of fetters.
   He could not forget that the taper had lighted the fagot. He knew that the
   cross adorned the hilt of the sword, and so where others worshiped, he
   wept and scorned.

   The doubter, the investigator, the Infidel, have been the saviors of
   liberty. This truth is beginning to be realized, and the truly
   intellectual are honoring the brave thinkers of the past.

   But the church is as unforgiving as ever, and still wonders why any
   Infidel should be wicked enough to endeavor to destroy her power.

   I will tell the church why.

   You have imprisoned the human mind; you have been the enemy of liberty;
   you have burned us at the stake -- wasted us upon slow fires -- torn our
   flesh with iron; you have covered us with chains -- treated us as
   outcasts; you have filled the world with fear; you have taken our wives
   and children from our arms; you have confiscated our property; you have
   denied us the right to testify in courts of justice; you have branded us
   with infamy; you have torn out our tongues; you have refused us burial. In
   the name of your religion, you have robbed us of every right; and after
   having inflicted upon us every evil that can be inflicted in this world,
   you have fallen upon your knees, and with clasped hands implored your God
   to torment us forever.

   Can you wonder that we hate your doctrines -- that we despise your creeds
   -- that we feel proud to know that we are beyond your power -- that we are
   free in spite of you -- that we can express our honest thought, and that
   the whole world is grandly rising into the blessed light?

   Can you wonder that we point with pride to the fact that Infidelity has
   ever been found battling for the rights of man, for the liberty of
   conscience, and for the happiness of all?

   Can you wonder that we are proud to know that we have always been
   disciples of Reason, and soldiers of Freedom; that we have denounced
   tyranny and superstition, and have kept our hands unstained with human
   blood?

   We deny that religion is the end or object of this life. When it is so
   considered it becomes destructive of happiness -- the real end of life. It
   becomes a hydra-headed monster, reaching in terrible coils from the
   heavens, and thrusting its thousand fangs into the bleeding, quivering
   hearts of men. It devours their substance, builds palaces for God, (who
   dwells not in temples made with hands,) and allows his children to die in
   huts and hovels. It fills the earth with mourning, heaven with hatred, the
   present with fear, and all the future with despair.

   Virtue is a subordination of the passions to the intellect. It is to act
   in accordance with your highest convictions. It does not consist in
   believing, but in doing. This is the sublime truth that the Infidels in
   all ages have uttered. They have handed the torch from one to the other
   through all the years that have fled. Upon the altar of Reason they have
   kept the sacred fire, and through the long midnight of faith they fed the
   divine flame.

   Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery. In every creed man is the
   slave of God -- woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are the
   slaves of all.

   We do not want creeds; we want knowledge -- we want happiness.

   And yet we are told by the church that we have accomplished nothing; that
   we are simply destroyers; that we tear down without building again.

   Is it nothing to free the mind? Is it nothing to civilize mankind? Is it
   nothing to fill the world with light, with discovery, with science? Is it
   nothing to dignify man and exalt the intellect? Is it nothing to grope
   your way into the dreary prisons, the damp and dropping dungeons, the dark
   and silent cells of superstition, where the souls of men are chained to
   floors of stone; to greet them like a ray of light, like the song of a
   bird, the murmur of a stream; to see the dull eyes open and grow slowly
   bright; to feel yourself grasped by the shrunken and unused hands, and
   hear yourself thanked by a strange and hollow voice?

   Is it nothing to conduct these souls gradually into the blessed light of
   day -- to let them see again the happy fields, the sweet, green earth, and
   hear the everlasting music of the waves? Is it nothing to make men wipe
   the dust from their swollen knees, the tears from their blanched and
   furrowed cheeks? Is it a small thing to reave the heavens of an insatiate
   monster and write upon the eternal dome, glittering with stars, the grand
   word -- FREEDOM?

   Is it a small thing to quench the flames of hell with the holy tears of
   pity -- to unbind the martyr from the stake -- break all the chains -- put
   out the fires of civil war -- stay the sword of the fanatic, and tear the
   bloody hands of the Church from the white throat of Science?

   Is it a small thing to make men truly free -- to destroy the dogmas of
   ignorance, prejudice and power -- the poisoned fables of superstition, and
   drive from the beautiful face of the earth the fiend of Fear?

   It does seem as though the most zealous Christian must at times entertain
   some doubt as to the divine origin of his religion. For eighteen hundred
   years the doctrine has been preached. For more than a thousand years the
   church had, to a great extent, the control of the civilized world, and
   what has been the result? Are the Christian nations patterns of charity
   and forbearance? On the contrary, their principal business is to destroy
   each other. More than five millions of Christians are trained, educated,
   and drilled to murder their fellow-christians. Every nation is groaning
   under a vast debt incurred in carrying on war against other Christians, or
   defending itself from Christian assault. The world is covered with forts
   to protect Christians from Christians, and every sea is covered with iron
   monsters ready to blow Christian brains into eternal froth. Millions upon
   millions are annually expended in the effort to construct still more
   deadly and terrible engines of death. Industry is crippled, honest toil is
   robbed, and even beggary is taxed to defray the expenses of Christian
   warfare. There must be some other way to reform this world. We have tried
   creed, and dogma and fable, and they have failed; and they have failed in
   all the nations dead.

   The people perish for the lack of knowledge.

   Nothing but education -- scientific education -- can benefit mankind. We
   must find out the laws of nature and conform to them.

   We need free bodies and free minds, -- free labor and free-thought, --
   chainless hands and fetterless brains. Free labor will give us wealth.
   Free thought will give us truth.

   We need men with moral courage to speak and write their real thoughts, and
   to stand by their convictions, even to the very death. We need have no
   fear of being too radical. The future will verify all grand and brave
   predictions. Paine was splendidly in advance of his time; but he was
   orthodox compared with the Infidels of to-day.

   Science, the great Iconoclast, has been busy since 1908, by the highway of
   Progress are the broken images of the Past.

   On every hand the people advance. The Vicar of God has been pushed from
   the throne of the Caesars, and upon the roofs of the Eternal City falls
   once more the shadow of the Eagle.

   All has been accomplished by the heroic few. The men of science have
   explored heaven and earth, and with infinite patience have furnished the
   facts. The brave thinkers have used them. The gloomy caverns of
   superstition have been transformed into temples of thought, and the demons
   of the past are the angels of to-day.

   Science took a handful of sand, constructed a telescope, and with it
   explored the starry depths of heaven. Science wrested from the gods their
   thunderbolts; and now, the electric spark, freighted with thought and
   love, flashes under all the waves of the sea. Science took a tear from the
   cheek of unpaid labor, converted it into steam, created a giant that turns
   with tireless arm, the countless wheels of toil.

   Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes -- one of the men to whom
   we are indebted. His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.
   As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and
   honored.

   He lived a long, laborious and useful life. The world is better for his
   having lived. For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and reproach for
   his portion. He ate the bitter bread of sorrow. His friends were untrue to
   him because he was true to himself, and true to them. He lost the respect
   of what is called society, but kept his own. His life is what the world
   calls failure and what history calls success.

   If to love your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was
   good.

   If to be in advance of your time -- to be a pioneer in the direction of
   right -- is greatness, Thomas Paine was great.

   If to avow your principles and discharge your duty in the presence of
   death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.

   At the age of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart. He died in the
   land his genius defended -- under the flag he gave to the skies. Slander
   cannot touch him now -- hatred cannot reach him more. He sleeps in the
   sanctuary of the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.

   A few more years -- a few more brave men -- a few more rays of light, and
   mankind will venerate the memory of him who said:

   "ANY SYSTEM OF RELIGION THAT SHOCKS THE MIND OF A CHILD CANNOT BE A TRUE
   SYSTEM;"

   "THE WORLD IS MY COUNTRY, AND TO DO GOOD MY RELIGION."
