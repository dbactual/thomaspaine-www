   No. Several authors
   have made a case for Paine being the author, but the mainstream of
   historians have dismissed it. What can be said is that *Common Sense*
   prepared the framework and indeed much of the specific language of the
   Declaration. *Common Sense* spurred most states, cities, towns and counties
   to write their own Declarations in the spring of 1776 using language
   contained in it. From that fact alone, we regard Common Sense as
   the founding document of the United States. (See Thomas Paine and the
   Declaration of Independence under About Paine/ Articles). HOWEVER, a recent discovery of a document places Paine in the room for its creation, with a position of authority. See The Truth Seeker (Sept. 2019) article on this document and its significance.
