   Our Association has not taken a position on this question. Several authors
   have made a case for Paine being the author, but the mainstream of
   historians have dismissed it. What can be said is that Common Sense
   prepared the framework and indeed much of the specific language of the
   Declaration. Common Sense spurred most states, cities, towns and counties
   to write their own Declarations in the spring of 1776 using language
   contained in Common Sense. From that fact alone, we regard Common Sense as
   the founding document of the United States. Whether Paine wrote or helped
   write the Declaration, itself, is an interesting topic that we will take
   up from both sides on this site in the future. (See Thomas Paine and the
   Declaration of Independence under About Paine/ Articles).
