   TPNHA note: William van der Weyde was President of the Thomas Paine
   National Historical Association from 1920 to 1929 when he died. Former
   U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt had made a famous slander against Paine,
   and van der Weyde was interested in getting a retraction. Aside from the
   historical interest, and the marvelous manner in which Van der Weyde
   finesses Roosevelt into replying, this correspondence also demonstrates
   some of the history of the slander campaign against Paine, and its
   political and religious roots. When they could not defeat the ideas, they
   attacked the man. The first attack on Paine's character came in March,
   1776 when an outraged reverend, in an attempt to defeat the recently
   published Common Sense, attacked the author's character when it was not
   even known who the author was. A series of personal slanders from Paine's
   political enemies has hounded his memory and legacy ever since, and
   historians to this day repeat the same nonsense that Roosevelt does in
   these letters, with the same lack of thought that Roosevelt evidenced.
   Roosevelt's pernicious slander was popularized just at the time, in the
   1880's, when Paine was gaining some recognition again. It took 30 years to
   get Roosevelt to account for his baseless accusations, and it was done in
   the following letters. Roosevelt died four months after the last letter
   was written. These letters are from the TPNHA archives, and first appeared
   in our Journal in 2000. To our knowledge the letters never made it into
   book form.
    
   Foreword by William van der Weyde
    
        The correspondence between Colonel Roosevelt and myself on the
   subject of Thomas Paine is in the main so directly to the point that an
   explanatory foreword is hardly necessary. There are nevertheless some
   matters touched upon in these letters concerning which a few additional
   words will be of value.
        In having the correspondence bound into book form for preservation I
   think it will be well to cover these points by a short introduction, and
   also, to briefly relate the history of Mr. Roosevelt's famous
   charactertzation of Thomas Paine as "a filthy little Atheist".
        In the 1888 first appeared Roosevelt's "Life of Gouverneur Morris",
   in which occurs his vehement and contemptuous denunciation of the great
   philosopher and libertarian. A storm of protest arose from admirers of
   Thomas Paine all over the world. Letters urging a retraction of the
   objectionable words reached Mr. Roosevelt from all lands. Mr. Roosevelt
   did not reply and did not retract. Magazines, newspapers and books quoted
   the unjust words and called upon the author for a withdrawal of his
   "three-word slander". The future President of the United States was
   content to maintain silence. In 1899, when Mr. Roosevelt was Governor of
   New York, a delegation visited Albany to try to induce him to retract. He
   refused to see his visitors. When, some years later, Mr. Roosevelt was
   President of the Unites States, another delegation journeyed to the White
   House in Washington with the same purpose in view. It was equally
   unsuccessful.
        In the course of the thirty years that have elapsed between the
   original publication of the libel on Thomas Paine and the time of Mr.
   Roosevelt's death, many hundreds of letters reached him urging a
   retraction.
        Curiously, not until the present correspondence took place, could Mr.
   Roosevelt be induced to break his long silence on the subject. A Mr.
   Hartmann evoked the first letter. Then I took the matter up, and the
   correspondence in this volume ensued. The correspondence comprises the
   only letters so far as I know that Mr. Roosevelt has written upon this
   vital and extremely interesting subject, with the exception of a brief
   letter to his friend, Owen Wister, dated September 20,1901, in which Mr.
   Roosevelt repeats the story about Paine in bed and alleges that "a swine
   in a sty was physically clean in comparison"! (vide Scribner's Magazine,
   June, 1920, p. 644)
        I think I may fairly attribute the abrupt termination of our very
   polite correspondence to my letter of July 15, 1918, which presented
   rather conclusive evidence that Thomas Paine was not filthy, but was,
   instead, scrupulously neat and clean. Also, I surmise that my
   correspondent did not appreciate my quotation to him of his own low
   estimate of Gouverneur Morris (an excerpt from his own biography of
   Morris); and I think besides that Mr. Roosevelt perceived the futility of
   writing further on a subject concerning which he knew little and regarding
   which I apparently knew much.
        In the very beginning of the correspondence Mr. Roosevelt
   acknowledged that Paine was a Deist, not an Atheist; but he stubbornly
   persisted in the exactness otherwise of his characterization of Paine.
        In his letter dated July 9th, 1918, however, he retracts the
   "quotation" which he had alleged was from the journal of Gouverneur
   Morris, and which he quoted in the letter to Mr. Hartmann that brought
   about this correspondence. Being unable to substantiate it, Mr. Roosevelt
   definitely says of his "quotation" that he "has made and shall make no
   further allusions to it and will not quote it." He added: "I have never
   used it in public and I have withdrawn the only two private quotations
   that I have made of it." As the two private quotations were presumably to
   me and to Mr. Hartmann, I wrote to Mr. Hartmann telling him of Mr.
   Roosevelt's letter and asking if he had received a retraction from Mr.
   Roosevelt. Mr. Hartmann promptly replied, saying that he had received no
   such retraction, nor any letter whatever from Mr. Roosevelt.
        Regarding the Jared Sparks assertion, quoted by Mr. Roosevelt in the
   letter dated April 19, 1918, (where it is incorrectly ascribed to Morris)
   that Thomas Paine's habits and personality were so disagreeable to the
   Monroes while he was a guest at their home in Paris (1794-5),
   necessitating their excluding him from the family and sending his meals to
   his own apartment, the simple truth and historic fact is that Paine was
   extremely ill in the home of James Monroe (the U.S. Minister who succeeded
   Gouverneur Morris after the latter's recall), and that he was there
   tenderly nursed by Mrs. Monroe herself, who very kindly had the invalid's
   meals sent to his sick-room, he being unable to come downstairs.
        In Mr. Roosevelt's letter of July 1, 1918, he refers to Paine being
   "in reality a French citizen," not a citizen of the United States,
   entirely disregarding the fact that James Monroe claimed Paine as an
   American citizen when he demanded from the French Government - and secured
   - his release from the Luxembourg, into which he had been cast, largely
   enough through the machinations of Gouverneur Morris, Paine's inveterate
   enemy. The same French decree (August 26,1792), by the way, that conferred
   on Paine the complimentary title of French citizen, conferred the same
   title on George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, Kosciuszko,
   Joseph Priestley, David Williams and a dozen others.
        This allegation by Mr. Roosevelt and a number of others that I might
   easily have controverted, I did not trouble to dispute because my subject
   was solely whether or not Paine was "a filthy little Atheist". Mr.
   Roosevelt having admitted that Paine was not an Atheist, I devoted my
   letters entirely to the question of his filthiness or cleanliness.

        I am sorry Mr. Roosevelt has passed away without retracting fully and
   frankly his unwarranted slander of the great man who did so much in the
   founding of the United States of America. I am indeed not sorry for the
   sake of Thomas Paine. His fame is too secure to be injured by calumny and
   vituperation. It is for the sake and for the reputation of Mr. Roosevelt
   that I have regrets.

    

   Letter from S.E. Hartmann of the Rationalist Press Association to Theodore
   Roosevelt,
   October 8, 1917:
    
   Theodore Roosevelt, Esq.
   Oyster Bay
   Long Island, NY
    
   Dear Sir,
        As to one of the distinguished citizens of the United States,
   althought (sic) unknown, I am writing you this letter. Some days ago I
   passed 23rd Street and fourth(sic) Avenue, and listened to one of the soap
   box orators who mentioned your name in a manner I must admit shocked me.
        You will excuse the language but I am repeating what he said, word
   for word: "Theodore Roosevelt is the man who told three lies in three
   words, when he called Thomas Paine, "Dirty, little Atheist", first Thomas
   Paine was a very clean man, second he was six feet tall, and third, he was
   a deist for he wrote, on the first page of his "Age of Reason"," I believe
   in one God and no more and I hope for future life."
        Some days later it happened that I came to the same corner and a
   different soap box orator assailed you with the same story.
        If the trouble is not to (sic) much will you be good enough to refute
   their statement as a mischievious (sic) lie.
        I think that it is a shame that these soap box orators are allowed to
   be-smere (sic) the name and character of a citizen and an ex-president of
   this republic.
    
   Thanking you in advance for your response,
   Yours sincerely,
   S.E. Hartmann
    
   Letter of Theodore Roosevelt to S.E. Hartmann, October 23, 1917:
    
   My dear Mr. Hartmann,
    
   letter is private and not for publication.
    
        The statement refers to a quotation from Gouverneur Morris' Journal
   while he was Minister to France, during the French Revolution. He visited
   Paine, and found him in bed, not having left it for a week, for the
   purposes of nature, altho (sic) seemingly entirely able to do so.
        If "filthy" does not describe such conduct, no word can. Of course he
   was a deist, not an atheist. It would be nonsense to answer a soap-box
   orator.
    
   Sincerely yours,
   Theodore Roosevelt
    
   Letter of Willium van der Weyde to Theodore Roosevelt, March 31, 1918:
    
   My dear Col. Roosevelt,
        I am interested in the Gouverneur Morris-Thomas Paine matter and have
   recently seen your letter to Mr. Hartmann, of East Orange, in which you
   say: "The statement refers to a quotation from Gouverneur Morris' journal
   while he was Minister to France, during the French Revolution. He visited
   Paine, and found him in bed, not having left it for a week, for the
   purposes of nature, altho seemingly entirely able to do so." etc.
        I do not find the reference in The Diary and Letters of Gouverneur
   Morris, edited by Anne Gray Morris, 2 vols, (Scribner's, 1888.) but it is
   possible that I have overlooked it.
        Will you be so good as to let me know if I have been looking in the
   right books, and, if not to what volume I should refer?
    
   Yours very truly,
   Thanking you in advance for the courtesy of your reply, I am
   W.M. van der Wevde

   Letter of Theodore Roosevelt to William van der Weyde, April 19, 1918
    
   The Kansas City Star
   New York Office
   347 Madison Avenue
   Office of Theodore Roosevelt
    
   My dear Mr. Van der Weyde,
    
   The book in which the statement to which you refer occurs, was written by
   me thirty years ago. I have forgotten now whether the details of Paine's
   actions were set forth in manuscript or in a complete edition of his
   letters and journals. Spark's Morris is the only one I have at hand. If
   you will turn to Vol. 1, pages 416-l8, you will see the following
   statements: "He had become disgusting in his person and deportment for
   several months he lived in Mr. Monroe's house, but so intemperate were his
   habits and so disagreeable his person that it was necessary to exclude him
   from the family and send his meals to his own apartments."  I need hardly
   say that this absolutely justifies and requires the use of the adjective I
   did in fact use in order to describe Paine's person and habits. Instead of
   atheist, however, I should have used the term deist. Atheist would have
   been the proper term if I had been dealing with the Thirteenth Century,
   for
   example; but in the Eighteenth Century the word deist had come into use to
   describe the men who denied the existence of the God of revealed religion,
   whereas atheist was a man who denied the existence of any God. Even in the
   16th and l7th centuries the terms were sometimes used interchangeably.
        Will you kindly send a copy of this letter to the gentleman who wrote
   you, stating to him, however that as I wrote him confidentially I do not
   desire him to make any further use of the letter I sent. I also request
   that this letter be treated as purely confidential. I send it merely
   because your own letter was so courteous that I am glad to answer you. But
   I do not desire or intend to be drawn into any kind of public controversy
   on the subject; it could not by any possibility result in any benefit. I
   wish to repeat that the quotations I give from Sparks, Morris amply
   warrant my using the adjective I did. If I were writing now I should use
   the word deist instead of atheist; but this is certainly not a matter of
   sufficient importance to warrant any
   re-opening of the question. I have expressed the reasons for my judgment
   on various public men. It is out of the question for me to re-open the
   matters as regards these public men, unless new material is given me; and
   such is not the case in the present instance. Nor have I time for such
   discussions now.
    
   Faithfully yours,
   Theodore Roosevelt
    
   Letter of William van der Weyde to Theodore Roosevelt, May 25, 1918:
    
   My dear Col. Roosevelt:
    
        I have only just now received your letter of April 19th in re
   Gouverneur Morris - Thomas Paine, having been out of town for several
   weeks.
        I note by the newspapers that just at this time you are out of town
   yourself on a speech-making tour, so I shall defer replying to your
   courteous letter until you are back in the city.
        I wish at present merely to acknowledge receipt of your letter, to
   thank you for it, and to explain why an acknowledgement was not sooner
   sent.
        I mail this to The Metropolitan office with request on envelope that
   it be forwarded.
    
   Sincerely yours,
   W.M. van der Weyde
    
   Letter of William van der Weyde to Theodore Roosevelt, June 24, 1918:
    
   My dear Col. Roosevelt:
    
        On May 25 I sent you a brief note acknowledging receipt of your
   letter and saying I would defer a reply until your return from the
   speech-making tour that the newspapers announced. Now that you are back
   and at your home in Oyster Bay I am sending to you - by express - a copy
   of Moncure Conway's Life of Thomas Paine, containing a couple of chapters
   on the Paine-Morris matter which I think have hitherto escaped your
   notice, and which will surely interest you.
        In the closing paragraph of your letter to me dated April 19, you
   indicated willingness to revise your judgment "were new material given
   you"; "such", you added, however, "is not the case in the present
   instance."
        In the volume I send you not only will you find "new material" but
   conclusive documentary evidence from the French National Archives in
   Paris, not brought to light until within comparatively recent years. The
   evidence is presented in the chapter entitled "A Minister and His
   Prisoner".
        I trust that you will be sufficiently interested to read the entire
   book. It is well worth reading, being the work of a very careful,
   conscientious and unbiased biographer, with whose rank as an American
   historian you are, of course, familiar.
        The work of Jared Sparks was published in 1832, at a time when many
   facts about Paine and Morris had not come to light, and when there was a
   strong religious prejudice against Paine
        There is additional material on the Paine-Morris matter in Volume
   III, Chap. 21, of the Writings of Thomas Paine, edited by Moncure Conway,
   with an important introduction by the Editor. This chapter includes
   quotations from Sparks. I shall be glad to send you this volume, too,
   should you care to see it.
        I think, Mr. Roosevelt, that you are broad-minded and just, and I
   feel that new evidence being presented to you, you will be only glad to
   revise your earlier judgment of Paine.
        I am in no great hurry for the return of the book I am sending you.
   Anytime within six weeks or so is quite all right. When you send it back
   please do so by express, at my expense.
        May I ask you in the meantime to kindly acknowledge receipt of the
   book and this letter when they reach you?
    
   Sincerely yours,
   W.M. van der Weyde
    
   Letter of Theodore Roosevelt to William van der Weyde, July I, 1918:
    
   The Kansas City Star
   New York Office
   347 Madison Avenue
   Office of Theodore Roosevelt
    
   My dear Mr. Van der Weyde:
    
   I appreciate your letter and I appreciate your having sent me Conway's
   "Paine", which I return herewith. Now, my dear Mr. Van der Weyde, all this
   illuminates exactly why it is so difficult to go into a brief (private or
   public) argument on a matter which is really connected with the
   fundamental questions of history. The matter about Paine appeared in a
   book written by me some thirty years ago. I think I have said to you
   already, I ought to have used the word deist and not atheist in writing of
   the 18'n century. These terms have different values in different
   centuries. Deist, for instance, was unknown in the thirteenth century when
   any man who denied the existence of the Christian God was called an
   atheist, unless, as was most common, he was lumped with Mohammedans, Jews
   and heretics, and styled an infidel. I knew Conway personally. I know his
   writings somewhat. I do not know them better because I am entirely out of
   sympathy with them, and profoundly distrust his power of accurate
   statement. I think his views on most points of history absolutely wrong,
   and his judgments worse than unsafe. In the very chapters to which you
   refer me he takes almost Paine's view of Washington, and himself attacks
   Washington vigorously for his attitude toward the French Revolution, and
   completely misstates Washington's position toward Great Britain. In the
   same chapters his accusations against Morris are absurd. For example, one
   of Monroe's letters which he quotes, itself shows that Paine was in
   reality a French citizen; and, of course, it is nonsense to take any other
   view of a man who was an active member of the Girondist Party in the
   Legislative body which at the time represented the supreme government of
   France. As for the statement by Morris, and by Monroe as quoted by Sparks,
   concerning the filthy personal habits of Paine, Mr. Conway does not
   contradict it save by inference and does not produce one particle of proof
   to upset it.
        Under these conditions to go into an argument upon the question that
   you raise, my dear Mr. Van der Weyde, would mean the writing of a very
   large book; nor would it be necessary only to write one book, for I should
   have to write another as to why I think Washington, and not Washington's
   enemies such as Paine , took the right position as regards the
   international questions of the day. It would be necessary for me to
   explain at length why I think the kind of language that Paine used about
   Christianity and the Bible was improper and unworthy, when compared with
   the language which Huxley, for example, used. I am abusy man. I haven't
   the time to write volumes on every point where I differ from friends or
   from strangers concerning historical figures. My own view is that sound
   students of history and politics must come to the conclusion that
   Washington was immensely right, and Paine immensely wrong, during the
   decade which included Paine's residence as a Revolutionary in Paris. My
   judgment is also that even from the standpoint of men who do not accept
   the Orthodox view of revealed religion, Huxley was right and Paine wrong
   in their methods of treatment of the subject. But nothing whatever is to
   be gained by any public thrashing over of this subject. I haven't the time
   for it and I shall not deal with it further. If I did so in the case of
   Paine, I might just as well do so in the cases of Jefferson, of Monroe, of
    Calhoun, of Jefferson Davis, of the abolitionists, of the Secessionists,
   etc., etc., etc. This letter is for your personal information and in no
   way for publication.
    
   Sincerely yours,
   Theodore Roosevelt
    
   Letter of William van der Weyde to Theodore Roosevelt, July 6, 1918:
    
   My dear Col. Roosevelt:
    
        Please accept my thanks for your letter of July I and for the return
   of the Conway Life of Thomas Paine.
        Yes, I was aware that your appraisement of Paine as a "filthy little
   Atheist" occurred in the book you wrote some thirty years ago - the Life
   of Gouvernour Morris. I have had a copy of the work for many years and am
   quite familiar with it. As you say, you should,of course, have written
   Deist instead of Atheist. Paine was a profound believer in God, and his
   Age of Reason was written because, as he says in his letter to Samuel
   Adams, "the people of France were running headlong into Atheism, and he
   wished to "fix them to the first article of every man's creed who has any
   creed at all, I believe in God."
        Regarding the appellation "filthy" you wrote that "the statement
   refers to a quotation from Gouverneur Morris's journal while he was
   Minister to France during the French Revolution. He visited Paine and
   found him in bed, not having left it for a week for purposes of nature,
   altho (sic) seemingly entirely able to do so. If filthy does not describe
   such conduct, no word can."
        On April4 you wrote me "the quotation appears in Sparks' Life and
   Writings of Gouverneur Morris."
        The statement in Sparks's Morris to which you referred in your letter
   of April 19 (Volume I, page 416-l8) and which you were so kind as to copy
   for me, is a totally different thing, and not a quotation from the journal
   or writings of Morris, but comment by the Rev. Jared Sparks, editor of
   Morris's Journal.
        In Sparks's work, which I have at hand, I cannot locate Morris's
   statement about visiting Paine and finding him in bed, etc. I am curious
   to know if this episode refers to the time Paine was in the Luxembourg
   Prison' or subsequently, when he was a guest at Monroe's home. I would
   like to locate the quotation in Sparks's book and would be grateful to you
   for information as to just where it may be found in that interesting work.
        Please accept my thanks in advance for furnishing me this data.
    
   Sincerely yours,
   W.M. van der Weyde
    
   Letter of Theodore Roosevelt to William van der Weyde, July 9, 1918:
    
   The Kansas City Star
   New York Office
   347 Madrson Avenue
   Office of Theodore Roosevelt
    
   My dear Mr. Van der Weyde:
    
   Evidently one of my letters to you went astray. I wrote you three or four
   weeks ago giving the exact quotations from Sparks, which you have seen.
   The quotation I first sent you was from some manuscript writings of Morris
   which were submitted to me some thirty years ago (I am now not able to
   identify them; indeed, I am not sure that they were in manuscript instead
   of in print) and as I have no time to look up the matter, I have made and
   shall make no further allusions to it, and shall not quote it. I have
   never used it in public and I have withdrawn the only two private
   quotations that I made of it. The statements in Sparks to which you refer
   completely justify my published statement.
    
   Sincerely yours,
   Theodore Roosevelt
    
   Letter of William van der Weyde to Theodore Roosevelt, July 15, 1918:
    
   Col. Theodore Roosevelt
   Oyster Bay, N.Y.
    
   My dear Col. Roosevelt:
    
        Thank you for your letter of July 9. I am glad that you will not
   again use as a quotation from the journal of Gouverneur Morris the words
   regarding Paine's "filthy condition" which you quoted to me in the
   beginning of our little correspondence, and that you have withdrawn the
   only two quotations that you have made of it (presumably to me and Mr.
   Hartmann.)
        Yes, I received the letter in which you so kindly transcribed for me
   the paragraphs concerning Paine which occur in Jared Sparks's Life and
   Writings of Gouverneur Morris (Vol.I pp. 416-18) and in my last letter,
   dated July 6, I thanked you, but called your attention to the fact that
   the passages to which you referred are not really quotations from the
   journal of Morris, but are plainly the comments (no quotation marks) of
   the editor, Sparks. The Rev. Jared Sparks was not personally acquainted
   with Paine and was, without a shadow of doubt, biased in his opinions by
   religious prejudice.
        In your last letter you say "The statements in Sparks to which you
   refer, (Vol. I, pp.416-18) completely justify my published statement." I
   am afraid I shall have to differ with you in this particular, for the
   reasons given in the above paragraph.
        Even were the statements those of Morris, instead of allegations by
   Sparks, I should be inclined to doubt their reliability for the reason
   that Morris's character was not above reproach, as one may gather from
   your own estimate of Morris, as expressed in your Life of Gouverneur
   Morris. You tell how "Morris actually advocated repudiating our war debt,"
   and you remark that "no greenback demagogue of the lowest type ever
   advocated a proposition more dishonest and more contemptible." You also
   say of Morris, "he sneered at the words union and constitution as being
   meaningless:" "he strongly advocated secession" and "throughout the War of
   1812 appeared as the open champion of treason to the nation." etc., etc.
        At the time (1887) that you wrote the Life of Gouverneur Morris in
   which your reference to Thomas Paine as a "filthy little Atheist" occurs,
   there was no good biography of Paine to which you might refer for
   information, but there were several scurrilous books purporting to be
   biographies of Paine, which were in fact merely mediums for the defamation
   of a man who had incurred political and theologic hatred.  Even the
   biographic encyclopedias of that period - thirty-one years ago--reprinted
   as historic fact the various calumnies about Paine that had long passed
   current, thus perpetuating what is now known to be merely slander of the
   dead.
        Your estimate of Paine as "filthy" and as an "Atheist" was, no doubt,
   founded on the only information available to you at that time - the
   scurrilous "biographies" to which I refer, and the attempts at
   belittlement by Morris, who was extremely jealous of Paine and who had
   reason to fear exposure if Paine were released from the Luxembourg.
        Paine was not an "Atheist", as you now admit, but also he was not
   "filthy."
        Paine was the friend and companion of persons that would hardly have
   had a filthy man for an associate. Among Paine's friends in America were
   Franklin, Jefferson, Washington, Madison, Monroe, Dr. Benjamin Rush,
   Richard Henry Lee, Robert R. Livingston, Henry Laurens, Albert Gallatin,
   Genl. Nathaniel Greene, Lewis Morris and Robert Morris, Burr and Hamilton.
   These are but a few of his circle of friends of American Revolutionary
   days. They are not people that would consort with a man who was filthy.
        Paine's circle of friends when he was in Europe included many of the
   most eminent persons in England and France, such people as M. and Mme.
   Lafayette, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, J . Horne Tooke, M . and Mme. Brissot,
   Charles James Fox, George Romney, Robert Fulton, Major General James
   Jackson, Dr. Joseph Priestley, Herault de Sechelles, Thomas Clio Rickman,
   Mary Wollstonecraft, Thomas Erskine, Joel Barlow and Doctor Thomas Cooper.
   These are hardly the names of people who would make a friend of and
   entertain a man who was filthy.
        The portraits of Paine, painted by the most eminent artists of
   America, England and France, the earliest by Charles Wilson Peale (within
   a year or two of Paine's arrival in America,) and the last by John Wesley
   Jarvis (within a year or two of his death), all show Paine to have been
   scrupulously neat and clean, both in his dress and person. Other eminent
   painters whose portraits of Paine also bear witness to his cleanliness are
   George Romney, Gen'l John Trumbull and F. de Bonneville.
        In the archives of the Thomas Paine National Historical
   Association,(of which I have the honor of being a member,) there is a mass
   of testimony as to Paine's cleanliness of person and habits- all at your
   disposal if you wish to see it. Were my letter not already far longer than
   I had intended I would include some of this testimony
        The fables about Paine promulgated in the scurrilous "biographies" of
   the long ago are now known to be pure mythology, created only for
   political and theological purposes. In the past quarter of a century the
   real Paine has emerged from the mass of misrepresentation to shine as one
   of the illustrious of names.
        Walt Whitman, referring to the calumnies of Paine, wrote this:
   "Paine was double damnably lied about. Anything lower, meaner, more
   contemptible, I cannot imagine; to take an aged man - a man tired to death
   after a complicated life of toil, struggle, anxiety, - weak, dragged-down,
   at death's door; ...... then to pull him into the mud, distort everything
   he does and says; oh, it's infamous.
        "Thomas Paine had a noble personality, as exhibited in presence,
   face, voice, dress, manner, and what may be called his atmosphere and
   magnetism, especially the later years of his life. I am sure of it, of the
   foul and foolish fictions yet told about the circumstances of his decease,
   the absolute fact is that he lived a good life, after its kind; he died
   calmly and philosophically, as became him."
        I am confidant, Mr. Roosevelt, that as a fair-minded man and as an
   American historian, you wish only to have the exact and the entire truth,
   and that only the presentation of evidence is needed to have you revise
   your earlier judgment that Paine was filthy.
        Is the evidence herein presented convincing to you that Paine was not
   filthy? If not quite sufficient I shall be glad to dig out from the Paine
   Association's archives, and present to you, additionally, the testimony of
   Thomas Paine's associates through many years.
    
   Sincerely yours,
   W.M. van der Weyde

   My dear Col. Roosevelt:
    
        Since I have not heard from you in reply to my last letter, dated
   July 15, I think that perhaps my communication (addressed to Oyster Bay,)
   went astray in the mails and did not reach you.
       My letter contained evidence in the Paine matter that I am sure would
   interest you, as an American historian. Luckily, I kept a copy of the
   letter and this I would be glad to forward to you if the original letter
   was lost.
        Knowing of your bereavement I have not expected, nor wished, a prompt
   response, and I write now only with the idea that my letter may have
   miscarried, and to say that I shall be very glad to have your reply when
   you feel able to take the matter up.
        I am glad to note in the newspapers that you are again enjoying good
   health.
    
   Sincerely yours,
   W.M. van der Weyde

   Office of Theodore Roosevelt
    
   My dear Mr. Van der Weyde:
    
   I have answered every letter I have received from you; but now, my dear
   sir, you must excuse my saying that I cannot correspond any longer with
   you or anyone else concerning Mr. Thomas Paine. I do not think you
   understand how busy I am. This is the last letter I shall write in the
   matter. Your letters to me showed such good spirit that I was betrayed
   into going into a correspondence which has evidently been utterly useless.
   What I wrote of Thomas Paine in the book to which you refer, over thirty
   years ago, contains the substantial truth; and whether or not I would now
   tell it in quite the same language does not matter. The only alteration I
   would make, in the interest of a rather meticulous correctness of
   terminology, would be in the use of the word deist instead of atheist.
   However, the word atheist is probably also correct. This you will see if
   you will turn to the Life of Huxley, by his son, and read Huxley's letter
   to Kingsley in the
   year 1863. He there explicitly states that in his view, according to the
   customary terminology, and probably according to legal construction, the
   word atheist could be used to describe him, Huxley. I should myself, of
   course, describe Huxley as an agnostic rather than as either an atheist or
   a deist.
        You understand that our correspondence has been private and is not to
   be published. The utter uselessness of such a discussion, either private
   or public, is shown by the fact that after having been forced to take up a
   good deal of my time in answering your queries, I see no reason whatever
   to make the slightest change in my statement, except as above indicated.
   But this is not all. As regards most historical questions there is always
   room for a difference of opinion. I take Macauley's view of Marlborough
   and Penn for instance. I have said so in my published works. Perhaps you
   take directly the opposite view of both. But it would be an utter
   absurdity for me to go into a long discussion with you about our
   respective views of Marlborough and Penn. It is exactly as much an
   absurdity to have my time taken up in such a discussion about Paine.
    
   Very sincerely yours,
   Theodore Roosevelt
   Letter of William van der Weyde to Theodore Roosevelt, August 29, 1918:
    
   Col. Theodore Roosevelt
   Sagamore Hill
   Oyster Bay, N.Y.
    
   My dear Colonel Roosevelt:
    
   I know you would not wish to bring our little correspondence to a close
   with the omission of a reply to my letter of July 15, especially as your
   favor of August 21, which I received yesterday says "I have answered every
   letter I have received from you." This statement quite convinces me that
   my letter of July 15 did not reach you, for that letter remains
   unanswered.
        As this letter (July 15) contains important evidence on the subject
   regarding which we corresponded, I feel sure you will be glad to have a
   duplicate, and I take pleasure therefore in enclosing a copy.
        The letter I have just received from you, dealing only with the
   matter of Deist and Atheist, no reference being made to the claim that
   Paine was "filthy" - this latter being the entire subject matter of my
   letter - impresses me with the idea that my July 15th letter certainly
   went astray in the mails.
        You will be interested, I am sure, in the evidence concerning Paine
   which is presented in the enclosed letter (copy dated July 15.)
        Although your letter tells me you cannot continue the correspondence
   about Paine, I hardly think you will wish to end with my most important
   communication on the subject unanswered.
   I trust that after reading the letter of July l5 you will favor me with
   your opinion. Then I shall have had a reply to all of my letters.
    
   Sincerely yours,
   W.M. van der Weyde
    
   P.S. - Yes, I have the Life of Huxley, by his son, Leonard, and have found
   great pleasure in reading it. It is an extremely interesting and
   authoritative work by a most competent biographer.

   The Kansas City Star
   New York Office

   Office of Theodore Roosevelt
    
   Dear Mr. Van der Weyde:
    
   Colonel Roosevelt does not see that there is anything he can add to what
   he has written and it is not possible for him to go further into the
   matter.
    
   With regret.
   Sincerely yours,
   J.M. Stricker.
   Secretary.
