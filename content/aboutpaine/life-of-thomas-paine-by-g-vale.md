                                    PREFACE.

   There are four lives of Mr. Thomas Paine now extant; but none in print in
   the United States. Francis Oldys, or a person under that name, wrote a
   life of Mr. Paine about the year 1792, while Mr. Paine was yet alive, and
   active in the progress of the French Revolution. This life was written in
   fact by George Chalmers, one of the clerks of the Board of Plantation, at
   the instigation of Lord Hawksbury, afterward Lord Liverpool, for which he
   gave him five hundred pounds. Mr. Chalmers acknowledged the authorship of
   this book. This we have never seen; it has sunk into oblivion; it partly
   served the political purpose for which it was written, but the enemies of
   Mr. Paine and the Rights of Man were too prudent to endorse its
   acknowledged calumnies, and identify themselves with this transaction.

   Immediately after the death of Paine, Cheetham wrote his life in 1809.
   Cheetham was an Englishman and had been a zealous disciple of Paine, both
   in politics and religion; but he had retrograded in politics, and deserted
   the principles of the democratic party; Paine had attacked him with his
   accustomed force, and thus converted him into a personal enemy. Mr.
   Cheetham at this time edited a party paper (the Citizen) in New York, and
   while he was yet smarting under the lash of Paine, heated by party
   politics, and fired with revenge, like the ass in the fable, he kicked,
   not indeed the dying, but the dead lion, by writing the life of his
   adversary. Cheetham, however, connected this with a scheme of interest;
   for, becoming the deadly enemy of democracy, and losing the support of his
   old friends (for he was turned out of the Tammany society), he was
   preparing to go to Europe, and enlist in support of the tory government in
   England, by publishing a paper opposed to Cobbett, who had just come out
   in opposition to the government; and Cheetham apparently meant this life
   of Paine as a passport to the British treasury favor: at least, such was
   the opinion of the intimate friend of Cheetham, Mr. Charles Christian, who
   gave this relation to Mr. John Fellows and others, whom we have seen, and
   from whom we have learned this fact. This life of Paine, the only one
   published in the United States, abounds in calumnies, and after a lapse of
   some years caused the production of two other lives, one by Clio Rickman,
   the intimate friend of Mr. Paine for many years, and another by Mr. W. T.
   Sherwin, both published in London. Mr. Rickman was an excellent, amiable
   man, of the quaker profession, with whom Mr. Paine lived both in England
   and France, at different periods, and with whom he kept up a constant
   correspondence. The life of Paine, however, by Mr. Rickman, is sullied by
   a little vanity; he is to Paine, what Boswell was to Johnson. We are
   indebted to Mr. Rickman for many facts on which we can rely; but with the
   best intentions he was not the man to do Mr. Paine justice.

   The best life of Paine before published, is that of Sherwin; and from this
   life we shall freely extract. But Mr. Sherwin is incorrect on some points,
   and his whole work is so exclusively adapted to a London reader, that it
   is deteriorated for this market. Mr. Paine changed public opinion in favor
   of a republic at the time of the Revolution; his earliest energies were in
   favor of American liberty; it was here that his mighty powers were first
   developed, and here his political principles took root. His success in the
   United States brought him out in Europe; and his "Rights of Man," which
   shook the corrupt government of England, and endeared him to all France
   and every friend of liberty, was based upon his "Common Sense," which had
   concentrated public opinion in favor of a declaration of independence. And
   when the buds of liberty were nipped in England and France, to this
   country Mr. Paine retired, as his proper home, at the invitation of
   Jefferson, then the president, and avowedly the greatest and best
   statesman this country has known. And here, too, he died in peace, in a
   good old age, the firm and consistent friend of liberty. To this country,
   then, in a special manner belongs his life; here are his most numerous
   friends and personal acquaintances; it is here that the calumnies
   propagated by Cheetham may be effectually rebutted, by living witnesses
   yet in the sound possession of their faculties; and it is here that Paine
   can be identified with every crisis in the glorious Revolution which gave
   birth to this nation, Which has set the glorious example of republicanism,
   whose principles are now progressing in the world. The want of a life thus
   identifying Mr. Paine with the glories of our Revolution, is our apology
   for our present undertaking.

   The life of Paine by Cheetham has had a considerable influence; for though
   his calumnies are palpable, and his motives in publishing them apparent,
   he has given to them a degree of credibility by the free use of names,
   which the reader necessarily concludes are respectable references for the
   facts he has stated; fortunately, however, a public trial, in which he was
   convicted of libel, showed the shallow foundation on which his slander
   rested, and our acquaintance with some of the persons to whom he refers,
   enables us flatly to contradict these statements, and to denounce him on
   the very authority of many of his references as the utterer of gross
   falsehoods, to which he attached without their consent their names. With
   much ingenuity he relates a slander as a matter of fact, as if there were
   abundance of evidence, and apparently refers to the only source of this
   slander, as if this formed but a small part of his proof. Thus he declared
   Madame Bonneville to be the mistress of T. Paine, as if that fact were
   notorious; he produces no proof, but inserts a letter from Mr. W. Carver,
   written in anger, after a quarrel, in which such an insinuation is made,
   merely from the fact of that lady bringing her family to America, and
   leaving her husband in France. Madame Bonneville prosecuted Cheetham for
   this assertion, and Cheetham on that trial produced no other evidence than
   Carver and his angry letter. His counsel admitted the falseness of the
   charge, and pleaded only the insinuation in Carver's letter as justifying
   Cheetham as an historian to repeat the slander.

   This trial excited great interest at the time. The press generally
   reported it; and the brief faets with the counsel's speech have been
   preserved in a pamphlet form, from which pamphlet we shall give the
   introduction and a few extracts as pertinent to our object: -

                              [the Introduction.]

   "One James Cheetham, a man who had once been an editor of a republican
   paper in New York; had abandoned his past professions, and become the
   advocate of the British party in America. Among other means to serve them,
   he undertook to write the life of Thomas Paine, author of' Common Sense,
   'Rights of Man,' &c., &c. In this biography, he introduced the name of
   Madame Bonneville, a virtuous and respectable lady, the wife of N.
   Bonneville of Paris. He charged her with prostitution; said Paine was her
   paramour, and that one of her sons had the features, countenance, and
   temper of Thomas Paine. For this atrocious attack on the character of
   Madame Bonneville, and outrage to her feelings, Mr. Cheetham was indicted
   for a libel, and on the 19th of June, 1810, his trial was brought on.

   The counsel for the libeller took two grounds of defence: a

   1st. That the facts charged were true.

   2d. That the defendant was an HistoriAn, and, as such, had a right to
   publish what he had heard and believed, though it reflected on an innocent
   person.

   The first position was, after a contemptible effort to support it,
   abandoned even by the libeller's counsel. They were ashamed of it
   themselves. Several ladies of the first distinction, whose daughters had
   been intrusted to the care of Madame Bonneville, to learn the French
   language, appeared in court, and attested to the unblemished character of
   this much injured female.

   The counsel for the libeller than had recourse to their last ground, and
   strenuously maintained the principle they had laid down. They perhaps felt
   confidence in the court, as it had, in an early stage of the trial,
   intimated an opinion favorable to the new and extravagant pretension,
   which set up a libeller under the title of an historian. Nor was this
   confidence misplaced. Mr. Recorder Hoffman directed the jury, that if they
   should be of opinion, that Mr. Cheetham had been informed of what he
   wrote, and believed it, he was justified, and that, though Madame
   Bonneville was an innocent woman, they were authorized to acquit Mr.
   Cheethnm. He also read the letter of a man, by the name of Carver, as a
   justification of the libeller, though his counsel had not mentioned it.

   This monstrous doctrine, which leads to the prostration of private
   reputation, if not to the dissolution of civil society, was promptly
   rejected by the jury, although composed of men of different political
   sentiments, who returned in a few minutes a verdict of guilty.

   The court, however, when the libeller came up the next day to receive his
   sentence, highly commended the book which contained the libellous
   publication, declared that it tended to serve the cause of religion, and
   imposed no other punishment on the libeller, than the payment of two
   hundred and fifty dollars, with a direction that the costs be taken out of
   it.

   It is fit to remark, lest foreigners who are unacquainted with our
   political condition, should receive erroneous impressions, that Mr.
   Recorder Hoffman does not belong to what is called the republican party in
   America, but has been elevated to office by men in hostility to it, who
   obtained a temporary ascendency in the councils of the state."

   EXTRACTS FROM MR. SAMPSON'S SPEECH ON THE TRIAL OF MR. JAMES CHEETHAM, FOR
   A LIBEL ON MRS. MARGARET BONNEVILLE, IN HIS LIFE OF THOMAS PAINE.

   "In every other grief than that which this historian has inflicted on her
   the innocent find comfort; for innocence is in all other wrongs, against
   all other strokes of man's injustice , or oppression, a sevenfold shield.
   Not so where woman's' 'honor is assailed; suspicion there is worse than
   death itself. It is that for which alone the innocent wife of Cesar was
   repudiated. The man who dares attack it is of all other criminals the
   greatest. If he be not a traitor it is for this alone that he is worse.
   For many a man has suffered as a traitor, whom after-ages have revered and
   honored. But never was he who set his cloven-hoof upon a woman's honor
   worthy the name of man.

   [Here the defendant rose and claimed the protection of the court, not so
   much with a desire to prevent the range of the ingenious counsel, as to
   prevent the utterance of personalities, that it would not be prudent
   perhaps to repeat out of court.

   While the defendant was addressing the court, the counsel calmly advanced,
   and taking a pinch of snuff, modestly observed, that what he was doing was
   in court, and what was to be done out of court was not to be talked of
   here. Then pointing to the defendant, and casting a significant look upon
   him, he proceeded.]

   This unrighteous man has, by this very movement of his choler, justified
   all that I can ever say. If he complains of personalities - he who is
   hardened in every gross abuse - he who lives reviling and reviled; who
   might construct himself a monument, with no other materials but those
   records to which he is a party, and in which he stands enrolled as an
   offender - if he cannot sit still to hear his accusation, but calls for
   the protection of the court against a counsel, whose duty it is to make
   his crimes appear - how does she deserve protection whom he has driven to
   the sad necessity of .coming here to vindicate her honor from those
   personalities which he has lavished on her  Did not his opening counsel
   say before you that `he could make the color fade upon this lady's cheek,
   and wish that she might be in court to hear him 1 regret that her own son
   was not here to testify against her? Was not this monstrous personality?
   And when it is considered that before this very cause drew near its close,
   the other counsel of this same defendant rose and told you, that they
   admitted her character was spotless, and for that reason that no reproach
   was cast upon it, desire you to acquit their innocent client, who is a
   mere historian, who never could have malice, who was more ready to rectify
   his errors, than others to observe him.'

   But it is well, and I am glad that I was interrupted; for the very evil
   genius that waits upon his life has here, for once, worked to an honest
   end. For while my voice was almost choked with crowding truths, struggling
   for utterance, and while the swell of honest indignation rose even to
   suffocation, he came forward^ and pointed my attention to that subject
   which first deserved rebuke.

   I had said, that in the catalogue of crimes none could be found more base
   than his. Not treason, for the reasons I have given. Not murder; for he
   who murders life, murders all sorrow with it; but he has doomed this lady
   to days of sorrow, and to lingering death. The pirate meets his foe, or
   seeks his prey, where death and danger stare him in the face; and when he
   falls before the sword of justice, some sympathy may mingle with his
   shame, and men regret that one so brave in manly enterprise should fall so
   ignominiously. But here is an attack upon a woman far from her husband's
   side, from friends and home, whose infant sons are yet too tender to
   avenge their mother's wrongs. The forger who counterfeits some instrument
   to cheat you of your money, for that crime spins out his wretched days in
   hard captivity, in infamy and labor: will you compare his crime with that
   of one who, by his fabricated histories, pilfers from helpless women the
   only precious jewel which she prizes-her more than life, her all -her
   spotless honor? That which the robber or the thief purloins may be
   retrieved, or may be spared; but not the worth of twenty thousand beings
   such as the libeller, were he worth twenty thousand times as much as ever
   he will be, reform how he may, would pay the twenty thousandth part of
   that which he' has taken.

   It is argued that everything should be intended in favor of this
   defendant, who has written so godly a work against the prince of deists,
   and for the holy gospel. I am sorry to hear such arguments advanced; they
   go almost to burlesque religion itself. He a man of God! He write for the
   love of God! His book a godly book! a vile, obscene, and filthy
   compilation, which bears throughout the character of rancorous malice, and
   tramples upon every Christian charity. Libel an innocent woman, lie and
   calumniate, for the sake of Christianity! If this be the only godly deed
   this man has done, I pray to Heaven to be more merciful to him than he has
   been to Mrs. Bonneville, and that for this very work of godliness he be
   not damned.

   If you be Christian jurors punish him; for be assured of this, that twenty
   Paines, were twenty such just now upon this earth, could not conjointly do
   more harm to Christianity by their most violent efforts, than this man by
   defending it would do. If any one of wavering faith should hear that the
   best vindication of God's word was this most libellous and scandalous
   work, he never would be a Christian from that hour. Not every one that
   saith, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but least of all he
   that makes the blessed name of God a cloak for malice and iniquity. He may
   be like those priests of whom we read in history, who, with the holy cross
   in the one hand and the bloody sabre in the other, commit atrocities it
   which nature shudders.

   Where did he learn, that the God of mercy took delight in human
   sacrifices, and that, to do him honor, a woman's heart should palpitate
   upon a bloody altar? Has he ever read the word of God? or, this heavenly
   historian, does he know one letter of the gospel history? If he does, he
   is as blunt and dull in understanding, as he is dead to sensibility and
   delicacy. When a woman was brought before the author of the Christian
   religion, taken in the very fact of adultery, what did he say? He left
   behind him a specimen of tenderness ever memorable and divine. 'Let him,'
   he said to the fanatical and malignant rabble, 'let him who is innocent
   cast the first stone.'

   And if this Christian historian had ever known or felt the benignant
   spirit of holy inspiration, would he not be sensible that he was not
   innocent? If he be innocent, then are tigers gentle.

   There was a monastery where deadly crimes were expiated called La Trappe:
   when sinners entered it they made a terrible vow of everlasting silence,
   and from that awful moment never uttered a word, and daily with their
   nails dug their own graves. When the midnight bell tolled them to prayer,
   they left their solitary cells, and moved with noiseless step through
   gloomy cloisters and whispering aisles, with downcast look, turning their
   rosaries, but never spoke. Such is the penitence, such the everlasting
   silence that would become the ruthless slanderer of woman's honor. But he
   who acts the bully and the bravo, and calls himself the champion of high
   Heaven, what words can paint the horror he inspires! Then let us leave
   him.

   My duty calls me now to recapitulate the testimony of all his witnesses.
   The first and principal is Mr. Carver. He, with uplifted hand, affirmed,
   by the ever-living God, the truth of what he testified - and what was
   that? His letter tells us all: that he and Paine had a dispute for money;
   and in their correspondence you may find the crimes and baseness they
   reciprocally urged against each other. Mr. Carver, whose vulgar scurrilous
   letter makes the chief buttress of this man's defence, the more to spite
   his adversaries, flings out some calumny against the lady. Carver himself
   admits, that when she got a sight of it she threatened to prosecute him
   for that very letter. Yet on no better ground has this audacious libeller
   defamed her reputation.

   From the same source springs the infernal hint that little Thomas
   Bonneville had the countenance and features, of Thomas Paine. In his
   little nose no doubt the historian could discern, by learned inspection,
   the germes of future blossoms, and gems that in due course of nature
   should come to this world's light.

   Carver gives evidence of what he heard from Paine of Mrs. Bonneville,
   which he himself retailed to Cheetham; and Cheetham, rather than such
   sublime history should not shine forth to save poor sinners' souls,
   becomes his historian for the love of God, and gives them to the world as
   history. This is the history of this historian and his history!

   I pushed him (Carver) farther, and he stated that he and his wife had
   often gone to Mr. Purdy's on the farm to visit Mrs. Bonneville. Then it
   was, that seeing the toils in which his honesty and decency had fallen, he
   tapered off by saying he never had seen the slightest indication of any
   meretricious or illicit commerce between Paine and Mrs. Bonneville; that
   they never were alone together, and that all the three children, the
   little godson Thomas and all, were alike the objects of Paine's care.

   Here ends the black conspiracy and conjuration for the love of God. And
   now the sickened soul revives, and a bright scene appears: A group of
   matrons led by those hands which holy wedlock had joined to theirs for
   ever - heads of families beloved, distinguished, full of respect and
   honor; in form so bright, in innocence so lovely; so pure in unsuspected
   truth, so proud in conscious worth and dignity; who never till that hour
   had crossed the threshold of a court of justice, or been where discord
   reigns; whose lips had never uttered other oaths than those which bound
   them by the willing ties of constancy and love; who, when the seraph-voice
   of piety called them down, first glided from their spheres upon the wings
   of heaven-born charity, and having done their mission, disappeared. But,
   oh! it was a holy sacrament when wife and husband twined their oaths
   together with such solemnity, such beaming truth, as when they made before
   the altar of their God that vow so full at once of joy and awe that linked
   their future destiny together and made them ever one. They would have told
   you of this lady's sorrows and her resignation of her spotless conduct, of
   her merit; how they intrusted to her care and tutelage the jewels of their
   souls, the children of their hearts; with what reproachless truth; what
   anxious duty she answered to the trust; had not the rules of evidence and
   technical formalities of law cut short their story. Her general character
   was all they were allowed to testify. Their words were few, but like so
   many messages of grace or high commands, from heaven.

   The wives of your own bosoms are not more pure than this injured lady is
   proved, nay, more, admitted, now to be. If they were stigmatized by an
   historian, what would you say of him, that he was innocent or guilty?

   You have heard the witnesses for Mrs. Bonneville, and you may judge if
   this historian had inquired of them, instead of grubbing filth from every
   dunghill, how bright a name she would have deserved, who has been,
   nevertheless, doomed by this terrible man to misery.

   If he had begged access to any of those high distinguished persons under
   whose roof she lived, whose children she had taught; of Mr. Emmett, who
   oppresses no one, but protects the innocent; or of Mr. Fulton, who knew
   her and her husband in their own country; if he had asked of Mr. Jarvis -
   that man of keen sagacity, of observation, with knowledge of mankind and
   of all the parties; if he had been satisfied with Mr. Hitt's word, rather
   than that of `pious nurses and kind attending doctors,' and reverend
   teachers, who had disputes and lawsuits; he would have known what all but
   his mutinous genius now concedes. I have no cause of private malice
   against him, but quite the contrary. When he had any spark of character,
   he praised me more than ever I could merit, and I could not but thank him.
   When he had nothing good to give but his abuse, without offense or change
   in me, be gave me that with equal liberality, and I thanked him. If I
   could ask a favor of him now, it would be to abuse me more and more, and
   never let his malice go to the length of praising me: for although my
   friends who know me well might not despise me, yet in this community where
   I am little known, and still almost a stranger, I may not have formed
   sufficient character to stand against his praise, nor be entitled to so
   much indulgence that it should be believed that I could have his praise,
   and yet be honest."

   This same Cheetham, the libeller of Madame Bonneville, and through her of
   Paine's memory, is the author of other calumnies on Paine. It is by him
   that the public have been informed that Paine was drunken and dirty in his
   person; and so industriously and faithfully have the clergy preached and
   circulated these calumnies, that we shall scarcely be believed in
   contradicting them on the very best evidences, his companions now alive,
   and in some cases the very men whom Cheetham impudently names as sources
   of his information. Thus. Mr. Jarvis, the celebrated painter, with whom
   Mr. Paine lived, informs us distinctly that Mr. Paine was neither dirty in
   his habits nor drunken: nay, he good-humoredly added that he always drank
   a great deal more than ever Paine did. Mr. John Fellows lived in the same
   house with Mr. Paine above a twelvemonth, and was his intimate friend for
   many years after his return to this country, and never saw him but once
   even elevated with liquor, and then he had been to a dinner-party. We know
   more than twenty persons who were more or less acquainted with Mr. Paine,
   and not one of whom ever saw him in liquor. His habit appears to have been
   to take one glass of rum and water with sugar in it, after dinner, and
   another after supper. His limit at one period, when at Rochelle, was one
   quart of rum a week, for himself and friends, for Mr. Paine was rather
   penurious in his old age. This, and this alone, is the only moral fault we
   find in his character, and we wish to be his impartial historian. His
   manner of life at this time we get from Mr. Burger, a respectable
   watchmaker in New York, but then a clerk in the only store at Rochelle,
   who served Mr. Paine with his liquor, and waited upon him when sick, and
   drove him about the neighborhood at the request of his employer, and thus
   saw much of his social habits. This gentleman never saw Mr. Paine
   intoxicated. Carver, with whom Paine lived, but from whom he parted in
   anger, is the only man we know who has not spoken distinctly on that
   Subject; and he remarks, that "Paine was like other men [at that period],
   he would sometimes take too much." But Carver had unfortunately committed
   himself on this subject in an angry letter, the same on which Cheetham
   based his libel. In fact, this letter is the groundwork for all Cheetham's
   calumnies. Mr. Grant Thorburn, a few years back, republished this letter
   in his "Forty Years' Residence," on which occasion Carver vindicates
   himself in one of his last publications, where he thus speaks of that
   letter:-

   EXTRACT FROM "A BONE TO GNAW FOR GRANT THORBURN," BY W. CARVER.

   "When I first read the life of Grant Thorburn, I made this remark, and
   wrote it on the cover of his book: 'I have read this life of Grant
   Thorburn. I presume a great part of which it is composed has no more
   connexion with his life than mine, or the pope of Rome's, to wit: the
   corresponding letters between Thomas Paine and myself, and those letters I
   have cut out of his book. These letters were first printed by Cheetham
   without my consent for base purposes," after he became a tory and a
   hypocritical turncoat, like Grant Thorburn, who has now reprinted them for
   the same purpose. They were written by Paine and me in anger. Mr. Paine
   had boarded with me without any regular agreement, and we quarrelled about
   the bill, what has happened a thousand times to other people; he wrote
   angrily and I angrily replied. But the affair was amicably settled by
   Walter Morton and John Fellows; the latter is still living. I think some
   things Paine said of me were not in earnest, and I answered in anger: the
   letters should have been burnt. But Cheetham said many things of Paine
   that were not true after he turned tory. I told him 'I believed that he
   had had his hand crossed with British gold.' Mr. Charles Christian was
   present; he said to Cheetham: `That is a bold attack of Carver in your own
   house.' He replied and said: 'I know Carver; he will contradict a judge on
   the bench if he thinks him not right;' but he did not deny the charge.
   When Paine was on his deathbed, I wrote him the following letter. This
   shows what opinion I had of him; I think he was one of the greatest men
   that ever lived.

   'Dear Sir: I have heard that you are much indisposed in health, and that
   your mind, at present, is not reconciled to me. Be that as it may, I can
   assure you that, on my part, I bear no ill-will, but still remain your
   sincere well-wisher; and am still a zealous supporter and defender of the
   principles that you have advocated, believing they are founded on immortal
   truth and justice; therefore I think it a pity that you or myself should
   depart this life with envy in our hearts against each other - and I firmly
   believe that no difference would have taken place between us, had not some
   of those of your pretended friends endeavored to have caused a separation
   of friendship between us.

   I, sir, want nothing of you or from you, but only that the ignorant and
   superstitious herd may not have it in their power to exclaim and say that
   Thomas Paine or Carver died without a reconciliation to each other. I have
   often told my friends, if I were on my dying bed, I should send for you,
   hoping that all our differences might be buried in oblivion before our
   bodies were buried in the grave, as I hope, that my dying pillow may not
   be planted with thorns; I consider that time with me is short, and perhaps
   shorter with you. If I never should see you again in this world, I wish
   you all the consolation that your great mind is capable of enjoying, and
   that you may resign yourself with full confidence on your Maker, and leave
   a noble testimony to the world of the independency of your mind and
   honesty of your heart; and this, my friend, will produce to you more
   comfort than all the prayers of the priests in the Christian world.

   Yours in friendship,

                                                                WM. CARVER.'"

   Mr. Grant Thorburn, mentioned above, scarcely knew Mr. Paine, as Mr.
   Carver observes, nor does his conduct command respect.

   Such are the men, who, admitting the truth of Mr. Paine's writings, seek
   to destroy their effects by the most puerile attack on his private
   character. Cheetham, Thorburn, and others, have repeated slanders
   suggested in an angry letter; the enemies of Paine, corrupt statesmen, and
   the clergy in particular, have so industriously circulated these slanders,
   as even to deceive the very friends of Mr. Paine. In commencing our
   inquiries we really thought the fact that Mr. Paine was a drunkard in old
   age was well established. In seeking, however, for the proofs of this, we
   arrive at a very different conclusion. In the course of this work we shall
   show the sources from which we have derived our information.

                                                                        G. V.

                             LIFE OF THOMAS PAINE.

                                    PART I.

   Most men pursue personal happiness and their own greatness as worthy
   objects; but Mr. Paine labored for the greatness of the nation of which he
   was a member, and sought its happiness; and in the pursuit of which he
   built up his own greatness and promoted his own happiness. Nothing will be
   clearer established by this record of his life than the fact now alluded
   to; and this fact marks him as peculiarly distinguished even among great
   and good men. We are not, however, about to write a eulogy; to enhance his
   virtues, or to suppress his faults, or vices. Paine was a part of human
   nature, and partook of its imperfections; and our purpose is fairly to
   represent him as he was; but the greater part of Mr. Paine's life was
   public, and as such we know of no man who had greater virtues or less
   vices. His natural life is distinctly marked into four periods: his
   history in England before he embarked for North America; his residence and
   exertions in this country during the revolutionary war; his return to
   Europe, and his exertions in France and England during the great French
   revolution and revolutionary war; and his final return and residence in
   the United States till his death. The first part will necessarily be the
   least interesting; his merits were only known to a few; but fortunately
   among those few was Dr. Franklin (by whose advice he visited this
   country). We have already noticed Sherwin's life of Paine, and as we find
   Paine's early life fairly delineated there, with some exceptions, we shall
   at once transcribe so much of that work as suits our purpose; correcting
   it where we find it necessary, and making such additions as we think
   proper from the abundant facts we have accumulated.

                        THE EARLY LIFE OF THOMAS PAINE.

   "Thomas Paine, the subject of these memoirs, was born at Thetford, in the
   county of Norfolk, England, on the 29th of January, 1737. His parents were
   obscure as to birth, having nothing to depend upon, except what was
   derived from their own industry. His father, Joseph Paine, was a member of
   the society of quakers, a person of sober habits and good moral character:
   he obtained a decent, but humble livelihood by following his trade, which
   was that of a staymaker. The maiden name of his mother was Frances Cocke,
   the daughter of an attorney at Thetford, and a member of the established
   church. It was probably owing to the disagreement in the religious tenet
   of his parents that Paine was never baptized. He was, however, privately
   named, and through the pious care of his aunt, he was afterward confirmed
   by the bishop of Norwich.

   At an early age, Paine was sent to the grammar-school at Thetford, where
   he was taught reading, writing, and accounts. Before he left this school,
   he likewise obtained a slight knowledge of the Latin tongue; but from the
   aversion or contempt which he subsequently acquired for the study of the
   dead languages, or from want of opportunity, it does not appear that they
   ever became the objects of settled attention.

   It does not seem, or at least it is not known, that, during his boyhood,
   he exhibited any peculiar signs of that genius which was afterward to
   exalt him to the very pinnacle of political fame. But from a passage in
   the 'Age of Reason,' it is evident, that however matured in judgment he
   might be before he became a politician, his first impressions on the
   subject of religion were made at a very early period of his life. Paine
   himself says: 'From the time I was capable of conceiving an idea, and
   acting upon it by reflection, I either doubted the truth of the Christian
   system, or thought it to be a strange affair; I scarcely knew which it
   was: but I well remember, when about seven or eight years of age, hearing
   a sermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee of the
   church, upon the subject of what is called redemption by the Son of God.
   After the sermon was ended, I went into the garden, and as I was going
   down the garden steps (for I perfectly recollect the spot) I revolted at
   the recollection of what I had heard, and thought to myself that it was
   making God Almighty act like a passionate man that killed his son, when he
   could not revenge himself any other way; and as I was sure a man would be
   hanged that did such a thing, I could not see for what purpose they
   preached such sermons. This was not one of those kind of thoughts that had
   anything in it of childish levity; it was to me a serious reflection,
   arising from the idea I had, that God was too good to do such an action,
   and also too almighty to be under any necessity of doing it. I believe in
   the same manner to this moment; and I moreover believe, that any system of
   religion that has any thing in it that shocks the mind of a child, cannot
   be a true system.'-Age of Reason? Part I., p. 37.

   At the age of thirteen he was taken from school by his father, who, unable
   from his circumstances to apprentice him to any other trade, employed him
   as an assistant in the business of staymaking. Whether he was ever bound
   apprentice does not appear, nor is it a matter of much consequence. The
   sedentary shopboard had few attractions for our author, and he left it the
   first opportunity. After remaining with his father about three years, he
   left his native town and proceeded to London, where he doubtless hoped to
   better his circumstances; conceiving, as many had done before him, that
   the metropolis was the only place where a youth can attain a proper
   knowledge of the world, and the only scene where natural talent can find
   an opportunity of displaying itself to the best advantage. His mind, which
   nature appears to have formed for enterprise, was of too aspiring a turn
   to be restricted to the limits of a provincial town, or to brook the idea
   of being confined for life to a business which would not only have cramped
   his genius, but which at best would have afforded him but a scanty
   livelihood. His prospects in London, however, do not seem to have been at
   first much more inviting than those he had left in the country. On hi3
   arrival, he found himself without either friends or money, and destitute
   of the means of procuring any, except by again having recourse to the
   business he had just deserted. He applied to a Mr. Morris, a staymaker, in
   Hanover Street, Long Acre, of whom he procured employment for some weeks.
   From London he went to Dover, where he worked at his business for a short
   time, with a Mr. Grace.

   How long a time elapsed from the period of his leaving his father to his
   quitting Mr. Grace does not appear, nor, if known, would it be a matter of
   much interest. Probably, not more than two or three months. Finding
   himself baffled in the expectations he had formed on quitting his home, he
   left his second employer, and went on board the Terrible privateer,
   Captain Death. To a mind like his, which appears at the time we are
   speaking of, to have been ardent in the extreme, it is not surprising that
   the war which had just then been declared against France, afforded an
   abundant field of enterprising anticipation. Situated as he was, and
   feeling as he probably did, the army or the navy was his only choice, and
   he took the latter because it was nearest at hand. How long he remained on
   board the Terrible, has not been ascertained; but from his own account of
   the affair, the time must have been short. 'From this adventure,' says he,
   'I was happily prevented by the affectionate and moral remonstrance of a
   good father, who, from his own habits of life, being of the quaker
   profession, must begin to look upon me as lost.'

   Paine had been induced to go to sea from the impressions which the master
   of the school at Thetford had given him; who having been a chaplain on
   board a man-of-war, retained much of the enthusiasm of the sea service,
   and indirectly infused it into the most ardent of his scholars. This
   affair made a considerable impression at the time; but, like most of the
   impressions of youth, it soon wore away, and left his disposition for
   enterprise in much the same state as it was before the circumstance
   occurred. Shortly afterward, he entered on board the King of Prussia
   privateer, Captain Mendez; but as no account has been published of this
   transaction, except that given by himself, it does not appear how long he
   remained at sea, or what occurred to induce him to desert the naval
   profession altogether, and resume his own business.

   In the year 1759, he settled at Sandwich as a master-staymaker. There he
   soon became acquainted with a young woman of the name of Mary Lambert, to
   whom he was married about the end of the same year. She was the daughter
   of an exciseman, and is said to have possessed considerable personal
   attractions.

   His staymaking business not exactly answering his expectations, he removed
   with his wife to Margate, where she died in the year 1760. From Margate he
   went to London, and from London he again removed to Thetford.

   Here he resolved upon relinquishing his business altogether. He had long
   wished for some employment more congenial to his turn of mind. At length,
   through the interference of Mr. Cocksedge, the recorder at Thetford, he
   obtained a situation in the excise. This was toward the end of 1763.

   For some trifling fault he was dismissed from this situation, in something
   more than a year afterward. What the nature of that fault was, has never
   been satisfactorily explained; but those who are acquainted with the
   practices of the excise, must be well convinced that if the offence had
   been of any magnitude, he would never have been restored to the office,
   which was the case in about eleven months after his dismissal.

   Mr. Paine, it appears, sent a petition to the board of excise begging to
   be restored to his situation. In the petition, Paine admits the justice of
   his dismissal, but uses the expression, "No complaint of the least
   dishonesty or intemperance ever appeared against me." For what he was
   dismissed is not stated, and what is very remarkable, his enemies in the
   British government who must have known the cause of his dismissal, never
   made it public, although they sought to destroy him by every means. We
   consequently conclude that he was not criminal, or such an opportunity
   would not have been omitted. * Those who have lived on the coast of
   England know that the impartial exercise of an exciseman's duty, will
   expose him to censure; for they will know that those who make and
   administer the laws are themselves concerned in smuggling. Clio Rickman,
   the friend of Paine, exposed a flagitious case of this kind, involving
   even the prime minister of England, which, from its peculiarity, we shall
   insert:-

   "When Admiral Duncan rendezvoused in the Downs with his fleet on the
   eighth of January, 1806, the Spider (lugger), Daniel Falara, master, was
   sent to Guernsey to smuggle articles for the fleet, such as wine, spirits,
   hair-powder, playing cards, tobacco, &c., for the supply of the different
   ships.

   At her arrival in the Downs, the ships' boats flocked round her to unload
   her and her contraband cargo. A customhouse extra boat, commanded by
   William Wallace, seeing the lugger, followed and took her; in doing which
   he did his duty.

   On his inspecting the smuggled articles with which she was laden, he found
   a number of cases directed to Admiral Duncan, the Eight Honorable William
   Pitt, the heaven-born minister of England, and to the Right Honorable
   Henry Dundas, Walmer Castle, in a few days, Wallace, the master of the
   customhouse cutter, received orders from government to give the lugger and
   her smuggled cargo up, on penalty of being dismissed; the service, and
   these cases of smuggled goods were afterward delivered at the prime
   minister's, Mr. Pitt's, at Walmer Castle."

   At this very time, says Clio Rickman, there were fourteen poor persons in
   one jail in England for smuggling. From the surprising silence of Paine's
   enemies on the subject of his dismissal, we strongly suspect it was
   connected with something they did not want exposed.

   "After his dismission he proceeded to London, where he became a teacher in
   an academy kept by Mr. Noble of Goodman's Fields. In this situation he
   remained until the period of his restoration to office. It is probable
   that it was during his stay in London at this period, he applied himself
   to the study of astronomy and natural philosophy, and that this is the
   time he alludes to, when he says, 'As soon as I was able I purchased a
   pair of globes, and attended the philosophical lectures of Martin and
   Ferguson, and became afterward acquainted with Dr. Bevis of the Society
   called the Royal Society, and an excellent astronomer.' Indeed, as he
   himself expresses it, the natural bent of his mind appears to have been to
   science, and though from his disadvantageous situation in life he
   necessarily met with many obstacles, it is evident from several of his
   productions, that he attained a great proficiency in mechanics,
   mathematics, and astronomy. It was from his being well grounded in the
   principles of science, during the earlier part of his life, that he
   afterward became such a powerful adept in reasoning; it was from the
   mathematical principles which had been engrafted on his mind while it was
   yet tender enough to receive the impressions of instruction, that he was
   subsequently enabled to write with such precision upon almost any subject,
   that he was enabled to reduce abstruseness to simplicity, to understand
   difficult subjects himself, and to render them intelligible to others."

   The enemies of Mr. Paine have represented him as an ignorant, vulgar man,
   and his style coarse and rude, but imbued with strong good sense. His
   worst enemies allow him the latter qualities, except Cheetham; who, heated
   by party politics, and corrupted by expectancies from Britain, has
   outraged common sense by denying Paine any good qualities, while his own
   work abounds with proofs to the contrary. Paine's style was clear,
   forcible, and elegant: in our opinion, he is the best English writer we
   know. We never misunderstand him; and it is almost impossible to put the
   same thoughts in fewer or better chosen words than he has done. Those who
   have attacked his style, are themselves ignorant or vicious, with no
   literary character to lose. When the clergy have urged on their hearers
   the vulgarity of the style of Mr. Paine, it has always appeared to us that
   they have presumed on the ignorance of their hearers, or have themselves
   been the dupes of what they wished to believe: for Paine was decidedly a
   learned man, but self-taught, as indeed most learned men are; for the
   meager instruction of a school only gives the rudiments- the base-that on
   which the fabric must be raised. Paine's knowledge of the classics was
   indeed very limited; perhaps the mere, elements obtained when a boy at the
   grammar school; but even this gave him one important advantage: the little
   he did know enabled him rightly to estimate the value of Greek and Latin,
   which are of great intrinsic worth only in some cases, and of none to Mr.
   Paine in any of his pursuits or works; and when he stated that a Greek
   milkman knew more of Greek than the best Greek scholar in England, he
   lifted the veil which covered ignorance'; although a scholar might know
   much of the grammar or philosophical construction of the language, which a
   Greek milkman might not. In his biblical criticisms, he showed that the
   authorized English Bible was not the Word of God; and thus he cut off all
   reference to ancient languages. His acquaintance with mathematics and
   natural philosophy was evidently extensive. His references to these
   subjects are frequent, and always pertinent; while there is no egotistical
   display of knowledge or learning; yet every learned man knows well the
   certainty of detecting ignorance in a man who, by references, assumes a
   knowledge of science which he does not possess. Paine grappled, too, with
   the higher branches of the mathematics, for he was acquainted with their
   application to mechanics and to bridges; and this latter is one of the
   most difficult subjects to which they are applied. It was not then a
   compliment that Paine was admitted a member of various learned societies
   in this country, France, and England. He had substantial claims to such a
   standing; and those who have attempted to degrade him on this subject,
   have taken a mean advantage of his unpopularity in the religious
   community, and of the ignorance and prejudices of that community against
   him. We have now in our possession a part of a letter in Paine's
   handwriting, on the difficult subject of fortification, in relation to New
   York, and which he treats in a scientific and masterly manner. The
   subject, too, has his own peculiarity, that of utility and being
   well-timed; for then it was a desideratum to fortify New York.

   We return now to the narrative of events, and shall again make use' of
   Sherwin's life, as containing an elegant narrative of the facts we wish to
   communicate. On Paine's petition to the board of excise, was written:
   "July 4th, 1766; to be restored on a proper vacancy." He was therefore
   restored; and leaving his scholastic pursuits, he returned again to the
   excise for several years.

   "On his reappointment to the excise, our author immediately returned from
   London to Thetford, where he continued until the spring of 1768, when he
   was removed to Lewes, in Sussex. There he resided in the house of a person
   of the name of Ollive, a tobacconist. With him he remained upward of
   twelve months, when the former died, leaving a widow, a daughter, and
   several sons. Our author then left the family for a short time, but soon
   afterward returned, when he opened the# shop on his own account. In
   consequence of this, and of his having previously lived under the same
   roof, he soon contracted an intimacy with Miss Ollive, the daughter of his
   former landlord, whom he married in the year 1771."

   At this time Paine appears to have mingled a little politics with his
   pursuits; and he is reported to have written an electioneering ballad, and
   to have been paid for it: but we know of none but a jeu d'esprit, "The
   Trial and Execution of the Farmer's Dog" in ridicule of both parties, and
   therefore not likely to be paid for by any one; besides, Paine when better
   known, never made a profit of his political works, or even reserved a
   copyright. We therefore doubt that he was paid for such a service;
   although pay for honorable services, is by no means unreasonable.

   In 1772 he wrote "The Case of the Excise Officers," a small pamphlet, on a
   very limited and unpopular subject: yet in this pamphlet Mr. Paine's style
   and principles are recognised.

   "The same conciseness, clearness, and benevolence, which form such
   prominent features in the future productions of Paine, are distinguishable
   in almost every page of the pamphlet in question. Exclusive of the
   'Introduction,' it is divided into two parts: 'The State of the Salary of
   the Officers of Excise;' and 'Thoughts on the Corruption of Principles,
   and on the Numerous Evils arising to the Revenue from the too great
   Poverty of the Officers of Excise.' In the introduction is stated the
   design of the excise officers, in all parts of the kingdom, to make an
   application to parliament to have the state of their salaries taken into
   consideration. The subject is then entered upon and discussed with all the
   energy and ability which might have been expected from a long-experienced
   advocate. The deductions that are made upon the exciseman's salary by
   unavoidable contingencies, and the danger to which his duty necessarily
   exposes him, are recapitulated in the most forcible manner. Under the
   second head, the policy of our author's object is insisted upon: he
   advises the government to render their officers honest by relieving their
   necessities; and the pamphlet concludes by enumerating the advantages that
   would be ensured by adopting the recommendation.

   Of this pamphlet four thousand copies were printed by Mr. William Lee, of
   Lewes; but to what extent they were circulated I have not been able to
   learn. It would doubtless be read with pleasure and avidity by the class
   of men who were interested in the result; but whatever might be the
   distresses of the excisemen, it was not likely that they would meet with
   much sympathy or encouragement from the public. The nature of their
   occupation, and the unpleasant mode in which the duties of it are
   performed, have always rendered them objects of public odium; and however
   misdirected or useless such odium may be, it will ever continue an
   appendage to the character of those who collect this tyrannical impost.
   The public, therefore, viewed the complaints of the excisemen with
   indifference; and though considerable exertions were made by various
   individuals, as well as our author, there was no member to be found to
   bring the subject before parliament. The distresses of the officers, and
   the consequent depredations on the revenue, which our author had so ably
   pointed out, and so zealously endeavored to get removed, were not deemed
   of sufficient importance to merit parliamentary inquiry, and the proposal,
   like many other proposals for the removal of public evils, fell to the
   ground without investigation."

   During Mr. Paine's residence at Lewes, he was held as a man of talents in
   the small circle of that town. His company was sought by men of greater
   affluence than himself. He was decidedly a good companion, whether engaged
   in amusements or debate. Paine at that time was fond of bowls, then a
   fashionable game: even Dr. Young, the elegant author of the Night
   Thoughts, was a member of a club, and attended a bowling-green. Paine in
   this amusement mingled with the best company in the place. He met, too, an
   evening club at Lewes in the principal tavern, for conversation and
   debate; and in that society, the best the town afforded, he carried the
   palm as a debater. While, however, he was thus social, he neither drank to
   excess, nor did he indulge in the vulgar habit of swearing, a habit he
   never contracted; and which, even in his latter days, he reproved in some
   of his intimate friends. This fact is confirmed to us by Mr. Jarvis, the
   celebrated painter, with whom Mr. Paine lived sometime before his death.
   This is worthy of note; for his enemies, foiled by his arguments, and not
   being able to attach to him crimes, have assumed faults and magnified them
   into vices. We have these facts from those who knew Paine at Lewes, and
   from those who knew the company he kept, and his habits. Carver, with whom
   Paine afterward lived in New York, was then an apprentice in the town, and
   used to saddle Mr. Paine's horse, and well remembers both him and his
   reputation. We know, too, the family of Rickman, who always resided in
   that neighborhood; and on their information and others we can rely.

   "I have already observed, that on the marriage of our author with Miss
   Ollive, he commenced the business of a tobacconist and grocer, which he
   carried on in much the same method as his predecessor had done before him.
   This circumstance, as might have been anticipated, soon rendered him an
   object of suspicion in the eyes of the commissioners, and it is not
   improbable that the zeal which Paine had displayed in exposing the
   pernicious consequences of doling out so pitiful a provision to the active
   class of excisemen, while their betters were spending their days in ease
   and affluence, had rendered him an object of dislike among his superiors
   in office. The spirit of independence which he showed on all occasions,
   and which there is very little, doubt he communicated in a considerable
   degree to those around him, was but little calculated to ensure the
   approbation of persons who regard implicit obedience as the test of merit,
   who look upon a proposal for reform as a step toward revolution, and the
   protection of abuses as the only mode of perpetuating the blessings of the
   English system of government. Considerable pains were taken to discover
   some flaw in the conduct of Paine; but so strictly had he performed his
   duty, that nothing of arty consequence could be substantiated against him.
   His keeping a tobacconist's shop was, however, a sufficient pretext with
   those who wished to rid themselves of so troublesome a servant, and he was
   a second time dismissed from the excise in April, 1774."

   At this period Paine became unfortunate in his business; perhaps he
   suffered from his social qualities, and a spirit of independence. His
   companions, we have already remarked, were generally in better
   circumstances than himself; and these sought his company for its intrinsic
   worth, for he was both instructive and amusing; and perhaps he incurred
   expenses and a loss of time, which he was unable to afford; while a
   sanguine temper would still afford him hope, till his affairs were too bad
   to mend. His goods, at this period, were sold to pay his debts; and in the
   following month, May, 1774, he separated from his wife by mutual consent,
   and articles were signed on the 4th of June, by which she retained the
   little property she had brought him at marriage, and which was just
   sufficient to maintain her in a decent manner for the rest of her life.
   All the causes of this separation are not known. Mr. Paine uniformly spoke
   of his wife with kindness; and Clio Rickman informs us, in his life of
   Paine, that he frequently sent her money, without letting her know the
   source whence it came. She was afterward a professor of a sectarian
   religion in Cranbrook, Kent, and boarded in the house of a watchmaker, a
   member of the same church; his house was consequently visited by religious
   people, many of them with strong prejudices, and some very ignorant.
   These, after the publication of the "Age of Reason," would sometimes speak
   disrespectfully of Mr. Paine in her presence, when she uniformly left the
   room without a word. If, too, she was questioned on the subject of their
   separation, she did the same. We have these facts from those who resided
   with her. Our most intimate friend at one period, was a Mr. Bourne, a
   watchmaker in Rye; about eighteen miles from Cranbrook, England. This
   gentleman was apprenticed in the house where Mrs. Paine lived: he sat at
   the same table with her for years. We have these facts confirmed by other
   residents at Cranbrook. Thus nothing could be learned from her, except
   that though she differed from Mr. Paine on religious subjects, she could
   not bear to hear him spoken ill of. Paine, as we have before remarked,
   spoke respectfully of her; but if any person became inquisitive, he
   immediately answered rudely, that "his separation was a private affair."
   Clio Rickman asserts, and the most intimate friends of Mr. Paine support
   him, that Paine never cohabited with his second wife. Sherwin treats the
   subject as ridiculous; but Clio Rickman was a man of integrity, and he
   asserts that he has the documents showing this strange point, together
   with others, proving that this arose from no physical defects in Paine.
   When the question was plainly put to Mr. Paine by a friend of ours, he
   admitted this singular fact; but replied, "I had a cause; it is no
   business of anybody."" Singular, therefore, as this fact is, as both
   parties preserved a taciturnity on the subject, we have not the means of
   arriving at the truth. It was, as Paine said, a private affair; and we
   have not the means of withdrawing the veil, and have consequently no right
   to come to an uncharitable conclusion toward either party. We however
   infer that Paine had a cause; without which his wife ought to and would
   have exposed him, especially as she was surrounded by his bitter enemies.

   Paine, while at Lewes, was a whig; and as such never thought of examining
   the first principles of government. A king, lords, and commons, were
   admitted as forming the best government by the admixture of the three
   sorts, royal, aristocratic, and democratic. As a whig, all he sought was
   the preservation of the supposed constitution; but a trifling expression
   from one of his companions, gave his thoughts a deeper range, and formed
   the basis of his "Common Sense" and "Rights of Man," which afterward so
   materially influenced the people in North America, France, and England.
   While sitting over some punch after a game at bowls, a Mr. Verral observed
   of Frederick, king of Prussia, that "he was the best fellow in the world
   for a king; he had so much of the devil in him." Simple and accidental as
   this observation was, it turned Paine's thoughts on the rights by which
   kings existed and governed, and thus led him into an examination of the
   inherent rights of the people; while the breaking up of his business, and
   separation from his wife, led him forward to the proper scene in which his
   talents and his principles could be properly estimated. Sherwin, speaking
   of this period, remarks:

   "Our author was by this and prior events relieved from every tie which
   might be supposed to bind him to his country. Deprived of his home, and
   destitute of friends and employment, he had to commence life anew, and
   that without either credit or capital. His parents were become much
   advanced in years; their industry was no more than sufficient to procure a
   maintenance for themselves, and therefore Paine could not have derived,
   even if he had desired, any assistance from their kindness. The cheerless
   prospect which lay expanded before him, the misfortunes that had already
   befallen him, and the desolate situation in which he was then placed, must
   have impressed upon his mind the idea that to whatever country he went, it
   was impossible for his condition to become worse. In England there was no
   hope. Every change only brought an accumulation of fresh misfortunes.
   Borne down by poverty, and surrounded by difficulties of every
   description, his condition appears to have been that of a ruined, hopeless
   man.

   In this situation many would have sat down discouraged without a struggle.
   But despair and dismay appear to have formed no part of Paine's character.
   He seems never to have sunk into the extreme of depression, or to have
   risen to that tumultuous gladness which so often accompanies the extreme
   of elevation. His mind appears never to have been crushed by defeat, or
   elated by success.' The unshaken fortitude which can smile on
   disappointment and danger, and look serenely amidst the tumult of triumph,
   seems to have been the most prominent feature in his character.

   "After the sale of his effects and the separation from his wife were
   concluded, our author again went to London. By what means he procured a
   living during his stay in the metropolis is unknown, but soon after his
   arrival he obtained an introduction to Dr. Franklin, who advised him to go
   to America. The doctor probably perceived in his interviews with Paine
   that he was a man possessed of abilities of no ordinary character, and
   this accounts for the readiness with which he furnished him with a letter
   of introduction to one of his most intimate friends in the United States.
   Our author was thus afforded an opportunity of beginning life again, and
   that at an age when his ardent and enterprising spirit must have been'
   considerably tamed by the sharp lessons of adversity. He had as he himself
   observes, 'served an apprenticeship to life,' and it is more than probable
   that those sublime ideas on the subject of liberty which were afterward to
   raise his name so very high in the temple of fame, were produced by his
   early misfortunes.

   By wo the soul to daring action swells;
   By wo in plaintness patience it excels;
   From patience, prudent, clear experience springs,
   And traces knowledge through the cause of things!
   Thence hope is formed, thence fortitude, success,
   Renown-whate'er men covet and caress.'

                                                                      Savage.

   Poverty is certainly not the parent of genius, but it is unquestionably
   its best preceptor: The finest productions we have in the language have
   been written by men whose intellectual powers have forced their way into
   life under circumstances of the most abject penury. In most instances it
   has happened that the fire of genius has been long confined by the heavy
   black clouds of adversity, before it acquired sufficient strength to burst
   its boundary; and as the streaming lightning is more or less vivid in
   proportion to the density or lightness of the clouds which encompass it,
   so it has generally proved that the powers of a fine imagination have been
   more or less brilliant, in proportion to the poverty or plenty by which
   the possessor was surrounded. The enlivening wit of Congreve, the melting
   scenes of Otway, the rural tenderness and pathetic simplicity of
   Goldsmith, and the dignified ease and elegance of Thomson, would have been
   unknown to us, if these luminaries in the hemisphere of literature had
   been born in a state of affluence; for though the men might have lived
   with much more comfort to themselves than they did, it is very probable
   that the easy couch and plentiful board would have destroyed the
   inspiration which gave birth to their finest productions.

   But to our author. He had by this time seen enough of the world to despise
   its follies, and he had witnessed too many of the bad effects of
   misgovernment in his native country to feel any' affection for them, when
   directed against the country of which he was about to become a citizen.
   Dr. Franklin could not therefore have selected a man more likely to repay
   his kindness in vindicating the cause of the people, by whom he was
   deputed ambassador to England. Our author sailed from this country
   [England] toward the end of the year 1774, and arrived at Philadelphia
   about two months afterward."

   We have thus briefly brought Mr. Paine to the close of the first period of
   his life; a period of no important interest to the public; and only
   valuable as qualifying him for the other periods, which belonged wholly to
   the public. His good sense was the work of nature; his acquired knowledge,
   whether of books or men, was the effect of study and observation; but to
   these was added experience, the result of accident; but admirably adapted
   to fit him for his future tasks, of which he could have no conception. We
   have seen him necessarily a mechanic, a sailor, a tradesman, an exciseman,
   a storekeeper, and a teacher, acquainted with London, and different
   sections of Great Britain; intimate with the corruptions and revenue of
   the country from his connexion with the excise; an author, a politician,
   and associating with various classes in the community; with a habit for
   observation and original thinking, and thus qualified to address a whole
   people on the subject of liberty. His father a quaker, his mother of the
   established church, and his wife and her friends dissenters, he could have
   but little religious prejudice. While accident, however painful to
   himself, which sent him to this country, unencumbered with either wife,
   family, or fortune, contributed highly to render him devoted to the people
   among whom he was about to reside, during their arduous struggle in
   support of liberty.

                                    PART II.

    

   FROM MR. PAlNE'S ARRIVAL IN AMERICA TO THE END OF THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.

   Mr. Paine having resolved to leave England, brought letters of
   recommendation from Dr. Franklin, then on an embassy from a northern state
   to the British government in London. Mr. Paine left England in the autumn
   of 1774, and arrived at Philadelphia in the latter part of the same year;
   and not in 1772, as Dr. Rush states. Sherwin correctly says:

   "From this period to the day of his death, the abilities of Paine never
   lay dormant. Very shortly after his arrival in Philadelphia, he became_
   acquainted with Mr. Aitkin, a respectable bookseller of that town. In
   January, 1775, Mr. Aitkin commenced the publication of the Pennsylvania
   Magazine, of which Paine became the editor. Many of the pieces in this
   publication are truly elegant. In these, as in most of his other writings,
   he is singularly happy in clothing an original boldness of thought with a
   peculiar beauty of diction. The article in which he treats of the hidden
   riches of the earth, and the diligence with which we ought to search after
   them, is a fine specimen of this rare combination. The well-known song on
   the death of General Wolfe, appeared in an early number of this magazine;
   and it is unquestionably one of the most beautiful productions of the sort
   in the English language. The ideas would have done honor to any of the
   poets of old, and the poetry is an example of the most polished
   versification. As this little piece is still much admired, even by those
   who disapprove of its author's political and religious notions, I here
   insert it, as transcribed from an original copy:

   SONG ON THE DEATH OF GENERAL WOLFE.

   In a mouldering cayc, where the wretched retreat,

   Britannia sat wasted with care:
   She mourned for her Wolfe, and exclaimed 'against fate,

   And gave herself up to despair.
   The walls of her cell she had sculptured around

   With the feats of her favorite son,
   And even the dust, as it lay on the ground.

   Was engraved with some deeds he had done.

    

   The sire of the gods, from his crystalline throne,

   Beheld the disconsolate daine,
   And, moved with her tears, lie sent Mercury down,

   And these were the tidings that came:
   "Britannia, forbear, not a sigh or a tear,

   For thy Wolfe, so deservedly loved;
   Your tears shall be changed into triumphs of joy,

   For thy Wolfe is not dead, but removed.

    

   The sons of the east, the proud giants of bid,

   Have crept from their darksome abodes,
   And this is the news, as in heaven it was told,

   They were marching to war with the gods.
   A council was held in the chambers of Jove,

   And this was their final decree,
   That Wolfe should be called to the armies above,

   And the charge was intrusted to me.

    

   To the plains of Quebec with the orders I flew,

   He begged for a moment's delay; f

   He cried*' Oh forbear, let me victory hear,

   And then thy commands I'll obey".'
   With a darksome thick film I encompassed his eyes,

   And bore him away in an urn;
   Lest the fondness he bore to his own native shore

   Should induce him again to return."'

   In addition to the above, lie wrote several other articles for the
   Pennsylvania Magazine, of considerable literary merit. These principally
   consist of a letter to the publisher on the utility of magazines in
   general; 'Useful and Entertaining Hints on the Internal Riches of the
   Colonies;' 'Reflections on the Death of Lord Clive;' and 'New Anecdotes of
   Alexander the Great.' The 'Reflections on the Death of Lord Clive,' I have
   not seen, though I have been at considerable pains to procure them; but I
   have been informed that they contain much originality of thought, and that
   they caused the work to be sought after with great avidity. He likewise
   wrote for the same publication an elegant little piece in the form of a
   poetical dialogue, between' a snowdrop and a critic, in which the former
   is made to describe the variety and pleasure intended to be conveyed to
   the public through the medium of the new work, in opposition to the
   cavilling objections of the latter. These productions are already in the
   possession of the public, and they serve to show the versatility of our
   author's disposition.''

   Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, and formerly a member of that congress which
   declared these states independent, in his letter to Cheetham, says that
   Paine came to this country with the design of opening a school for the
   instruction of young ladies in branches of literature not then generally
   taught. Paine's introduction to Mr. Aitkin appears to have been through
   Dr. Franklin's recommendations. There Dr. Rush met him; and afterward,
   being excited by an article in one of Mr. Aitkin's papers on the subject
   of the African slavery, he sought his acquaintance. And in that letter
   ascribes to himself suggesting to Paine the subject of his "Common Sense,"
   and the title. That letter, though highly favorable to Paine, is certainly
   egotistical, which renders this suggestion doubtful; especially as the
   object of Cheetham in getting that letter written to him, as well as
   others from different persons, was obviously to pare off, if possible, any
   part of Paine's reputation. Dr. Bush was clearly incorrect in one of his
   dates; and distinctly marks his prejudice in conclusively stating, that he
   declined to see Paine on his last return to this country, on account of
   the principles avowed in his "Age of Reason." This observation, though
   intended by Dr. Rush to exalt himself at the expense 'of Mr. Paine, and as
   such is published by Cheetham, is, in fact, highly important. It
   satisfactorily accounts for many of Paine's early sycophants deserting
   him, without any - dereliction of personal worth on his part.'

   Mr. Paine's acquaintance with Dr. Franklin; the object of his coming to
   this country_(to introduce a higher scale of education than that in use);
   his first employment (engaged or hired to edit a new magazine, and other
   periodicals published by Aitkin); the success and reputation of those
   publications, and his acquaintance with Dr. Rush as a consequence of his
   reputation; the very idea of Dr. Rush suggesting to Mr. Paine the subject
   of a pamphlet to act on the people, whether true or false, together with
   the circumstances just noted, mark Mr. Paine as then possessing literary
   attainments , in an eminent degree;' and ought to have preserved him
   against the vulgar abuse with which so many of the clergy and his
   theological opponents have assailed him. This attack on his literary
   character, successful in an extraordinary degree, depended on the
   suppression of his works; the presumption of the ignorance of those works
   by the body of the party addressed; and on the assumption of the power of
   the , clergy to prevent those works being read. It is remarkable, that
   Cheetham, dishonest in his purposes, and, comparatively with Paine, of
   small abilities, and very prejudiced and ignorant, makes also this charge,
   while he himself furnishes the moist satisfactory proofs to the contrary.
   In Cheetham's life is to be found the song we have already inserted. He
   likewise furnishes the following beautiful extract from the pen of Paine,
   published in an early number of Aitkin's magazine, from which the style of
   Paine may be inferred in what is called polite literature. (

   "In one of his lucubrations, adverting to the riches of the earth, the
   diligence which is necessary to discover, and 'the labor to possess them,
   he thus elegantly invites us to industry and research:- ,

   'Though nature is gay, polite, and generous abroad, she is sullen, .rude,
   and niggardly at home. Return the visit, and she admits you with all the
   suspicion of a miser, and all the reluctance of an antiquated beauty
   retired to replenish her charms. Bred up in antideluvian notions, she has
   not yet acquired the European taste of receiving visitants in her
   dressing-room: she locks and bolts up her private recesses with
   extraordinary care, as if not only resolved to, preserve her hoards, but
   to conceal her age, and hide the remains of a face that was young and
   lovely in the days of Adam. He that would view nature in her undress, and
   partake of her internal treasures, must proceed with the resolution of a
   robber, if not a ravisher. She gives no invitation to follow her to the
   cavern: the external earth makes no proclamation of the interior stores,
   but leaves to chance and industry the discovery of the whole. In such
   gifts as nature can annually recreate, she is noble and profuse, and
   entertains the whole world with the' interest of her fortunes, but watches
   over the capital with the care of a miser. Her gold and jewels lie
   concealed in the earth" in caves of utter darkness; the hoards of wealth,
   heaps upon heaps, mould in the chests, like the riches of a necromancer's
   cell. It must be very pleasant to an adventurous speculatist to make
   excursions into these Gothic regions; and in his travels he may possibly
   come to a caoinet locked up in some rocky vault, whose treasures shall
   reward his toil, and enable him to shine on his return as splendidly as
   nature herself.'"

   Were Paine's works known and read, the slander about his vulgar style
   would necessarily be confuted, without the labor of an advocate; and we
   regret the necessity of exposing the meanness which would suggest such a
   course to suppress a theological opponent. We are happy to find that his
   bitter enemies should be compelled to resort to falsehood for such a
   purpose. This conduct on the part of his personal enemies, ought then to
   awaken suspicion that this is not the only false and malicious slander
   under which Paine has too long lain.

   That a man who could write poetry so well should have written so little,
   is at once a mark of his good sense and strong resolution. Paine had
   remarked that poets were generally pretty triflers, and he suppressed a
   talent which he thought of little use to society. It is evident that Paine
   was not naturally fond of politics; he was led by circumstances, and a
   strong sense of justice and utility, into the course he took. The beauties
   of nature and the happiness of the human family occupied his mind. And the
   violence done to nature, and to human happiness by tyranny and
   superstition, together with the remarkable events of his day, deflected
   his course from the pursuits of peace, which he was so fitted to enjoy,
   into the more violent but useful course he did pursue. The man who could
   write the beautiful article we have just quoted, did not want the
   excitement of a storm or a revolution to give zest to life. Nothing could
   be more beautiful than either Paine's poetry or prose; he possesses not
   only strength and clearness, but a beauty of diction surpassed by no
   English writer we know: and if we wished to recommend a single model for
   fine English composition, we should certainly name Paine's writings as the
   best. ^' .

   We find Mr. Paine so completely identified with every great point in the
   revolution, and of the independence of this country, that we cannot do
   justice to him without giving a brief but clear account of those events,
   and the circumstances which led to them. Indeed, some of the most
   important events to be related were actually created or produced by him.
   Other men have followed events; Paine actually created them.'

   Soon after the discovery of this continent colonies began to be planted in
   North America. During the last century the French held the north or
   Canada, and large portions of the south and west. The English had several
   colonies in the middle, while other Europeans had made small settlements.
   These colonies were little regarded at first; they were safety-valves for
   daring spirits who were/discontented at home. The inhabitants formed an
   amalgamation, as they have done since, from every clime; but with the
   exception of those  transported to these shores for their crimes, they
   were industrious and independent, the general characteristics of all
   voluntary emigrants. Colonies have always been regarded by the English
   government only as they profit the mother-country, or rather the party
   governing. in the first place large grants of territory were made by
   various English sovereigns, either as rewards to favorites, or for some
   services received, and these grants being made without a correct knowledge
   of the country or rights of the natives, they were frequently given with
   uncertain boundaries; which, as we shall presently see, was the remote
   cause of the American war of independence. When the colonists, by dint of
   their own industry, could raise a surplus of some produce, they became
   importers of manufactured goods, and as such an object of attention to the
   government of Great Britain. But the interference of the British
   government was for their own benefit. They appointed governors, always
   sycophants of power, to be paid by the colonists. And they regulated their
   trade so as to produce to Great Britain the greatest advantage. A liberal
   policy, the mutual benefit of both parties, has never yet been conceived
   and executed by any ministry. The very principles of the British
   government laid the seeds of discontent, and established two interests:
   the governor pursued his own and the interests of Britain, or rather what
   he thought the interests of the British government; while the assemblies
   formed by the people, and their juries (for British settlers claimed
   British rights and customs), naturally preferred the interests of the
   colonies.

   In 1750, a company was formed in London called the Ohio company. They
   obtained a grant of six hundred thousand acres of land on the rivers Ohio
   and Mississippi. This grant was made without much regard to the Indian
   rights, and as it' cut off" the northern French territories from their
   southern and western, the French resisted it in practice. The trade of
   this company was chiefly carried on by the Virginians; but these traders
   were constantly annoyed by the French, who at last built a fort on the
   Ohio, and a French governor went so far as to order the seizure of every
   British subject found trading there. To counteract, this the Virginians
   formed << troop with which to protect their traders, and in this troop
   Washington was employed as a volunteer in the year 1753, and in the winter
   of that year undertook an arduous embassy to the French commandant,
   through a district that could not then be travelled by a horse, and at
   this early period marked out spots eligible for forts, especially Fort
   Duquesne. The embassy failing, force was attempted, and Washington became
   lieutenant to Colonel Fry. The French fort became the theatre of war,
   which was alternately taken and retaken; during which petty battles
   Colonel Fry died and left Washington in command; and in this situation the
   general of the revolution gained some fame from a masterly retreat before
   a very superior force of regular French soldiers. When the British
   government heard of these transactions they resolved to profit by them;
   and to dispossess the French of some of their territories through the
   means and at the expense of the colonies. They directed the governors of
   the several states to form a union, and raise a force; and that these
   united governors, assisted by two members of their respective council,
   should direct the whole, and draw upon the British treasury for the
   necessary expenses, in the first instance, but to be reimbursed by a tax
   laid on the colonies by the British parliament. This is the origin of the
   question which led to the disputes between Great Britain and the colonies,
   which ultimately led to independence. Franklin was consulted on this
   subject by Governor Shirley, and he at once declared the principle of
   taxation by the British parliament, in which they were not represented, to
   be unconstitutional and unjust. And thus he, too, as early as 1754, was
   initiated into the principles and into the subjects on which he so much
   distinguished himself at a period twenty years later.

   In 1755, the king of Great Britain, George II., sent out a large armament,
   Admiral Boscawen, to St. Lawrence, and General Braddock to Virginia,
   without a declaration of war, assuming that the French had commenced
   hostilities; and Washington became the aid-de-camp, of Braddock. Braddock
   led his army into the field, relying chiefly on his veterans , nay,
   actually despising the militia of the country, and neglecting the
   experience of Washington. Near Fort Duquesne he was caught in an Indian
   defile, and subject to a species of warfare he was unaccustomed to; and in
   that battle he was slain. Washington extricated the army from its perilous
   situation, retreated to Philadelphia, and afterward defended the frontiers
   of Virginia with much ability Pitt, afterward Lord Chatham, becoming
   minister in England, pushed the war with vigor; and sent out Lord Amherst,
   an excellent commander, assisted by Wolfe, General Forbes, and others. In
   1758, Forbes took Fort Duquesne, while Wolfe lost his life at, but took
   Quebec; and in 1760 Amherst took Montreal; and in 1762, the whole of
   Canada and French North America was yielded to the English, except New
   Orleans and the adjacent province. At this period, and in the following
   year, the colonists were perfectly content. They did not expect Indian
   aggression when not supported by French power. They were satisfied with
   Britain imposing on them governors, as representatives of royalty, while
   they enjoyed their colonial assemblies, their trial by jury, and other
   British rights; they were in fact, satisfied British subjects, approving
   of king, lords, and commons, and, like other British subjects, boasted of
   their liberty and their matchless constitution; which they really thought,
   for the opinion was common, that this mixed government united all that was
   excellent in each; while the parts checking each other, suppressed all
   that was vicious in royalty, aristocracy, or democracy. They were
   afterward to be taught the fallacy of these opinions by Thomas Paine. At
   this period, 1763, they were politically divided, as in England, into
   whigs and tories; or those who assumed to defend or extend the popular
   part of the government, and those who leaned to the aristocratical part,
   and favored the restriction of representation to property qualifications,
   and privileged or self-elected corporations: but the whigs predominated".
   It is to this period, 1763, that the colonists constantly refer in the
   early part of their revolution, before the declaration of independence, as
   the situation to which they wished to be restored; and therefore it
   deserves particular attention. Parliamentary taxation had been named, but.
   never enforced or acted upon; and in all their after-petitions all they
   ask, is the repeal of laws since 1763. "Place us," they repeatedly say,
   "in the situation in which we then were." No feeling of republicanism is
   perceived in their addresses; none in their public acts. Nothing of the
   kind was openly avowed by any of their leading men; and the individuals
   who did occasionally hint at such an event, were regarded as ultras; who,
   however correct in theory, held dangerous and impracticable doctrines: and
   these were the national feelings up to the very eve of the declaration of
   independence; just before which a change in the whole public sentiment was
   effected by the powerful pen of Thomas Paine, in his " Common Sense;"
   before which publication the only object avowed, even by the great men of
   the age, and seriously sought after by the rest of the people, was to be
   placed in the situation of 1763; to be restored to royal favor, and to
   enjoy their old British privileges (not rights).

   In 1764 commenced the British and colonial troubles. Mr. George Grenville
   had then become minister in Britain. He proposed to raise a revenue in the
   American colonies for the exclusive use of the British treasury. This was,
   of course, based upon the late expense of the war, borne by Great Britain,
   and in consonance with the scheme before noted, of future remuneration to
   the mother-country. About the same time that this- measure was talked of,
   other obnoxious acts were attempted. In Massachusetts, the governor
   published in support of the ministry, and attempted to establish a
   religious test, by giving offices only to episcopalians: on which occasion
   the people sent agents to England. On March 10, 1764, the stamp act was
   declared (not acted upon); which made certain transactions unlawful if not
   recorded on stamped paper, paid for as a tax. Against this Virginia led
   the way by petition and remonstrance;. Massachusetts passed legislative
   censures; and these two states took the lead in the whole of the
   preliminary contests and revolutionary war. The memorials were not
   received by parliament; but the parties were, suffered to be heard by
   council. Dr. Franklin at this time was agent for Massachusetts. In 1765
   the stamp act passed, and Boston went into mourning; manifested great
   public spirit; and her merchants agreed to import no goods till the unjust
   act should be repealed; while the lower classes committed some acts of
   violence. In Virginia a legislative action was had on it. Patrick Henry,
   then a young man, and scarcely acquainted with the rules of the assembly,
   waited for the action of some of the elder legislators; but finding them
   silent, or disposed to conciliate, he rose in his place, and proposed a
   series of resolutions, denouncing the stamp act as violations of their
   ancient charters, and destructive of British and American freedom, and
   disclaiming any other authority to enforce taxes than a general assembly.
   These resolutions, after considerable debate, were admitted, and served as
   a precedent for other states. The biographer of Patrick Henry, the late
   Mr. Wirt, relates, that after Mr, Henry's death, a sealed paper was found,
   directed to be read only when he had ceased to live. This paper contained
   the resolutions referred to, with remarks of Mr. Henry in his own
   handwriting. He observes: "The resolutions passed with a small majority;
   but the alarm spread throughout America. The ministerial party were
   overwhelmed: the great point of resistance to British taxation was
   universally established in the colonies. This brought on the war, which
   finally separated the two countries."

   In every chain of events there are some links of more importance than
   others; nay, essential to that chain. It is evident that Patrick Henry
   thought so of these resolutions: it is equally evident that he himself
   looked forward to a separation of the two countries, and regarded these
   resolutions as important to that object; yet on the face of them they only
   claim what every Briton claims, and independence and republicanism are not
   even hinted. The time had not yet come for such sentiments to be broached;
   nor how.it was to come was not then known, either to Patrick Henry or to
   any other patriot. The man who was destined to convert a nation by a few
   pages of "common sense," was then in obscurity; had just resigned
   staymaking for a paltry office in the English excise, and had never
   published an article: but the resolutions of Patrick Henry contributed to
   the crisis which brought Mr. Paine forward as an author; and as such we
   regard him as a chief link, too, in the chain of events which produced and
   consummated the revolution.

   In this same year, 1765, one James Otis, in Massachusetts, proposed a
   congress to be held in New York. A committee was formed to arrange this.
   South Carolina was the first to yield to the suggestion. The various
   governors, alarmed, prorogued the assemblies of Virginia, North Carolina,
   and Georgia: but committees of correspondence were established in each
   state; and thus the nucleus of organized resistance was formed. On the day
   the stamp act was to take effect, Boston had the bells tolled; public
   meetings were held, and fast days appointed. Violence in some cases was
   used: and to wear homespun became respectable, as marking national
   principle. The violent opposition to the stamp act induced inquiry in
   London. Franklin was examined at the bar of the house; and the whigs
   generally wished the repeal of the obnoxious stamp act. In the house of
   lords it is remarkable, that the bishops first recommended force to be
   used to the Americans; and the king did not wish the repeal of the act.
   The law was, however, repealed; and such were the feelings of the American
   people, that they manifested the most rapturous joy; and actually adulated
   the British government for not doing them so great an injustice as to
   impose on them taxes without representation. In Virginia a statue was
   voted to the king. From Massachusetts votes of thanks were agreed upon to
   the Duke of Grafton and Mr. Pitt; while Boston, and other parts the
   continent, illuminated; and rejoicings were everywhere heard. Well might
   Thomas Paine say, as he afterward did, in the "Crisis, No. VII.:" "I found
   the disposition of the people such, that they might be led by a thread and
   governed by a reed. Their attachment to Britain was obstinate; and it was
   at that time a kind of treason to speak against it. They disliked the
   ministry, but they esteemed the nation. Their ideas of grievance operated
   without resentment; and their single object was reconciliation."

   The foolish ministers again opened the wound by wishing the states to
   remunerate those who had suffered by the acts of violence in resisting the
   stamp act. And in 1767, when Mr. Pitt, or Lord Chatham, had again come,
   into power, but during his illness, an act was passed, "to restrain the
   legislative power in New York;" and soon after an act of perfidy awakened
   the jealousy and anger of the people; for some troops landed in Boston,
   alleging they were driven in precisely to that port by stress of weather.
   And in the same year, one Charles Townsend, in. the English parliament,
   publicly announced a plan for taxing the Americans by the English
   parliament, without giving them offence; and this plan, thus foolishly
   announced, consisted in imposing a duty on glass, paint, tea, and paper,
   to be imported into the colonies; and to assist this notable scheme, a
   board of admiralty was imposed on the colonies, to be paid by the natives,
   and whose operations cramped the colonies for the supposed benefit of the
   mother-country. These measures roused the people, and again awaked the
   worst feelings. Boston took the lead, closely followed by other parts. The
   mob committed acts of violence; while the better sort were loud in
   petitioning and remonstrating. Lord Chatham, who had been ill, resigned;
   Townsend died; and Lord North succeeded as English chancellor of the
   exchequer, and afterward as prime minister: and to his perseverance in a
   wrong course, for the sake of consistency^ England lost her colonies and
   America gained her independence. This, without merit to Lord North, is
   another important link in the chain which led to independence.

   In this year the spirit of resistance was fostered by some tolerable
   essays from one John Dickenson, Esq., published in a Philadelphia paper;,
   while the seizing of Hancock's sloop "Liberty," for smuggling, furnished
   the Bostonians the subject of a riot. To quell this, the governor,
   Bernard, sent for troops; and the respectable body of the people, at a
   large public meeting held at Faneuil Hall, proposed arming in fear of
   French invasion. This was undoubtedly a justifiable ruse , to meet the
   duplicity of the English ministers, whose troops landed by alleged stress
   of weather at Boston: it shows, too, that the Bostonians meant to fight
   for their liberty; though independence was never named, nor evidently
   scarcely conceived of, except by a very few.

   In 1769, Lord North, the English minister, obtained a good support both in
   the house of commons and in the house of lords; and he determined to
   maintain the supremacy of the English government in all things; and to
   prevent the effects of native juries, proposed trying civil officers,
   charged with murder or violence in the colonies, in support of the British
   government, in England. On this occasion all the ports agreed to suspend
   importations till this grievance should he removed.

   In 1769, the opposition to the arbitrary measures of the British
   government was so great in the colonies, and so powerful the effect of the
   non-importation agreement, that the ministers agreed to discontinue all
   the duties, except that on tea; thus perseveringly preserving the
   principle of taxation without representation, while they gave up the
   greater part of the, profit. The war, therefore, that succeeded was a war
   on principle, not amount, of taxation. On this occasion, Lord Chatham, who
   had partially recovered from his late illness, violently opposed the
   ministers. During this and the following year, the spirit of resistance
   increased, for the Americans were not to be duped by the repeal of taxes,
   while the principle or right of taxation was maintained. In Boston, where
   the presence of the soldiers was obnoxious, riots ensued; individual
   quarrels between soldiers and citizens became party quarrels; and three of
   the soldiers were killed by the ropemakers. In New York, the people
   erected liberty poles, which the soldiers cut down. But the most powerful
   incitement to opposition came from the pen of McDougal, a Scotchman, who
   boldly charged the assembly with betraying, the city and colony of New
   York, because they had discouraged the people and sanctioned the governor
   and the troops; not from attachment, but the necessity of supporting the
   laws. McDougal was thrown into prison, where he remained three months, and
   then dismissed without a trial. This fact shows the force of his writings,
   and we shall afterward find this man rendering essential service, for
   which the notoriety given him by this persecution qualified him.

   In 1771, Rhode Island showed considerable excitement. Philadelphia refused
   to receive the taxed tea; New York and other places followed, and the
   vessels, returned. But in Boston, where a quantity was assigned, some of
   the people dressed like Indians boarded the ships and threw three hundred
   and forty-two chests of tea into the sea. Yet, in this act, they only
   sought the liberties which the charters granted them; and in all their
   requests, they simply asked to be restored to the situation they were in
   in 1763. In all this violence the word independence was never pronounced.

   In 1774, North, enraged at the conduct of the Bostonians, procured bills,
   closing their harbor and destroying their ancient charter and
   constitution; thus punishing a whole people and people unborn for the
   specific acts of some. Against this Lord Chatham protests; and Burke the
   Irish orator made a brilliant speech. The career of the latter is
   identified with Paine; for he afterward became a pensioner to the British
   government, and apologist for the Bourbon family, and the opponent of the
   French revolution, and his work on this subject produced Paine's
   celebrated "Rights of Man." Boston, when her harbors were about to be
   closed, appealed to other cities and states. Virginia, ever ready and firm
   in the cause of opposition to arbitrary measures, appointed through her
   legislature the day for closing Boston harbor (1st of June, 1774), as a
   day of solemn fasting;, a measure always, efficacious, for it enlists
   religious enthusiasm, and presents to the opponent a ghostly power, of
   immense force, which feels no blows. Cromwell, Mahomet, and Thomas Becket,
   perfectly understood these tactics, and succeeded in their use. The
   governor dissolved the house in May, but the members formed an
   association, before even they had heard from Boston. They published, too,
   a manifesto, recommending that no East India produce be used, except
   saltpetre and spice. At New York, the parties were nearly equal; but the
   popularity of M'Dougal, the Scotchman before noticed, for his spirited
   writings, gave him a considerable influence, well supported as he was by
   Captain Sears. M'Dougal had both the honor to propose a second congress,
   the influence to get a committee for that purpose, and the address to
   carry this out, together with standing local committees: and this
   arrangement lasted till the declaration of independence. The various
   members to this congress, are the distinguished men, whose names are
   familiar to us as fathers of the revolution. This congress was generally
   appointed by the legislatures, and made legal, to effect which there were
   some previous secret meetings in Massachusetts. A committee had been
   appointed on the state of the province, which consisted of Samuel Adams,
   Joseph Warren, John Hancock, I. Cutting, Robert Treat Paine, and others.
   Before they reported they requested the doors might be shut; and then they
   proceeded to recommend a congress and an immediate decision. A spy of the
   governor affected a bowel complaint, and was suffered to depart; but
   neither he, nor the governor, nor his agent, was suffered to enter till
   the congress was confirmed; and the governor's dissolution of the
   assembly, made on the outside, was neither heard nor regarded. Virginia
   appointed Washington, Patrick Henry, &c., and declared herself ready to
   support Boston, but at the same time carefully instructed her delegates
   not to break with Britain; to support only their British privileges, or
   what they claimed as the rights of Englishmen. At this period, Rhode
   Island issued a motto, now familiar to our ears, but which at the same
   time is degraded by party politics, "United, we stand - divided, we fall."
   A motto, a song, a toast, or a pamphlet, will sometimes produce a
   unanimity, which much greater efforts have failed in. Georgia, of all the
   states, sent no deputies to this congress; but she, too, soon after, when
   the danger had not decreased, joined the union.

   It should be remembered, that about this time, Mr. Thomas Paine, by the
   advice of Dr. Franklin, then in England, was embarking for North America.
   It is evident that Franklin had a design of benefiting his country by this
   recommendation, in the precise way in which Paine effected it; for
   Franklin soon followed Paine, and almost immediately offered to put into
   his hands the materials for the eventful history of the times. Paine at
   that time was actually engaged on his "Common Sense," and soon after sent
   him the first copy to surprise him by showing that he had anticipated his
   designs and wishes. These events throw a sort of halo about the characters
   of these two men, highly respectable to both. When Franklin knew Mr.
   Paine, he was in London, ruined in his fortune and prospects; of no
   literary reputation, but for one pamphlet, in which he pleaded the
   unpopular cause of the excisemen. He had then no distinguished
   acquaintances, to whom he was indebted for an introduction. Franklin was
   at this time a doctor, distinguished for his learning, philosophy, and
   above all for his common sense. He was an old man, pithy and sententious,
   acquainted with the manner of addressing the people, himself an author
   (and authors are tenacious), yet he becomes the friend of Paine; advises
   him to come to this country, gives him letters which procure him at once a
   literary engagement, and on his return almost immediately offers to put in
   his hands the materials for the history of the times; while Paine was but
   a foreigner of a few months standing. What, then, are our conclusions, but
   that Franklin had the genius to discover Paine's peculiar tact and
   talents, and that he had the address to second Paine's wishes in coming to
   this country, without acquainting Paine with all his motives, and thus
   indirectly to effect what he himself wished? But what means had Franklin
   to know Paine? His pamphlet on the excise must have been the only source
   by which his qualities as a writer could be known; but that pamphlet is
   characteristic, and Franklin's conclusion must have been correct that he
   who could employ such good sense, in so powerful a manner, on such a bad
   subject, could, on a better subject, effect much. Franklin must, too, have
   discovered the sound and correct judgment of Paine, by conversations, and
   he must have believed in the correctness of his principles and extent of
   his knowledge, before he could think of giving into" his hands what his
   own countrymen thought himself (Franklin) so capable of. This conduct of
   Franklin, in preferring Paine to himself for this important object, while
   it reflects the greatest credit upon Paine's natural abilities,
   acquisitions, and moral virtues, redounds also to Franklin's glory. It is
   great men only that can afford to be generous; and Franklin in this
   preference marks a greatness of character, which never forsook him: while
   it marks also the calumniators of Paine, those who have attempted to
   present him to the public as a demoralized, vulgar, and illiterate man, as
   base unprincipled slanderers, whose calumnies are not, the less venomous
   for proceeding frequently from reverend persons.

   While Mr. Paine was preparing to leave his country, and during his voyage,
   events were ripening the crisis which should render his services valuable.
   Boston was distressed by a blockade; while the men, assisted even by the
   women, exercised themselves in arms. The governor of Boston, had removed
   to Salem; but the spirit of the people brought him back. His proclamations
   availed nothing. Meetings were held: and we cannot but observe the
   imperfect notions of political justice and civil rights, when among their
   complaints, they charge on the British government as a crime their doing a
   portion of justice to the catholics of Canada: such is the force of
   prejudice, religious instruction, and early impressions. The Bostonians
   were now indeed cruelly treated; but they were upheld by all the states;
   and the congress was now assembled (the latter part of September, 1774):
   Patrick Henry first spoke, and gave a manly tone to the meeting: events
   had presented the subject; it was not a matter of choice. The first
   question necessarily was: "Shall we make common cause with Boston?" and
   after a month's delay, or of protracted discussions, the congress (on Oct.
   6, 1774) resolved upon supporting Boston; still, however, praying a
   reconciliation. In their resolutions they declare themselves his
   majesty's' loyal subjects: they declare they are Englishmen, and want only
   Englishmen's rights: and they especially demand to be restored to the
   situation they were in in 1763; that is, after the French war, in which
   the French lost Canada, and before Sir George Grenville's stamp act. After
   a variety of useful resolutions, and a declaration not to support the
   slave-trade, the formation of committees, and the, establishment of
   provincial congresses, they dissolved; but resolved to meet again in May,
   1775, in Philadelphia. This then was not a dissolution, but an adjournment
   of the congress, which afterward declared for independence. At this time
   Thomas Paine must have embarked from England; for he arrived at
   Philadelphia in the winter of 1774. The local congress formed two
   committees: one of safety, which provided a militia; and the other a
   committee of supplies, which provided for them, and other necessary
   expenses. A new parliament in England was much divided. The king, in his
   speech, was unfavorable to the colonies: Lord Chatham, and the greatest
   men in the ministry, in favor of them: while Lord North still attempted to
   intimidate the people by unjust acts. He proposed a bill to restrict the
   people of New England from fishing; and performed other irritating acts of
   tyranny. In the colonies the military seized on several collections of
   arms and stores: but the militia being sanctioned by the local congresses,
   retaliated; as these assemblies declared the supplies collected in forts
   necessary for the safety of the state: Thus the people of Province, in New
   Hampshire, took the stores from Forts William and Maria. In Virginia
   Patrick Henry trained a company. At this period, Paine had arrived, and
   was engaged on various periodicals by Mr. Aitkin, of Philadelphia; in
   which situation he necessarily became acquainted with the local politics;
   while, from his recent arrival, he knew also public feeling in Great
   Britain: and thus he was becoming matured for what he afterward so well
   effected. Dr. Franklin had, too, returned to the colonies, and took the
   place of another deputy in Congress; Thomas Jefferson, likewise, took the
   place of another member: and thus events gradually led on the cause of
   independence; while not a word on the subject was uttered, even by those
   who wished it; for they had no hopes of seeing the people unanimous, and
   really expected that any proposition of the kind would subdivide those
   struggling against the tyranny of the British government.

   In April, 1775, an important event occurred. General Gage marched a few
   troops to Concord to seize some military stores. The people knew his
   design, and resolved on opposition. At Lexington a few militia were drawn
   up to watch his motions, but with strict orders not to molest him. These
   General Gage ordered to disperse; and after repeating his orders, fired on
   the. body, and killed eight militiamen. The militia dispersed; but some of
   them returned the fire. The British colonel (Smith) now moved on to
   Concord; during which time the militia assembled in great numbers,
   resolved to harass the troops on their return. The stores were removed
   from Concord, except a little flour, which Col. Smith destroyed, and then
   commenced a retreat; but the British. were met at every pass, and annoyed
   by secret foes along the whole road; and it is probable that the whole
   force of nine hundred men would have been destroyed, had not Lord Percy
   brought a re-enforcement to his rescue. In Virginia, about the same time
   the king's troops seized on a quantity of powder; but being pursued by
   Patrick Henry, who suddenly raised five thousand men, the value of the
   powder was recovered. In Massachusetts an army was immediately raised, and
   the command given to Putnam, who had fought in the Canada war. This man,
   who was one of the best revolutionary generals, had to lay by his leather
   apron when he became a general. The provincial troops now seized on the
   military stores wherever they could; and thus the example of the king's
   troops afforded the first means of getting supplies. In this year Colonel
   Ethan Allen and Arnold not only took the stores, but the fort of
   Ticonderoga, by surprise. The British at this time were commanded by Howe,
   Clinton, and Burgoyne. An offer of pardon was made to those who would lay
   down their arm, excepting Samuel Adams and Hancock: this last, as a
   compliment to the distinction shown him by the British, was made president
   of the congress: but he was more remarkable for his wealth and courage
   than abilities. On the 15th of June, Washington received the chief
   command: he declined a salary, and only wished his expenses paid.

   On the 16th of June, General Putnam ordered Colonel Prescott to take
   possession of Bunker's hill, with a thousand men. By some-mistake Breed's
   hill was occupied instead; and the general himself assisted in throwing up
   a breastwork during the night. To dispossess the Americans of this post,
   the famous battle of Bunker's hill was fought; which, though lost by the
   Americans, was so honorable to them, that it served as a watchword during
   the war, and as a grateful monument since. The men accustomed to the rifle
   repeatedly repulsed the enemy by reserving their fire till the approaching
   column was very near, and offered marks to be shot at. This coolness was
   altogether unexpected from raw troops; and could it have been exercised in
   all subsequent engagements, the war which succeeded would have been of
   short duration. In the summer of 1775, an Irish regiment arrived to the
   assistance of the Americans; but as they were destitute of both arms and
   provisions, they were not at first very useful to the cause, they came to
   serve. In July, Georgia sent deputies to congress; and in the same month
   congress published a declaration, earnestly desiring a reconciliation with
   Britain: they forwarded also a most humble petition to the king. The
   language of this petition is more humiliating than either the
   circumstances required, or the spirit of the people could suggest; and it
   was evidently drawn up to satisfy that class of people who always hope for
   the best; and who, on this occasion, hoped to obtain by begging, what
   others knew very well could only be obtained by courage. But these good
   meaning men would have been lost to the party had their wishes not been
   attended to. The action on this petition was afterward of great
   importance. In the meantime the congress did not trust to petitioning:
   they did something more substantial; they trained riflemen. In the south
   twelve volunteers travelled to Florida, and seized a vessel with fifteen
   thousand pounds of gunpowder in it; and giving the captain bills on
   congress, brought it off. In the south Lord Dunmore proposed to liberate
   the slaves, and arm them against their masters; but he either could not,
   or did not effect much in that way. In the north, an expedition was
   undertaken to Canada. St. John and Montreal were taken by Montgomery; but
   Colonel Allen was made prisoner, Montgomery was killed, and Arnold had his
   leg broken: the expedition was not finally successful. Letters of marque
   were also granted. On the other side, Lord Dunmore burned Norfolk, and
   threatened other places. At this period, late in the year 1775, Paine was
   engaged on his "Common Sense." About January, 1776, accounts were received
   that the petition forwarded to the king, from which so much was hoped by a
   part of the people, had been rejected; and no answer was deigned in reply.
   The same opportunities brought accounts of foreign troops (Hessians) being
   engaged to combat the colonies; and that a large armament was coming out.
   Mr. Penn had indeed been examined at the bar of the house of commons; and
   his examination proved that the colonists had then no thoughts of
   independence. They were now operated on by anger and fear: anger at the
   contemptuous treatment of their petition; and fear for the consequences of
   resistance, and at the force about to be brought against them. Yet none
   talked of independence, but a few of no weight in society; as none of the
   leaders would risk their popularity in supporting what appeared hopeless:
   yet Jefferson, Franklin, Patrick Henry, and others, evidently I wished
   independence: but this could only be supported by the unanimity of the
   body of the people; and these did not dare to dream of it. At this period
   of excitement, anger, and fear, Paine published his "Common Sense;" and
   boldly proposed independence, as the best means to get out of the
   difficulties into which they had now plunged; and as an object alone worth
   fighting for. This pamphlet effected wonders: it overcame difficulties
   apparently insurmountable, for it removed prejudices, generally a hopeless
   task: it convinced the people that the British constitution was not the
   best that could be, and that a government of kings, lords, and commons,
   might not be the essence of all that is excellent in each; but that the
   union might retain much that was bad in each: he satisfied the people of
   the disadvantages of carrying on war with a government whose authority was
   acknowledged: and he opened to them the resources within their power, and
   hinted at the possibility of getting foreign help as an independent
   nation. He produced, what his writings generally did produce, a change of
   opinion. The pamphlet was read from north to south; everybody talked about
   it; and each seemed surprised that he had not had the same thoughts, so
   clear did the propositions appear as explained in "Common Sense." The
   boldness of the language, indeed, alarmed those who are in the habit of
   understanding for other people: they had no objection to it themselves,
   but they thought the people not yet prepared for such opinions; and some
   ludicrous scenes occurred. The people; indeed, were not prepared: they
   read first from curiosity, and then became convinced. Paine absolutely
   produced the events he sought. He wanted a declaration of independence,
   and he produced the wish for it. Clio Rickman observes, in, a note on
   Cheetham's life of Paine, that-

   "When 'Common Sense' arrived at Albany the convention of New York was in
   session: General Scott, a leading member, alarmed at the boldness and
   novelty of its arguments, mentioned his fears to several of his
   distinguished colleagues, and suggested a private meeting in the evening
   for the purpose of writing an answer. They accordingly met, and Mr.
   M'Kesson read the pamphlet through. At first it was deemed both necessary
   and expedient to answer it immediately, but casting about for the
   necessary arguments they concluded to adjourn and meet again. In a few
   evenings they assembled, but so rapid was the change of opinion in the
   colonies at large in favor of independence, that they ultimately agreed
   not to oppose it." 'l

   When Mr. Paine saw the avidity with which his book was read, as he had not
   published for interest but principle, he generously gave the copyright to
   every state. His own observations on the subject are these:-

   "Politics and self-interest have been so uniformly connected that the
   world from being so often deceived has a right to be suspicious of public
   characters. But with regard to myself, I am perfectly easy on this head. I
   did -not at my first setting out in public life, nearly seventeen years
   ago, turn my thoughts to subjects of government from motives of interest;
   and my conduct from that moment to this proves the fact. I saw an
   opportunity in which I thought I could do some good, and I followed
   exactly what my heart dictated, I neither read books, nor studied other
   people's opinions-I thought for myself. The case was this:-

   During the suspension of the old government in America, both prior to and
   at the breaking out of hostilities, I was struck with the order and
   decorum with which everything was conducted, and impressed with the idea
   that a little more than what society naturally performed was all the
   government that was necessary. On these principles I published the
   pamphlet 'Common Sense.'

   The success it met with was beyond anything since the invention of
   printing. I gave the copyright up to every state in the Union and the
   demand run to not less than one hundred thousand copies, and I continued
   the subject under the title of 'American Crisis,' till the complete
   establishment of the American revolution.'

   The disinterested conduct of Mr. Paine, considering the enormous quantity
   that was sold, is a remarkable trait in his character, and ode which
   should excite in the breast of every American citizen a lively sense of
   gratitude. Paine, at this time, was yet a poor man. It would have been
   perfectly honorable in him to take the ordinary profit. That profit on
   "Common Sense" alone must have been enormously large, and a large profit
   could have been made on each number of the "Crisis;" and Paine, without
   the slightest imputation on his character, could have realized a handsome
   fortune, while he rendered a most important service to his adopted
   country. We know of no example of the kind; some rich men publish for
   principle, but we know of no poor man, who had the temptation of
   popularity to anything like the extent which Mr. Paine enjoyed by this
   publication, who gave to the public his' copyright. He stands, therefore,
   alone, as a remarkable instance of great generosity and public spirit. Mr.
   Paine was never an extravagant man. While in public life, and in the
   enjoyment of a moderate competency, he lived like a gentleman in this
   country, in England, and in France: but when in retirement, both in France
   and in this country, at a late period of his life, when many of his former
   friends avoided an intimacy for fear of the unpopularity of his religious
   opinions, he then evidently became careless of appearances, and, though
   always well clothed, comfortably lodged, and possessed of the comforts of
   life, yet, in his old age, his style of living was mean. Yet what can we
   say of the meanness of a man, who thus nobly gives up thousands, glorying
   in the act, and persevering in it, in all his successive political and
   theological publications! The only answer is that he had not an
   extravagant taste, and this enabled him to be generous; while this taste,
   at variance with the taste of others in equal circumstances, will
   necessarily appear parsimonious. Had Paine been less parsimonious, he
   would probably have been less generous. His capability of living on a
   little, evidently suggested the idea that great riches were unnecessary in
   a private situation.

   "The' time was now arrived," says Sherwin, "when our author was to take an
   active as well as a decisive part in public affairs. The declaration of
   independence had removed the scene of political warfare from the closet to
   the camp, and it was now become necessary to try the strength of public
   patriotism by bringing it into the field of military operations. Warlike
   preparations were immediately set on foot by the Americans. Many
   individuals of respectability volunteered their services in support of
   their country's freedom, and among the foremost of them was Mr. Paine. In
   this capacity he was introduced to the friendship of the Marquis de la
   Fayette, who was likewise serving as a volunteer in the American army. The
   officers treated our author with every possible mark of respect; at their
   tables he was hailed as a welcome guest, and General Washington himself
   neglected no opportunity of showing the high opinion he entertained of his
   talents and integrity."

   Cheetham, in spite of his prejudices, gives the following brief account of
   Paine's services at this time:-

   "When 'Common Sense' was written, the friends of independence were not
   republicans. Paine's invectives against monarchy were intended against the
   monarchy of England, rather than against monarchy in general, and they
   were popular in the degree to which the measures and designs of the
   British cabinet were odious. The question, when no alternative but
   colonial vassalage or national independence presented itself, was one
   merely of independence, for, as Mr. Adams truly remarked, the colonists
   had no wish but for the 'immemorial liberties of their ancestors.' To this
   may be added the observation of Dr. Franklin, that they could not even
   hope for a government under which they could enjoy liberties more
   precious.

   On the fourth of July, 1776, congress declared the colonies 'free and
   independent states,' which was as soon after the publication of 'Common
   Sense,' Paine remarks, ' as the work could spread through such an
   extensive country.'

   Paine now accompanied the army of independence as a sort of itinerant
   writer, of which his pen was an appendage almost as necessary and
   formidable as its cannon. Having no property, he fared as the army fared,
   and at the same expense, but to what mess he was attached I have not been
   able to learn, although, from what I hear and know, it must, I think,
   though he was sometimes admitted into higher company, have been a
   subaltern one. When the colonists drooped he revived; them with a
   'Crisis.' The first of these numbers he published early in December, 1776.
   The object of it was good, the method excellent, and the language suited
   to the depressed spirits of the army, of public bodies, and of private
   citizens, cheering. Washington, defeated on Long Island, had retreated to
   New York, and been driven with great loss from Forts Washington and Lee.
   The gallant little army, overwhelmed with a rapid succession of
   misfortunes, was dwindling away, and all seemed to be over with the cause,
   when scarcely a blow had been struck. 'These,' said the 'Crisis,' `are the
   times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot
   will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that
   stands it Now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny,
   like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us,
   that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph: what we obtain
   too cheap we esteem too lightly.'

   The number was read in the camp, to every corporal's guard, and in the
   army and out of it had more than the intended effect. The convention of
   New York, reduced by dispersion occasioned by alarm, to nine members, was
   rallied and reanimated. Militiamen, who, already tired of the war, were
   straggling from the army, returned. Hope succeeded to despair,
   cheerfulness to gloom, and firmness to irresolution. To the confidence
   which it inspired may be attributed much of the brilliant little affair
   which in the same month followed at Trenton."

   The impression which this first number of the "Crisis" made on the public
   mind, is evident by the very first sentence being handed down already to
   two generations, as a sort of watchword: "These are the times that try
   men's souls;" yet the dastardly enmity to Paine has suppressed the author.
   Thousands use this expression, while individuals only know the origin of
   it. Yet the fact of this expression being thus handed down even in spite
   of the personal prejudices against the man, clearly shows the impression
   this well-timed pamphlet must have made on the nation. The extract we have
   given scarcely shows the facts: the American army was dispirited they were
   even brought into contempt by their unsoldierlike appearance in comparison
   to the well-clothed, well-fed regulars, preceded by elegant bands of
   music. The militia whose time was up were returning in disgust; the army
   appeared<< disbanded. It was Paine's task to reinstate it, to place honor
   where it was deserved, and to convert the despairing, degraded, because
   despised soldier, into a warm patriot, and to convert a feeling of scorn
   into one of encouragement; and this task Paine admirably performed.

   "The affair of Trenton elevating American confidence," as Cheetham
   remarks, "and breathing caution into the British army, Paine, in January,
   1777, congratulated the 'free and independent states' in a second number
   of the 'Crisis.' It is addressed to Lord Howe, and ridicules his
   proclamation, 1 commanding all congresses, committees. &c., to desist and
   cease from their treasonable doings.' Against the king and his purposes,
   it is full of invective, but of a sort rather popular than exquisite.
   Fortunately for the United States the British commander-in-chief dealt
   more in impotent proclamations than in the efficacy of arms. Washington's
   retreat to Trenton was a compulsive one. He had not from choice and by
   military skill drawn the Hessians into the toil in which they were
   ensnared. I do not believe that even a number of the 'Crisis' could have
   saved the American army and cause from annihilation, if Howe had been an
   active and persevering, an enlightened and energetic commander.
   Washington's patience and care, his admirable coolness and prudence,
   although often, in the course of the war, provoked to battle by a thousand
   irritating circumstances, by internal faction, and by British sneers,
   saved America to freedom; while the idle dissipation of Howe, his devotion
   to licentious pleasures, his unmartial spirit and conduct, lost it to the
   crown.

   On the nineteenth of April, 1777, he published, at Philadelphia, the third
   number of the 'Crisis.' As there had been no military operations from the
   capture of the Hessians at Trenton, it was devoted to an examination of
   occurrences since the declaration of independence, and to a repetition of
   the arguments which he had employed in 'Common Sense' in favor of
   independence."

   At this time, or rather on the 17th of April, Mr. Paine was elected by
   congress secretary to the committee for foreign affairs. No man could be
   more suitable for this situation: and ably did he serve it. The duties of
   his office corresponded with that of the English secretary for foreign
   affairs. He stood in the same relation to the committee as that officer
   did to the cabinet. All foreign communications were addressed to Mr.
   Paine, and by him perused, and then laid before the committee by whose
   instructions he acted. In his foreign communications he assumed the same
   title which the British minister did who performed the same task. On this
   subject Cheetham is very spiteful, and supposes he did so from vanity; and
   insidiously mentions the amount of the paltry salary which Mr. Paine
   received, as a sort of presumptuous pittance that he ought not, with such
   a salary, to call himself secretary for foreign affairs." But the fact is,
   it was policy in Mr. Paine to do so: he wrote then in the style of an
   equal, and assumed a proper dignity useful to his adopted country.

   In the early part of September, 1777, Sir William Howe and Cornwallis were
   pushing on the line of the Brandywine toward Philadelphia; and to satisfy
   the public mind, Washing-ton was obliged to risk a battle. He did so, and
   lost the battle; but being ably assisted by La Fayette, and other French
   and Polish officers, he made good his retreat, without any very serious
   injury. On this occasion Paine published his fourth "Crisis;" short, but
   admirably adapted to the purpose; and the morale or confidence of the army
   increased, so that, could they have fought the battle over again, the
   soldiers would have done it.

   While Washington was engaged with Howe and Cornwallis near Philadelphia,
   General Gates was watching the movements of Burgoyne, descending the
   Hudson; and fell upon him at Saratoga, where the militia simultaneously
   joined him; and Burgoyne, weakened by his march, and disappointed in the
   junction of the New York army with him in this neighborhood, was.
   surrounded, and obliged to surrender. Howe, aware of this, and not being
   able to bring Washington to a general engagement, became predatory in his
   warfare: on which occasion Paine brought out his fifth "Crisis;" which, as
   Sherwin remarks -

   "Was published at Lancaster, in Pennsylvania, March, 1778. It consists of
   a letter addressed to General Sir William Howe, and an 'Address to the
   Inhabitants of America.' The advantages gained by General Howe he
   considers of so trifling a nature, as rattier to prove the impotence of
   his troops, than to show their ability to prosecute their object. He cites
   the retreat of the British as a confirmation of this conclusion. He
   ridicules, with considerable force, the vanity of attaching importance to
   titles, and the pretensions which Sir William had set forth to the esteem
   of the Americans. He is very severe on the moan and cowardly conduct of
   Sir William in distributing forged continental bills. If this charge were
   true, and the evidence given as too conclusive to admit of its being
   doubted, it is a most disgraceful circumstance to those employed in
   carrying on the war. In the conduct of an army there are certain acts
   which we consider dishonorable, and which a commander who values his
   character will always be careful to prevent. These are not laid down by
   any law; because, when countries are at war with each other, law is
   totally out of the question: they depend on the disposition of a general
   and the discipline of his troops. But of all the low, drivelling practices
   that were ever resorted to by an army to distress a people with whom it
   was at war, the project of forging their bills is the most despicable. It
   is in a moral sense what assassination is in a physical sense; and ought
   never to be resorted to except as a measure of retaliation. It is,
   however, impossible to reprobate, the practice in stronger terms than
   Paine has done in the publication before us. 'You, sir,' says he, in the
   address to Sir William, 'have abetted and patronised the forging and
   uttering counterfeit continental bills. In the same New York newspapers in
   which your own proclamation under your master's authority was published,
   offering or pretending to offer pardon and protection to the inhabitants
   of these states, there were repeated advertisements of counterfeit money
   for sale; and persons who have come officially from you, and under
   sanction of your flag, have been taken up in attempting to put them off. A
   conduct so basely mean in a public character is without precedent or
   pretence. Every nation on earth, whether friends or enemies, will join in
   condemning you. It is an incendiary war upon society, which nothing can
   excuse or palliate: an improvement upon beggarly villany; and shows an
   inbred wretchedness of heart, made up between the venomous malignity of a
   serpent, and the spiteful imbecility of an inferior reptile.' The severity
   of these reproaches finds an apology in the circumstances of the case; for
   though the language is harsh, it is nevertheless just; and the fault lies
   with the person who deserves, not with him who applies it.

   There, perhaps, is not any species of composition which, in a few years,
   becomes so dry and insipid as disquisitions upon the politics of the day;
   and those writers who have been able to give to such a subject a permanent
   interest, must be allowed to possess talents of a superior description.
   The ability displayed by Paine in the productions before us, has conferred
   a lasting importance on events which, passing through the icy medium of
   distant history, would have met with but little attention. He makes us
   feel as well as see the objects he is writing upon; and though in some
   instances he does not attempt to give his language that high polish of
   which it is susceptible, yet we soon discover the intrinsic value of his
   sentiments, and we respect the rough exterior as an evidence of the
   author's sincerity, while a multitude' of graces would only tend to bring
   his motives into suspicion.

   The subsequent part of the letter to General Howe discovers a fund of
   thought, penetration, and feeling. Though 1 intend to be as brief as
   possible in making extracts from works which cannot be properly
   appreciated unless they are perused entire, yet the following is so
   prophetically true, that I cannot resist the temptation of quoting it:-

   `There is something in meanness which excites a species of resentment that
   never subsides; and something in cruelty which stirs up the heart to the
   highest agony of human hatred. Britain has filled up both these characters
   till no addition can be made, and hath not reputation left with us to
   obtain credit for the slightest promise. The will of God hath parted us;
   and the deed is registered for eternity. When she shall be a spot scarcely
   visible among nations, America shall flourish, the favorite of Heaven, and
   the friend of mankind.'

   If the implicit supporters of arbitrary power and orthodox despotism will
   not admit Paine to have prophesied from inspiration, it is to be hoped
   they will allow hint to possess the merit of sound judgment and rational
   reflection. At all events, his calumniators cannot deny that the foregoing
   prediction is fast verging toward its fulfilment. Our author concludes No.
   V. with an address to the inhabitants of America. In this he exhorts them
   to fresh perseverance; and, after an elaborate description of the
   situation of the respective armies, he closes by proposing a plan for
   recruiting the American forces.

   The sixth number of the 'Crisis' was published at Philadelphia, in
   October, 1778. The subject is a letter to the earl of Carlisle, General
   Clinton, and William Eden, Esq., British commissioners at New York. These
   gentlemen, in opposition to all the dictates of reason and experience, had
   issued a proclamation, calling upon the rebellious Americans to renew
   their allegiance to the king of Great Britain, whom they pompously
   described as the 'rightful sovereign' of America. The treaty which had
   recently been concluded between, America and France, appears to have been
   the principal cause of this fresh display of folly. The pains which the
   poor commissioners were at to make themselves and their royal master
   appear ridiculous, were in strict conformity with the blundering policy
   which had given rise to their appointment; and their promises and pardons,
   their flattery and threats, were alike unavailing. The government of
   England, instead of being looked upon as an affectionate parent, was now
   regarded as an unnatural monster, who had sought to strangle her infant
   offspring. Even those who at first had been the most zealous friends of
   reconciliation, were by this time deprived of all their long-cherished
   hopes; for they clearly saw that a reunion with the British government
   would be the certain forerunner of the most abject slavery. The
   pretensions and offers of the commissioners were, therefore, either
   spurned as an insult to the people, or ridiculed as a silly display of
   imaginary power. And when to this state of things we add the previous
   capture of General Burgoyne, their situation becomes truly pitiable. With
   such materials to work upon, it is impossible that a man of any ability
   would write ill; and we therefore need not wonder that they furnished
   Paine with the groundwork of one of the best numbers of the 'Crisis.' As
   an analysis of this production would not tend in any degree to do justice
   to the writer's merits, I shall avoid making extracts from this as well as
   the subsequent numbers; recommending to the reader an attentive perusal of
   the whole, as the only mode of enabling himself to appreciate the talents,
   perseverance, and patriotism of the author.

   The seventh number of the ' Crisis' was published at Philadelphia, Nov.
   21, 1778. It consists of a letter to the people of England. The object of
   this number appears to have differed in some degree from that of its
   immediate predecessor: the one being written for the purpose of convincing
   the government, and the other of proving to the people the improbability
   of subduing America. The delusive hopes with which the ministry had amused
   the nation, the disgrace which must attend the hitherto invincible armies
   of England, and the wickedness of any man in even wishing those armies to
   be successful, are exposed with an ability which must have been most
   severely felt by the enemies, and warmly applauded by the friends of
   independence. The number likewise contains some excellent reflections on
   the subject of national .honor and the mischievous effects of national
   vanity.

   In January, 1779, our author resigned his situation of secretary for
   foreign affairs. This resignation was in consequence of a disagreement
   which had taken place between the congress and Mr. Paine, respecting a
   person of the name of Silas Deane. In the early part of the war, it
   appears that this man had been employed by the committee for foreign
   affairs as an agent in France, for the purpose of obtaining supplies,
   either as a loan from the French government, or, if he failed in this, to
   purchase them as regular merchandise. Without waiting the issue of his
   separate mission, he was soon after nominated with Dr. Franklin and Mr.
   Lee, who proceeded to the court of Louis for the same purpose. The French
   monarch, more perhaps from his hostility to the English government, than
   from any attachment to the American cause, gladly acceded to the request;
   and the supplies were immediately furnished from the king's arsenal. As
   France was then to all appearance upon amicable terms with England, a
   pledge was given by the American commissioners that the grant should
   remain a secret. The. supplies were accordingly shipped in the name of a
   Mr. Beaurnarchais, and consigned to ah imaginary house in the United
   States., Deane, taking advantage of the secresy which had been promised by
   the commissioners, presented a claim for compensation in behalf of himself
   and Beaumarchais; thinking, perhaps, that the auditing committee would
   prefer a compliance with his fraudulent demand, rather than expose their
   ally, the king of France, to a rupture with England. At first there
   appeared an inclination to comply with his request; and Mr. Paine,
   perceiving this, and knowing the circumstances of the case, resolved on
   laying the transaction before the public. He accordingly wrote for the
   newspapers several essays, under the title of 'Common Sense to the Public
   on Mr. Deane's Affairs.' In these he exposed, without ceremony, the
   dishonest designs of Deane. .The business, in consequence, soon became a
   subject of general conversation: the demand was rejected by the auditing
   committee, and Deane himself soon afterward absconded to England.

   For this piece of service to the Americans our author was thanked and
   applauded by the body of the people; but by this time a party had begun to
   form itself, whose principles, if not the reverse of independence, were
   the reverse of republicanism. These men, as individuals, had long envied
   the popularity of Mr. Paine, but from their want of means to check or
   control it, they had hitherto remained silent. An opportunity was now
   offered for venting their spleen. Mr. Paine, in expressing his indignation
   against the claims of Mr. Deane, had mentioned one or. two circumstances
   that had come to his knowledge in consequence of his office; a plan was
   immediately formed for depriving him of his situation; and, accordingly, a
   motion was made by one of the members for an order to bring him before the
   congress. Mr. Paine readily attended; and on being asked whether the
   articles in question were written by him, he replied that they were. He
   was then directed to withdraw. A,s soon as he had left the house, a member
   arose and moved: 'That Thomas Paine be discharged from the office of
   secretary to the committee for foreign affairs;' but the motion was lost
   upon a division. Mr. Paine then wrote to congress, requesting that he
   might be heard in his defence, and Mr. Laurens made a motion for that
   purpose, which was negatived. The next day he sent in his resignation,
   concluding with these words: 'As I cannot, consistently with my character
   as a freeman, submit to be censured unheard; therefore, to preserve that
   character and maintain that right, I think it my duty to resign the office
   of secretary to the committee for foreign affairs; and I do hereby resign
   the same.

   This conduct on the part of the congress may, in some degree, be
   attributed to a desire to quiet the fears of the French ambassador, who
   had become very dissatisfied in consequence of its being known to the
   world that the supplies were a present from his master. To silence his
   apprehensions, and preserve the friendship of the French court, they
   treated Paine with ingratitude. This they acknowledged at a future period
   by a grant; of which we shall have occasion to speak in its proper place.

   Our author was now deprived of the means of obtaining a livelihood; and
   not being disposed to render his literary labors subservient to his
   personal wants, he engaged himself as clerk to Mr. Biddle, an attorney at
   Philadelphia.

   Mr. Paine's dispute with the congress produced no change in his
   patriotism. On every occasion he continued to display the same degree of
   independence and resolution which had produced his first animated efforts
   in favor of the republican cause. Neither personal altercation, nor
   pecuniary embarrassments, had any effect upon his principles. He had
   enlisted, himself as a volunteer in the American cause; and he vindicated
   her rights under every change of circumstance, with the unabated ardor of
   a freeman. N

   Soon after the resignation of his secretaryship, our author was chosen
   clerk of the legislature of Pennsylvania. This appointment is a proof
   that, though he had some enemies, he had many friends; and that the
   insidious insinuations of the former had not been enabled to weaken the
   attachment of the latter.

   In March, 1780, Mr. Paine published the eighth number of the ' Crisis.'
   The subject of this is a second address to the people of England. It is
   written much in the same style as the one which preceded it. From all that
   had taken place, it was apparent that America was beyond the reach of
   conquest; and seeing this, he very properly asks the English people what
   their motive was in protracting a contest which appeared to be fraught
   with nothing but self-destruction. He dwells with great emphasis on the
   calamities of war; and represents the people of England as ignorant of any
   of its effects, except that of taxation. He could not have had a better
   opportunity of depicting the miseries of military contention; and the,
   portrait he has drawn is as natural as life.

   In June following, he published at Philadelphia the ninth number of the
   'Crisis.' This seems to have been written for the purpose of consoling the
   Americans for the loss of Charlestown, which had recently fallen into the
   hands of the British. He reasons with considerable force and ingenuity on
   the insignificance of such a conquest^; and consoles his readers by
   reflecting that similar misfortunes were unavoidable during a state of
   local warfare; and that they were in some measure advantageous, inasmuch
   as, without endangering the real safety of the country, they were
   sufficiently injurious to prevent its being lulled into the lap of false
   security.

   In the beginning of October, 1780, our author published, at Philadelphia,
   a long discussion on the subject of taxes, under the title of ' A Crisis
   Extraordinary.' He draws a comparison between the extent of taxation in
   the respective countries of -England and America: he shows, from
   calculation, that the former exceed the latter in more than a tenfold
   degree; and concludes by recommending the plan of congress; that of
   funding its paper, and issuing a new coinage as a substitute.
   Notwithstanding the determined hostility of the Americans toward the
   English, their army was considerably oppressed for want of pecuniary
   means; and to this cause, more than to any other, we may attribute the
   apparent hardiness of their operations about this period. In the course of
   his reflections, he takes an opportunity of repeating his former arguments
   against the tyranny, folly, and avarice of the English government: he
   treats the difficulties of the country as affairs of a temporary
   character, which a little privation and perseverance would speedily
   remove.

   While those financial discussions were pending, the congress resolved upon
   attempting a more effectual plan for removing the public embarrassments,
   than could be derived from any application of the internal resources of
   the states. Mr. Paine 'drew up a letter to Count Vergennes, stating the
   difficulties in which the country was placed; and concluding with a
   request that France would; either as a subsidy, or as a loan, supply the
   United States with a million sterling, and continue that supply annually
   during the war. This letter Mr. Paine showed first to M. Marbois, the
   French minister's secretary. He objected to the application by observing,
   that 'a million sent out of a nation exhausted it more than ten millions
   spent in it.' Our author was not to be baffled in his design by this
   rebuff; and he accordingly presented his scheme to Mr. Isard, member for
   South Carolina. This gentleman readily agreed to bring the subject before
   congress; which he did very shortly afterward. The congress, after-a very
   short discussion, acceded to the proposal; and a mission to the court of
   France was resolved upon immediately.

   Colonel Laurens, son of the late president of congress, was appointed to
   negotiate the affair; and, at his anxious solicitation, Mr. Paine
   accompanied him to Paris. They sailed in February, 1781, and arrived in
   France the following month. Their mission was attended with more success
   than was expected. They obtained six millions of livres as a present, and
   ten millions as a loan, borrowed in Holland on the security of France.
   They sailed from Brest at the beginning of June, and arrived at Boston' in
   August; having under their charge two millions and a half in silver,
   exclusive of a ship and brig laden with clothing and military stores.

   From the account which Mr. Paine gives of himself, it appears that he had,
   some time previous to this, formed a design of coming over to England, for
   the purpose of exposing to the people the folly and perversity of their
   rulers. 'I was,' he observes, ' strongly impressed with the idea, that if
   I could get over to England without being known, and only remain in safety
   till I could get out a publication, that I could open the eyes of the
   country with respect to the madness and stupidity of its
   government.'[Rights of Man] He would have carried his intention into
   effect almost immediately, but for the advice of his friend General
   Greene; who, it appears, fully approved of the plan: but the affair of
   Arnold and Andre happening shortly afterward, the general altered his
   mind, and wrote very pressingly to Mr. Paine to dissuade him from his
   design. With some reluctance he consented to adopt the general's advice;
   both parties conceiving that his personal safety would be greatly
   endangered by any attempt at that time to carry his scheme into practice.
   *

   During our author's voyage to France with Col. Laurens, another event
   occurred which confirmed the propriety and practicability of this project.
   An English packet, from Falmouth to New York, was taken by a French
   privateer; and, owing to an artful stratagem of the French captain, the
   government despatches in the packet were secured and brought on board his
   vessel. They were sent to Paris to the French minister, Count Vergennes;
   who, after reading them, presented them to Col. Laurens and Mr. Paine, to
   be conveyed to America for the information and use of congress.

   What the contents of these despatches were is not known; but it appears
   that they afforded Mr. Paine a better opportunity of judging of the
   perfidy and intrigue of the English cabinet than could have been done by
   any other means. This circumstance renewed his former plan respecting the
   British government; but Colonel Laurens being unwilling to return alone,
   Mr. Paine was induced to postpone its execution to a more favorable
   opportunity."

   Previous to this period the French had declared in favor of the United
   States. The campaign of 1778 was arranged in Paris, and a French army and
   fleet co-operated with Washington; yet, after the capture of Burgoyne no
   decisive action was fought till the capture of Cornwallis in 1780. The war
   for several year's was chiefly predatory in the south, and General Howe,
   Cornwallis, and the traitor Arnold, laid waste the states of South
   Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia; but their troops were continually
   harassed by the activity and skill of the American general, Greene who
   from a blacksmith became one of the best generals in the service of the
   states. During this year (1780), the finances were in the most wretched
   state; the paper-money depreciated to a most alarming extent, and it was
   evidently impossible to raise the supplies by taxes. Washington's private
   accounts to the congress clearly revealed the miserable, state of the
   army, while their published accounts deceived the enemy. Mr. Paine, by his
   "Common Sense," had previously' produced the declaration of independence,
   and the unanimity of the people. The "Crisis," published as we have seen
   from time to time, preserved that unanimity, and in a great measure
   regulated the tone of public feeling. But Mr. Paine was not backward in
   his personal services: on one occasion when with the army, he formed a
   plan to destroy a part of the enemy's shipping, and offered to conduct the
   enterprise. This he explains in one number of the "Crisis," and shows that
   his object was not merely to effect a loss to the English, but to abate
   their pride in the strength of their navy, and to encourage the spirits of
   the people, who thought the British ships of-war impregnable. When the
   finances were in the worst state, before Mr. Paine went to France, and
   when Washington feared the immediate dissolution of the army for want of
   pay and necessaries, Mr. Paine began a private subscription with five
   hundred dollars, all the money he could then raise, including his salary
   as secretary. The subscriptions on this occasion reached the large amount
   of three hundred thousand pounds; and this fund converted into a bank
   supplied the immediate wants of the government, and enabled Washington to
   commence the preparation to encompass and subdue Cornwallis, and thus
   bring an end to the war. These preparations were facilitated by a
   knowledge of the success of Colonel Laurens's mission to France, assisted
   by Mr. Paine: and the supplies actually arriving while Washington's army
   was manoeuvering for the last great exploit, had, probably a considerable
   effect on the success of those manoeuvres. This was evidently the opinion
   of Mr. Paine. New York was in possession of the enemy, the headquarters of
   Clinton. The anxious solicitude of Washington was to recover this city.
   Washington's plans were apparently all directed to this object; and the
   chief attention of Clinton consequently bent on the retention of that
   place. Cornwallis was then at Yorktown, Va., on the Susquehannah. The
   French fleet, by pretending to fly, drew out the English fleet till a
   re-enforcement entered the Chesapeake, and then returned to take and keep
   possession of that bay. Troops marching from the south did not alarm
   Clinton; re-enforcements from the west he was perhaps ignorant of; and the
   troops progressing down the Hudson from the north he supposed destined
   to-join Washington near New York. When these collections of troops were
   all within a few days' march of the Susquehannah and Yorktown, Washington
   suddenly turned his own force in that direction. Clinton thought it a
   ruse, and remained inactive and thus was Cornwallis suddenly surrounded,
   in every direction, by sea and land, by the regulars, their auxiliaries,
   the French and Poles, and by the militia. Cornwallis, unprepared for a
   siege, surrendered before he could be relieved by Clinton; and thus a
   virtual end was put to the war, for till peace was restored, the British
   merely kept possession of New York, and one or two other stations, holding
   in subjection only the parts actually occupied by their armies. Just
   before this brilliant affair Mr. Paine arrived from France, bringing with
   him two millions of livres in cash and other supplies, forming the loading
   of a brig and a ship. Mr. Paine was instrumental in procuring these
   supplies, as he was better known (from the reputation of his writings)
   than Col. Laurens who for that reason had desired his company. Whether
   these supplies were actually used to facilitate Washington's masterly
   movements we do not know, but as they were known to be coming, they gave
   the government and Washington a credit which they would" not otherwise
   have enjoyed. Money and credit are the sinews of war, and are as necessary
   to success as unanimity. Paine has the merit of contributing to both in a
   very high degree. We shall quote again from Sherwin, the most accurate of
   Mr. Paine's biographers.

   "In March, 1782, Mr. Paine published at Philadelphia the tenth number of
   the 'Crisis.' The king of England, probably with a view of keeping the
   people in good humor with the expenses of the war, had delivered a speech
   at the recent opening of parliament in which the Americans were abused,
   and the English nattered, without any regard to truth or propriety. On
   this document our author delivers his opinion in terms of the severest
   reprobation. He satirizes the pretensions of the king to the title of
   sovereign of, a free people, and draws an interesting parallel between the
   hardships of the Americans and those they would have suffered had the
   British been victorious. He concludes the number with an address to the
   people of America on the financial affairs of the states.

   In May, 1782, he published at Philadelphia the eleventh number of the
   'Crisis:' 'On the present State of News.' It had been conjectured and
   rumored, that the object of the British cabinet was to detach France from
   America, for the purpose of making a separate peace with the former, in
   order that she might be enabled to bring her whole force against the
   independence of the latter. However absurd and dishonorable such an
   attempt might appear, it would have been no more than a continuance of the
   policy which had induced the ministry to persist so long in a war where
   there was neither hope to encourage nor principle to sanction their
   conduct. The present number appears to have been written with a view to
   inform the public that such a design had been contemplated by the British
   court, and that want of means alone had prevented t it from being carried
   into execution.

   In the same month, Mr. Paine published a supernumerary 'Crisis,'
   consisting of a letter to Sir Guy Carleton. This is a most forcible appeal
   to the English general respecting the barbarous murder of Captain Huddy,
   by a refugee of the name of Lippincot. Captain Huddy, of the Jersey
   militia, with a small party of Americans, had been attacked and taken
   prisoner by an armed force in the pay of the British, and carried into New
   York. About three weeks afterward he was taken down to the water-side, put
   in a boat, and brought again upon the Jersey shore, where he was
   atrociously murdered, under the direction of the refugee before mentioned.
   General Washington, determined that such an act should not pass without
   punishment, directed that lots should be cast by the British prisoners,
   for the purpose of selecting a victim in return for the murder of Captain
   Huddy. The lot fell upon Captain Asgill; and Mr. Paine's letter to Sir Guy
   Carleton, was written with a view to induce him to give up the murderer,
   and save the life of a brave and innocent officer. It does not appear that
   this request was ever complied with; and Asgill, after suffering all the
   suspense, misery, and despair, which naturally attend such a situation,
   was at last pardoned through the humanity of the American general.

   In October, 1782, our author published, at Philadelphia, a letter to Lord
   Shelburne (afterward marquis of Lansdowne): this has since been classed as
   the twelfth number of the 'Crisis.' It is throughout an excellent
   production. The policy of concluding a peace with America, and
   acknowledging her independence, had on several occasions been discussed;
   but Lord Shelburne, unable to discover the propriety of the measure, and
   acting under the influence of that silly vanity which forms so noble an
   attribute of the freeborn Englishman, had declared that 'the sun of Great
   Britain would set whenever she acknowledged the independence of America.'
   The sentiment contained in this declaration is treated with a poignant
   satire, which must have been severely felt by the party with whom it
   originated. t

   The war was now fast drawing toward a conclusion, and America was about to
   enjoy the benefits of the liberty for which she had so long and so
   ardently contended. The British cabinet was at length convinced of the
   total impossibility of conquering the Americans; and the operations of the
   English declined in proportion as this conviction became more general. A
   definite treaty of peace was set on foot at Paris toward the end of the
   year 1782, and concluded a few months afterward. The triumphant situation
   of America-the grand and glorious effect of her courage and constancy, is
   admirably described by Mr. Paine in the last number of the ' Crisis.'' He
   congratulates the country on the happy conclusion of 'the times that tried
   men's souls,:' he dwells with pleasure on the fair character which America
   had established among the nations of the world; and observes with truth,
   that she need never be ashamed to tell her birth, or relate the stages by
   which she rose to empire. Shortly after the publication of this piece, Mr.
   Paine wrote a reply to a pamphlet by Lord Sheffield, on the subject of
   American commerce. This is classed with our author's previous productions
   as a supernumerary 'Crisis.'

   To have preserved an 'exact chronological order, we ought to have noticed
   two other pamphlets, written by him some time previous to the cessation of
   hostilities. The first of these is entitled 'Public Good;' being an
   examination of the claim of Virginia to the vacant western territory. The
   method in which the case is investigated, discovers all the acuteness and
   ability which might be expected from the author; but as the subject is not
   now a matter of interest, even to the American reader, it is not here
   necessary to enter into the discussion. There is, however, one
   circumstance connected with the performance which ought not to be omitted,
   as it serves to show the disinterested character of Mr. Paine, and his
   determination to publish his opinions unbiased and unshackled, even though
   they should militate against his own private interests. The part which our
   author espoused in the dispute was in opposition to the claim of Virginia,
   though it was well known to him at the time that a proposition was ,
   pending before the assembly of that state, for granting him a pecuniary
   compensation for his writings in favor of independence. Before the
   publication of 'Public Good,' the majority of the members were decidedly
   in" favor of the grant; but on the appearance of the pamphlet, they
   suddenly changed sides, and the motion was lost by a single vote! Such is
   the reward of ingenuous patriotism and a love of truth! With facts like
   this before us, we may cease to wonder that so many seemingly
   disinterested individuals, in every age and country, are continually drawn
   into the vortex of sycophancy and apostacy.

   In 1782, he published a letter to the Abbe Raynal. The object of this
   letter was to clear up the mistakes, and expose the errors into which the
   abbe had fallen in his history of the American revolution. Among other
   things the abbe had asserted that none of those energetic causes, which
   had produced so many revolutions upon the globe, had existed in North
   America; that neither religion nor laws had there been outraged; that the
   blood of martyrs had not streamed from scaffolds; that morals had not been
   insulted; that neither manners, customs, habits, nor any other object dear
   to nations, had there been the sport of ridicule; and that the only
   question was, whether the mother-country had or had not a right to lay a
   small tax upon the colonies. To correct and refute such misrepresentations
   as these, a reference to facts was barely necessary. They were almost too
   palpable to require a confutation; and the popular character of the abbe
   in the literary world alone accounts for their obtaining a currency. That
   such a warm and enlightened friend of humanity and freedom, as'the Abbe
   Raynal, should be mistaken in his ideas of the American revolution, is at
   first astonishing; but men who from their cradles have been surrounded by
   despotism, and who have only contemplated the blessings of liberty as a
   distant though delightful vision, are incapable of forming an opinion on
   so great an event. A long habit of beholding the acts of tyranny almost
   unfits the mind for the contemplation of any other object; and to this,
   more than to any other cause, must be attributed the mistaken conjectures
   and disordered statements of the Abbe Raynal.

   From a comparison between some of the abbe's observations and those
   contained in 'Common Sense,' on the subject of society and government, it
   appears that the abbe had borrowed very freely from the latter. Some of
   his remarks are a literal transcript, with the exception of a few words.
   Among other things which he had misstated, was the account of the affair
   at Trenton, which I have already had occasion to notice. The abbe had
   described this as a mere accidental occurrence, falling, as he says,
   'within the wide empire of chance.' This was a very unjust and ungenerous
   reflection. The highest praise was due to the American general and his
   troops, as the reader will perceive by turning to the account of the
   action; and it is to be regretted that such a distinguished writer as the
   Abbe Raynal should have been misled on the subject, for no person could
   have done it more justice.

   After exposing the abbe's errors and misrepresentation.-i. Mr. Paine
   indulges himself in a variety of philosophical reflections. The following
   description of prejudice is so replete with originality and beauty, that I
   cannot forbear quoting it:-

   'There is something exceedingly curious in the constitution and operation
   of prejudice. It has the singular ability of accommodating itself to all
   the possible varieties of the human mind. Some passions and vices are but
   thinly scattered among mankind, and find only here and there a fitness of
   reception. But prejudice, like the spider, makes everywhere its home. It
   has neither taste nor choice of place, and all that it requires is room.
   There is scarcely a situation, except fire and water, in which the spider
   will not live. So, let the mind be as naked as the walls of an empty and
   forsaken tenement, gloomy as a dungeon, or ornamented with the richest
   abilities of thinking; let it be hot, cold, dark, or light, lonely or
   inhabited, still prejudice, if undisturbed, will fill it with cobwebs, and
   live, like the spider, where there seems nothing to live on. If the one
   prepares her food by poisoning it to her palate and her use, the other
   does the same; and as several of our passions are strongly characterized
   by the animal world, prejudice may be denominated the spider of the mind.'

   The spirit of universal philanthropy which formed so conspicuous a feature
   in Mr. Paine's character, the powerful effect of his writings in favor of
   independence, and the talent which he possessed for philosophical and
   mechanical discussion, rendered, his society a valuable acquisition. Of
   his friendship with Dr. Franklin, and several other distinguished
   individuals, we have already had occasion to speak; and of the esteem in
   which his services and character were held by General Washington, we have
   several very unequivocal proofs in his conduct toward the end of the war.
   Soon after the definitive treaty of peace was concluded, the general took
   up his quarters at Rocky Hill, in the neighborhood of Princeton (where the
   congress was then sitting), for the purpose of resigning his commission.
   There he was informed that Mr.-Paine had retired to Bordentown, where he
   had a small property. Conceiving, probably, that Mr. Paine's circumstances
   were not in the most nourishing condition, he very kindly wrote to him the
   following letter:-

                                                 'Rocky HILL, Sept. 10, 17S3.

   I have learned, since I have been at this place, that you are at
   Bordentown. Whether for the sake of retirement or economy, I know not. Be
   it for either, for both, or whatever it may, if you will come to this
   place and partake with me, I shall be exceedingly happy to see you at it.

   Your presence may remind congress of your past services to this country;
   and if it is in my power to impress them, command my best exertions with
   freedom, as they will be rendered cheerfully by one who entertains a
   lively sense of the importance of your works, and who, with much pleasure,
   subscribes himself

   Your sincere friend,

                                                              G. Washington.'

   Mr. Paine was urged by several of his friends to make an application to
   congress for a compensation for his revolutionary writings; but this he
   uniformly refused to do. That the man who had been the means of first
   rousing the country to a declaration of independence, and whose writings
   had afterward very materially contributed to the attainment of the object,
   was deserving of remuneration, no one could deny; but Mr. Paine's services
   in this respect being entirely of a voluntary nature, he could not consent
   to petition the congress for a pecuniary recompense. His writings, however
   meritorious and serviceable they might have been (and the most illiberal
   of his calumniators do not deny that their effects were great and
   universal), were dictated by the pure principles of disinterested
   patriotism, and he could not degrade their character by converting them
   into a medium of sordid; emolument.

   I am well aware of the attempts which have been made to show that Mr.
   Paine's patriotism was not of that disinterested nature here described,
   and when we see that these attempts are founded upon the resolutions of
   congress itself, it is not surprising that they should have been attended
   with some success among the weaker part of mankind. A short explanation
   will, however, do away with the impressions which such reports are
   calculated to produce. Before offering any observations on the subject, we
   will first insert the resolutions as extracted from the journals of
   congress:-

   'Fridav,August 26, 1785.-On the report of a committee, consisting of Mr.
   Gerry, Mr. Petit, and Mr. King, to whom was referred a letter of the 13th
   from Thomas Paine:-

   Resolved^ That the early, unsolicited, and continued labors of Mr. Thomas
   Paine, in explaining and enforcing the principles of the late revolution,
   by ingenious and timely publications upon the nature of liberty and civil
   government, have been well received by the citizens of these states, and
   merit the approbation of congress, and that in consideration of these
   services and the benefits produced thereby, Mr. Paine is entitled to a
   liberal gratification from the United Slates.'

   'Monday, October 3, 1785.-On the report of a committee, consisting of Mr.
   Gerry, Mr. Howell, and Mr. Long, to whom were referred sundry letters from
   Mr. Thomas Paine, and a report on his letter of the 13th of September:-

   Resolved, That the board of treasury take order for paying to Mr. Thomas
   Paine the sum of three thousand dollars, for the considerations mentioned
   in the resolution of the 26th of August last.''

   That the congress granted, and that Mr. Paine received, the three thousand
   dollars above mentioned, are facts beyond dispute. The only error is in
   the wording of the two resolutions, which makes the grant appear the
   reverse of what it really was. The case was this: the salary which Mr.
   Paine received as secretary to the committee for foreign affairs was very
   small, being only eight hundred dollars a year, and the depreciation which
   took place in consequence of the immense and repeated issues of
   paper-money, reduced even this to less than a fifth of its nominal value.
   Mr. Paine, aware of the difficulties in which the congress were placed,
   forebore to harass them with any applications for money during the war,
   but after it was closed he addressed to them a letter requesting that they
   would make up the depreciation, with some other incidental expenses which
   he had been at in the discharge of his official duties. The letter was
   referred to a committee, of which Mr. Gerry was chairman. This gentlemen
   came to Mr. Paine and informed him that 'the committee had consulted upon
   the subject, that they intended to bring in a handsome report, but they
   thought it best not to take any notice of Deane's affair or Mr. Paine's
   salary.'-' They will indemnify you,' said he, 'without it. The case is,
   there are some motions on the journals of congress for censuring you with
   respect to Deane'.* affair, which cannot now be recalled, because they
   have been printed. We will, therefore, bring in a report that will
   supersede them, without mentioning the purport-of your letter.'

   The grant was therefore an indemnity to Mr. Paine for the depreciation in
   his salary as secretary of the committee, and the reason for couching it
   in the terms above quoted, was to shield the congress from a confession of
   the injustice they had done our author for his conduct during the disputes
   about the claims of Silas Deane. It was no more than he had a right to
   expect, and those who granted it had not much reason to boast of their
   liberality, in performing what was merely  o  an act of pecuniary justice.
   So much for the grant of three thousand dollars, the false language in
   which it is clothed, and the malevolent insinuations which it has given
   rise to.

   But though Mr. Paine had resolved not to make any application to the
   congress on the score of his literary labors, he had several friends in
   the provincial assemblies who were determined that his exertions should
   not pass unrewarded. I have already spoken of the proposition that was
   made to the assembly of Virginia for this purpose, and the cause of its
   failure. Similar motions were brought before the legislature of
   Pennsylvania and the assembly of New York; the former of which gave him
   -L-500, and the latter the confiscated estate of a Mr. Frederick Devoe, a
   royalist. This estate, situated at New Rochelle, consisting of more than
   three hundred acres of land in a high state of cultivation, with a
   spacious and elegant stone-house, beside extensive out-buildings, was a
   valuable acquisition; and the readiness with which it was granted, is a
   proof of the high estimation in which Mr. Paine's services were held by
   one of the most opulent and powerful states in the Union.

   In 1786, he published at Philadelphia, his 'Dissertations on Government,'
   'The Affairs of the Bank,' and 'Paper-Money.' The bank alluded to was the
   one which had been established some years before, under the name of the
   'Bank of North America.' Whatever opinion may be entertained of these
   institutions in general, it is evident that the one in question had been
   'of considerable service to the Americans during the most eventful period
   of their struggle for independence; to say the least, it was therefore
   entitled.to their gratitude. But when men find themselves in a state of
   ease and security, they are too apt to forget the means by which they
   obtained these advantages; and the bank, without any regard to its past
   services, was attacked as an establishment at variance with every
   principle of private security and public freedom. In the pamphlet before
   us Mr. Paine gives an elaborate and interesting account of the rise and
   progress of the institution; and as he was one of the first promoters of
   the scheme, a short account of it here will not be altogether unnecessary,
   although it will involve some repetition.

   The beginning of the year 1780 was a very distressing season for the
   Americans. The people, though not conquered, were depressed; the soldiers,
   though not driven from the field, were destitute of resources, and such
   was their condition, that General Washington .was, for a considerable
   time, in the daily dread of a general mutiny. In this state of affairs he
   addressed a letter to the Pennsylvania assembly, describing in the
   strongest terms the nature of his situation. At that period Mr. Paine was
   clerk of the assembly, and, as a part of his duty, he was requested to
   read the letter. When this was done, he informs us, a despairing silence
   pervaded the house.' No one ventured to speak for a considerable time. At
   length one of the members arose and said: 'If the account in that letter
   is a true state of things, and we are in the situation there represented,
   it appears to me in vain to contend the matter any longer. We may as well
   give up at first as at last.' Another of the members, more cheerful than
   the last, rose and expressed his hope that the house would not be overcome
   by despair; that the only way to get over the difficulty was by exertion;
   and a motion for adjournment being, made, the assembly separated without
   coming to any conclusion.

   America was, indeed, at this period, in a most critical situation. .There
   now appeared no chance of retrieving her affairs by taxation, for the
   people were already overburdened, and the only mode that presented itself
   was that of a voluntary subscription. There was no time to be lost; and,
   as a beginning. Mr. Paine, immediately on his return from the house, drew
   the salary due to him as clerk of the assembly, and enclosed five hundred
   dollars in a letter to Mr. M'Clenaghan, proposing to him to commence a
   subscription, as the only means of alleviating the wants of the army. This
   gentleman showed the proposal to several others who fully approved of it:
   a subscription was commenced and after being attended with considerable
   success, the subscribers formed themselves into a bank, which soon
   answered all the purposes for which it was intended. In 1782, the
   subscribers were legally incorporated under the title of the 'Bank of
   North America,' which they held, with advantage to the public.'

   Mr. Paine is clear in his opinion on paper-money: but he regards this bank
   as one of necessity in its origin, and of great service to the country
   during the latter part of the war, when the irredeemable notes issued by
   the government had lost their value by depreciation. Mr. Paine could, not
   forget the services of the bank; and hence he defended it efficiently
   against this attack, which he considered rude and unnecessary: yet he
   explicitly condemns the charter, which was made perpetual. This was the
   last public act of Mr. Paine previous to his departure for Europe.

   Thus we arrive at the conclusion of the second period of Mt. Paine's life.
   At this time he enjoyed the highest popularity, and, as we" have seen, the
   friendship of the most enlightened patriots of the age. Mr. Paine was as
   much esteemed in his private life as in his public. He was a welcome
   visitor to the tables of the most distinguished citizens: his manners and
   habits were those of a gentleman, which rendered him agreeable, not only
   to the master of the family, but to the mistress also. He was full of
   anecdote, extremely social, and always mixed good nature with his
   reflections. At a later period, in prospect of a dinner-party, Horne Tooke
   remarked, that "he would venture to say that the best thing would be said
   by Mr. Paine." Indeed, his conversational powers were as distinguished as
   his tact for writing. An old lady, now a boardinghouse-keeper in Cedar
   street, remembers, when a girl, visiting Mr. Paine just after the war,
   when he took possession of his house and farm at New Rochelle, and gave a
   village-fete on the occasion; she then only knew him as "Common Sense,"
   and supposed that was his name. On that day he had something to say to
   everybody, and young as she was she received a portion of his attention;
   while he sat in the shade and assisted in the labor of the feast, by
   cutting or breaking sugar to be used in some agreeable liquids by his
   guests. Mr. Paine was then, if not handsome, a fine, agreeable looking
   man.

   Those disposed to censure Mr. Paine, find a subject in the affair of
   Deane: they say nothing can excuse his betrayal of the public secrets of
   office, even though it was for the benefit of the people, to resist an
   unjust claim on the public, and to expose a public robber. In this affair
   we must, however, remember, that when France wished the secret kept she
   was not at war with England; but that when Paine made the exposure France
   was at open war with England. Still, we are not disposed to defend the
   act; while we acquit him of every moral impropriety. We think, with
   Sterne, in the case of Corporal Trim, who had disobeyed orders in the
   performance of an act of humanity, when he makes Uncle Toby say, "You did
   very right as a man, but very wrong as a soldier." Mr. Paine was placed in
   a position where he had the choice of two evils: in his choice he
   sacrificed himself for the benefit of the country. A man, less generous,
   would have taken care of himself at all hazards.

                                   PART III.

   FROM MR. PAINE.'S DEPARTURE FROM AMERICA IN 1787 TO HIS FINAL RETURN IN
   1802, EMBRACING THE PERIOD OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND DURATION OF THE
   FRENCH REPUBLIC.

   "We are now," says Sherwin, "to follow Mr. Paine to a different scene from
   that in which he had been a prominent performer for nearly thirteen years.
   His desire of attacking the English government on the spot where its
   principles were still in full operation, had suffered no change or
   abatement, and as America no longer stood in need of his services, he
   resolved on putting his project into execution as soon as possible. In
   April, 1787, he set sail from the United States for France, and arrived in
   Paris after a short passage. His knowledge of mechanics and natural
   philosophy had before his departure procured him the honor of being
   admitted a member of the American Philosophical society; he was likewise
   appointed master of arts by the university of Philadelphia. These academic
   honors, though not of much consequence in themselves, were the means of
   introducing him to several of the most scientific men in France, and soon
   after his arrival he exhibited to the Academy of Sciences in Paris, the
   model of an iron bridge which had occupied much of his leisure time during
   his residence in America, This ingenious and useful production received
   the most unqualified approbation of the academy, and it is but justice to
   Mr. Paine to observe, that his recommendations on this subject have been
   sanctioned and adopted by some of the most enlightened characters of the
   present age. Among those who have given their opinion on the subject, we
   ought to notice Sir Joseph Banks, who, in a letter to a friend in America,
   published some years ago, says: 'I expect many similar improvements from
   your countrymen, who think with vigor, and are in a great measure free
   from those shackles of theory which are impressed on the minds of our
   people, even before they are capable of exerting their mental faculties to
   advantage.'

   From Paris Mr. Paine proceeded to London, where he arrived on the third of
   September. Before the end of that month he went to Thetford to see his
   mother, who by this time was borne down by age and penury. His father, it-
   appears, had died during his absence; and he hastened to the place of his
   birth to relive the wants of his surviving parent. He led recluse sort of
   life at Thetford for several weeks, being principally occupied in writing
   a pamphlet on the state of the nation, under the title of Prospects on the
   Rubicon.' This was published in London, toward the end of the year 1787.
   The purport, of the work is an investigation of the causes and
   consequences of the politics expected to be agitated at the approaching
   meeting of parliament. A great variety of subjects are introduced, not
   only on government in general, but on what is usually termed political
   economy. The principal portion of it is occupied with a discussion on the
   then unsettled state of the affairs of Holland, and a comparison between
   the population, revenues, wealth, and general condition of France and
   England. The French revolution was at this period beginning to bud forth,
   a spirit of inquiry was diffusing itself over the land, while in England
   the people were sunk into a state of torpid lethargy. 'The people of
   France,' Mr. Paine observes, were beginning to think for themselves, and
   the people of England were resigning up the prerogative of thinking.'

   During the year 1788, Mr. Paine was principally occupied in building his
   bridge. For this purpose he went to Rotherham in Yorkshire, in order^ that
   he might have an opportunity of superintending the castings of iron, which
   were executed under the direction of his ingenious friend, Mr. Walker, the
   proprietor of the foundry at that place. For a copious account of the
   success which attended this project, the reader is referred to the
   author's letter to Sir George Staunton. This gentleman, who it appears
   possessed talent enough to appreciate the value of the performance, sent
   the letter to the Society of Arts, &c., in the Adelphi: its contents were
   deservedly regarded by the members of the society as a subject worthy of
   their notice, and it was unanimously determined that the letter should be
   published in their 'Transactions;' but the moment the first part of
   'Rights of Man' made its appearance, this determination was reversed, and
   the votaries and advocates of science became the voluntary tools of
   despotism. How thoroughly despicable must the minds of those men be, who
   could be gratified by such an act of pitiful meanness!

   Mr. Paine had been at considerable expense in the erection of his bridge,
   which was principally defrayed by a Mr. Whiteside, an American merchant.
   Of our author's connexions with this gentleman I have not been able to
   obtain any particulars which may be relied upon; but the probability is,
   that Mr. Paine had consigned over to him some of his property in America,
   and on the strength of this consideration had drawn upon him for money
   whenever he had wanted it. Be this as it may, it is certain he had
   overdrawn his account to a considerable extent, and Whiteside becoming a
   bankrupt soon afterward, the assignees arrested him for the balance. From
   this disagreeable situation he was in a short time released by the
   kindness of two American merchants, who agreed to become his bail, Mr.
   Paine paying down a considerable portion of the money, which by this time
   he had received from America, and giving his promissory note for the
   remainder.

   The situation of France was by this period become a matter of great
   interest to all Europe, and as Mr. Paine was in confidential intercourse
   with the chief authors of the great scenes which were taking place, he
   hastened over to Paris, that he might have the pleasure of witnessing the
   downfall of Bourbon despotism."

   Mr. Paine's disinterested exertions in the cause both of French and
   English liberty can best be understood by taking a clear view of the
   French revolution; and as Mr. Paine has himself given us the best concise
   history of that event, we shall offer no apology for its introduction
   here. Our extract is taken from the " Rights of Man," a work which we must
   presently introduce as the principal political publication of Mr. Paine.
   In this work he quotes an expression of Mr. Burke, that, "All
   circumstances taken together, the French revolution is the most
   astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world." Mr. Paine then
   remarks:-

   "As wise men are astonished at foolish things, and other people at wise
   ones, I know not on which ground to account for Mr. Burke's astonishment;
   but certain it is that he does not understand the French revolution. It
   has apparently burst forth like a creation from a chaos, but it is no more
   than the consequence of mental revolution previously existing in France.
   The mind of the nation had changed beforehand and a new order of things
   has naturally followed a new order of thoughts. I will here, as concisely
   as I can, trace out the growth of the French revolution, and mark the
   circumstances that have contributed to produce it.

   The despotism of Louis-XIV. united with the gayety of his court, and the
   gaudy ostentation of his character, had so humbled, and at the same time
   so fascinated the mind of France, that the people appear to have lost all
   sense of their own dignity, in contemplating that of their grand monarch:
   and the whole reign of Louis XV., remarkable only for weakness and
   effeminacy, made no other alteration than that of spreading a sort of
   lethargy over the nation, from which it showed no disposition to rise.

   The only signs which appeared of the spirit of liberty during those
   periods, are to be found in the writings of the French philosophers.
   Montesquieu, president of the parliament of Bourdeaux, went as far as a
   writer under a despotic government could well proceed: and being obliged
   to divide himself between principle and prudence, his mind often appears
   under a veil, and we ought to give him credit for more than he has
   expressed.

   Voltaire, who was both the flatterer and satirist of despotism, took
   another line. His forte lay in exposing and ridiculing the superstitions
   which priestcraft, united with statecraft, had interwoven with
   governments. It was not from the purity of his principles, or his love of
   mankind {for satire and philanthropy are not naturally concordant), but
   from his strong capacity of seeing folly in its true shape, and his
   irresistible propensity to expose it, that he made those attacks. They
   were, however, as formidable as if the motives had been virtuous; and he
   merits the thanks rather than the esteem of mankind.

   On the contrary, we find in the writings of Rousseau and Abbe Raynal, a
   loveliness of sentiment in favor of liberty, that excites respect, and
   elevates the human faculties; yet having raised this animation, they do
   not direct its operations, but leave the mind in love with an object,
   without describing the means of possessing it.

   The writings of Quisne, Turgot, and the friends of those authors, are of
   ,a serious kind; but they labored under the same disadvantage with
   Montesquieu; their writings abound with moral maxims of government, but
   are rather directed to economize and reform the administration of the
   government, than the government itself.'

   But all those writings and many others had their weight; and by the
   different manner in which they treated the subject of
   government-Montesquieu by his judgment and knowledge of laws, Voltaire by
   his wit, Rousseau and Raynal by their animation, and Quisne and Turgot by
   their moral maxims and systems of economy-readers of every class met with
   something to their taste, and a spirit of political inquiry began to
   diffuse itself through the nation at the time the dispute between England
   and the then colonies of America broke out.

   In the war which France afterward engaged in, it is very well known that
   the nation appeared to be beforehand with the French ministry. Each of
   them had its views; but those views were directed to different objects;
   the one sought liberty and the other retaliation on England. The French
   officers and soldiers who after this went to America, were eventually
   placed in the school of freedom, and learned the practice as well as the
   principles of it by heart.

   As it was impossible to separate the military events which took place in
   America from the principles of the American revolution, the publication of
   those events in France necessarily connected themselves with the
   principles that produced them. Many of the facts were in themselves
   principles; such as the declaration of American independence, and the
   treaty of alliance between France and America, which recognised the
   natural rights of man, and justified resistance to oppression.

   The then minister of France, Count Vergennes, was not the friend of
   America; and it is both justice and gratitude to say that it was the queen
   of France who gave the cause of America a fashion at the French court.
   Count Vergennes was the personal and social friend of Dr. Franklin; and
   the doctor had obtained, by his sensible gracefulness, a sort of influence
   over him; but with respect to principles, Count Vergennes was a despot.

   The situation of Dr. Franklin as minister from America to France should be
   taken into the chain of circumstances. A diplomatic character is the
   narrowest sphere of society that man can act in. It forbids intercourse by
   a reciprocity of suspicion; and a diplomatist is a sort of unconnected
   atom, continually repelling and repelled. But this was not the case with
   Dr. Franklin; he was not the diplomatist of a court, but of man. His
   character as a philosopher had been long established, and his circle of
   society in France was universal.

   Count Vergennes resisted for a considerable time the publication of the
   American constitutions in France, translated into the French language; but
   even in this he was obliged to give way to public opinion, and a sort of
   propriety in admitting to appear what he had undertaken to defend. The
   American constitutions were to liberty what a grammar is to language: they
   define its parts of speech, and practically construct them into syntax.

   The peculiar situation of the then Marquis de la Fayette is another link
   in the great chain. He served in America as an American officer, under a
   commission of congress, and by the universality of his acquaintance, was
   in close friendship with the civil government of America as well as with
   the military line. He spoke the language of the country, entered into the
   discussions on the principles of government, and was always a welcome
   friend at any election.

   When the war closed, a vast reinforcement to the cause of liberty spread
   itself over France, by the return of the French officers and soldiers. A
   knowledge of the practice was then joined to the theory; and all that was
   wanting to give it real existence, was opportunity. Man cannot, properly
   speaking, make circumstances for his purpose, but he always has it in his
   power to improve them when they occur: and this was the case in France.

   M. Neckar was displaced in May, 1781; and by the ill management of the
   finances afterward, and particularly during the extravagant administration
   of M. Calonne, the revenue of France, which was nearly twenty-four
   millions sterling per year, was become Unequal to the expenditures, not
   because the revenue had decreased, but because the expenses had increased,
   and this was the circumstance which the nation laid hold of to bring
   forward a revolution. The English minister, Mr. Pitt, has frequently
   alluded to the state of the French finances in his budgets, without
   understanding the subject. Had the French parliaments been as ready to
   register edicts for new taxes, as an English parliament is to grant them,
   there had been no derangement in the finances, nor yet any revolution; but
   this will better explain itself as I proceed.

   It will be necessary here to show how taxes were formerly raised in
   France. The king, or rather the court or ministry, acting under the use of
   that name, framed the edicts for taxes at thejr own-discretion, and sent
   them to the parliaments to be registered; for, until they were registered
   by the parliaments, they were not operative. Disputes had long existed
   between the court and the parliament with respect to the extent of, the
   parliament's authority on this head. The court insisted that the authority
   of parliament went no farther than to remonstrate or show reasons against
   the tax, reserving to itself the right of determining whether the reasons
   were well or ill founded; and in consequence thereof, either to withdraw
   the edict as a matter of choice, or to order it to be registered as a
   matter of authority. The parliaments on their parts insisted, that they
   had not only a right to remonstrate, but to reject; and on this ground
   they we're always supported by the nation.

   But to return to the order of my narrative: M. Calonne wanted money; and
   as he knew the sturdy ,disposition of the parliaments with respect to new
   taxes, he ingeniously sought either to approach them by a more gentle
   means than that of direct authority, or to get over their heads by a
   manoevre; and for this purpose he revived the project of assembling a body
   of men from the several provinces, under the style of an 'assembly of the
   notables,' or men of note, who met in 1787, and were either to recommend
   taxes to the parliaments or to act as a parliament themselves. An assembly
   under this name had been called in 1687.

   As we are to view this as the first practical step toward the revolution,
   it will be proper to enter into some particulars respecting it. The
   assembly of the notables has in some places been mistaken for the
   states-general, but was wholly a different body; the states-general being
   always by election. The persons who composed the assembly of the notables
   were all nominated by the king, and consisted of one hundred and forty
   members. But as M. Calonne could not depend upon a majority of this
   assembly in his favor, he very ingeniously arranged them in such a manner
   as to make forty-four a majority of one hundred and forty. To effect this,
   he disposed of them into seven separate committees of twenty members each.
   Every general question was to be decided, not by a majority of persons,
   but by a majority of committees; and, as eleven votes would make a
   majority in a committee, and four committees a majority of seven, M.
   Calonne had, good reason to conclude, that as forty-four would determine
   any general question, he could not be outvoted. But all his plans deceived
   him, and in the event became his overthrow.

   The then Marquis de la Fayette was placed in the second committee, of
   which Count d'Artois was president; and as money matters was the object,
   it naturally brought into view every circumstance connected with it.' M.
   de la Fayette made a verbal charge against Calonne, for selling crown-land
   to the amount of two millions of livres, in a manner that appeared to be
   unknown to the king. The Count d'Artois (as if to intimidate, for the
   bastile was then in being) asked the marquis if he would render the charge
   in writing. He replied that he would. The Count d'Artois did not demand
   it, but brought a message from the king to that purport. M. de la Fayette
   then delivered in his charge in writing, to be given to the king,
   undertaking to support it. No farther proceedings were had, upon this
   affair but M. Calonne was soon after dismissed by the king, and went to
   England.

   As M de la Fayette, from the experience he had had in America, was better
   acquainted with the science of civil government than the generality of the
   members who composed the assembly of the notables could then be, the brunt
   of the business fell considerably to his share. The plan of those who had
   a constitution in view was to contend with the court on the ground of
   taxes, and some of them openly professed their object. Disputes frequently
   arose between Count d'Artois and M. de la Fayette upon various subjects.
   With respect to the arrears already incurred, the latter proposed to
   remedy them, by accommodating the expenses to the revenue, instead of the
   revenue to the expenses.; and as objects of reform, he proposed to abolish
   the bastile, and all the state-prisons throughout the nation (the keeping
   of which was attended with great expense) and to suppress leilres de
   cachet; but those matters were not then much attended to; and with respect
   to lettres de cachet, a majority of the nobles appeared to be in favor of
   them.

   On the subject of supplying the treasury by new taxes, the assembly
   declined taking the matter on themselves, concurring in the opinion that
   they had not authority. In a debate on the subject, M. de la Fayette said,
   that raising money by taxes could only be done by a national assembly,
   freely elected by the people, and acting as their representatives. 'Do you
   mean,' said the Count d'Artois, ' the states-general M. de la Fayette
   replied that he did. 'Will you,' said the Count d'Artois, ' sign what you
   say, to be given to the king?' The other replied that he not only would do
   this, but 'that he would go farther, and say, that the effectual mode
   would' be, for the king to agree to the establishment of a constitution.

   As one of the plans had thus failed, that of getting the assembly to act
   as a parliament, the other came ir\\to view, that of recommending. On this
   subject, the assembly agreed to recommend two new taxes to be enregistered
   by the parliament, the one a stamp-act, and the other a territorial tax,
   or sort of land tax. The two have been estimated at about five millions
   sterling per annum. We have now to turn our attention to the parliaments,
   on whom the business was again devolving.

   The archbishop of Thoulouse (since archbishop of Sens, and now a cardinal)
   was appointed to the administration of the finances, soon after the
   dismission of Calonne. He was also made prime minister, an officer that
   did not always exist in France. When this office did not exist, the chief
   of each of the principal departments transacted business immediately with
   the king; but when a prime minister was appointed, they did business only
   with him. The archbishop arrived to more state authority than any minister
   since the Duke de Choiseuil, and the nation was strongly disposed in his
   favor; but by a line of conduct scarcely to be accounted for, he perverted
   every opportunity, turned out a despot, and sunk into disgrace, and a
   cardinal.

   The assembly of the notables having broke up, the new minister sent the
   edicts for the two new taxes recommended by the assembly to the
   parliaments, to be enregistered They of course came first before the
   parliament of Paris, who returned for answer, that, with such a revenue as
   the nation then supported, the name of taxes ought not to be mentioned,
   but for the purpose of reducing them, and threw both the edicts out.

   On this refusal, the parliament was ordered to Versailles, where, in the
   usual form, the king held, what under the old government was called a bed
   of justice: and the two edicts were enregistered in presence of the
   parliament, by an order of state. On this, the parliament immediately
   returned to Paris, renewed their session in form, and ordered the
   enregistering to he struck out, declaring that everything done at
   Versailles was illegal. All the members of parliament were then served
   with lettres de cachet, and exiled to Trois; -but as they continued as
   inflexible in exile as before, and as vengeance did  o  not supply the
   place of taxes, they were after a short time recalled, to Paris.

   The edicts were again tendered to them, and the Count d'Artois undertook
   to act as representative for the king. For this purpose, he came from
   Versailles to Paris, in a train of procession; and the parliament was
   assembled to receive him. But show and parade had lost their influence in
   France; and whatever ideas of importance he might set off with, he had to
   return with those of mortification and disappointment. On alighting from
   his carriage to ascend the steps of the parliament-house, the crowd (which
   was numerously collected) threw out trite expressions, saying: 'This is
   Monsieur d'Artois, who wants more of -our money to spend.' The marked'
   disapprobation which he saw, impressed him with apprehensions; and the
   word aux arms (to arms) was given out by the officer of the guard who
   attended him. It was so loudly vociferated, I hat it echoed through the
   avenues of the house, and produced a temporary confusion: I was then
   standing in one of the apartments through which he had to pass, and could
   not avoid reflecting how wretched is the condition of a disrespected man.

   He endeavored to impress the parliament by great words, and opened his
   authority by saying: 'The king our lord and\\ master.' The parliament
   received him very coolly, and with their usual determination not to
   register the taxes; and in this manner the interview ended.

   After this a new subject took place; in the various debates and contests
   that arose between the court and the parliaments on the subject of taxes,
   the parliament of Paris at last declared, that although it had been
   customary for parliaments to enregister edicts for taxes as a matter of
   convenience, the right belonged only to the states-general; and that,
   therefore, the parliaments could no longer with propriety continue to
   debate on what it had not authority to act. The king, after this, came to
   Paris, and held a meeting with the parliament, in which he continued from
   ten in the morning till about six in the evening; and, in a manner that
   appeared to proceed from him, as if unconsulted upon with the cabinet or
   ministry, gave 1iis word to the parliament that the states-general should
   be convened.

   But after this, another scene arose, on a ground different from all the
   former. The minister and the cabinet were averse to calling the
   stages-general: they well knew, that if the states-general were assembled,
   that themselves must fall j and as the king had not mentioned any lime,
   they hit on a project calculated to elude, without appearing to oppose. .

   For this purpose, the court set about making a sort of constitution
   itself: it was principally the work of M. Lamoignon, keeper of the seals,
   who afterward shot himself. The arrangement consisted in establishing a
   body under the name of a cour pleniere, or full court, in which were
   invested all the power that the government might have occasion to make use
   of. The persons composing this court to be nominated by the king; the
   contended right of taxation was given up on the part of the king, and a
   new criminal code of laws, and law proceedings, was substituted in the
   room of the former. The thing, in many points, contained better principles
   than those upon which the government had hitherto been administered; but,
   with respect to the cour pleniere, it was no other than a medium, through
   which despotism was to pass, without appearing to act directly from
   itself.

   The cabinet had high expectations from their new contrivance. The persons
   who were to compose the cour pleniere were already nominated; and as it
   was necessary to carry a fair appearance, many of the best characters in
   the nation were appointed among the number. It was to commence on the
   eighth of May, 1788: but an opposition arose to it, on two grounds-the one
   as to principle, the other as to form.

   On the ground of principle it was contended, that government had not a
   right to alter itself; and that if the practice was once admitted, it
   would grow into a principle, and be' made a precedent for any future
   alterations the government might wish to establish; that the right of
   altering the government was a national right, and not a right of
   government. And on the ground of form, it was contended that the Cour
   pleniere was nothing more than a large cabinet.

   The then Dukes de laRochefoucault, Luxembourg, de Noailles, and many
   others, refused to accept the nomination, and strenuously opposed the
   whole plan. When the edict for establishing this new court was sent to the
   parliaments to be enregistered, and put into execution, they resisted
   also. The parliament of Paris not only refused, but denied the authority;
   and the contest renewed itself between the parliament and the cabinet more
   strongly than ever. While the parliament was sitting in debate on this
   subject, the ministry ordered a regiment of soldiers to surround the
   house, and form a blockade. The members sent out for beds and provision,
   and lived as in a besieged citadel; and as this had no effect, the
   commanding officer was ordered to enter the parliament-house and seize
   them, which he did, and some of the principal members were shut up in
   different prisons. About the same time a deputation of persons arrived
   from the province of Britanny, to remonstrate against the establishment of
   the cour pleniere, and those the archbishop sent to the bastile. But the
   spirit of the nation was not to be overcome; and it was so fully sensible
   of the strong ground it had taken, that of withholding taxes, that it
   contented itself with keeping up a sort of quiet resistance, which
   effectually overthrew all the plans at that time formed against it. The
   project of the cour p/eniere was at last obliged to be given up, and the
   prime minister not long afterward followed its fate: and M. Neckar was
   recalled into office.

   The attempt to establish the cour pleniere had, an effect upon the nation
   which was not anticipated. It was a sort of new form of government, that
   insensibly served to put the old one out of sight, and to unhinge it from
   the superstitious authority of .antiquity. It was government dethroning
   government; and the old one, by attempting to make a new one, made a
   chasm.

   The failure of this scheme renewed the subject of convening the
   states-general; and this gave rise to a new series of politics. There was
   no settled form for convening the states general: all that it- positively
   meant was a deputation from what was then called the clergy, the nobility,
   and the commons; but their numbers; or their proportions, had not always
   been the same. They had been convened only on extraordinary occasions, the
   last of which was in 1614; their numbers were then in equal proportions,
   and they voted by orders.

   It could not well escape the sagacity of M. Neckar,' that the mode of 1614
   would answer neither the purpose of the then government, nor of the
   nation. As matters were at that time circumstanced, it would have been too
   contentious to argue upon anything. The debates would have been endless
   upon privileges and exemptions, in which neither the wants of the
   government, nor the wishes of the nation for a constitution, would have
   been attended to. But as he did not choose to take the decision upon
   himself, he summoned again the 'assembly of (he notables, and referred it
   to them. This body was in general interested in the decision', being
   chiefly of the aristocracy and the high-paid clergy; and they decided in
   favor of the mode of 1614. This decision was against the sense of the
   nation, and also against the wishes of the court; for the aristocracy
   opposed itself to both, and contended for privileges independent of
   either. The .subject was then taken up by the parliament, who recommended
   that the number of the commons should be equal to the other two; and that
   they should all sit in one house and vote in one body. The number finally
   determined on was twelve hundred: six hundred were to be chosen by the
   commons (and this was less than their proportion ought to have been when
   their worth and consequence are considered on a national scale), three
   hundred by the clergy, and three hundred by the aristocracy; but with
   respect to the mode of assembling themselves, whether together or apart,
   or the manner in which they should vote, those matters were referred.

   The election that followed was not a contested election, but an animated
   one. The candidates were not men but principles. Societies were formed in
   Paris, and committees of correspondence and communication established
   throughout the nation, for the purpose of enlightening' the people, and
   explaining to them the principles of civil government; and so orderly was
   the election conducted, that it did not give rise even to the rumor of
   tumult.

   The states-general were to meet at Versailles in April, 1789, but did not
   assemble till May. They situated themselves in three separate chambers, or
   rather the clergy and the aristocracy withdrew each into a separate
   chamber. The majority of the aristocracy claimed what they called the
   privilege of voting as a separate body, and of giving their consent or
   their negative in that manner; and many of the bishops and the
   high-beneficed clergy claimed the same privilege on the part of their
   order.

   The tiers etat (as they were called) disowned any knowledge of artificial
   orders and artificial privileges; and they were not only resolute on this
   point, but somewhat disdainful. They began to consider aristocracy as a
   kind of fungus growing out of the corruption of society, that could not be
   admitted even as a branch of it; and from the disposition the aristocracy
   had shown, by upholding lettres de cachet, and in sundry other instances,
   it was manifest that no constitution could be formed by admitting men in
   any other character than as national men.

   After various altercations on this head, the tiers etat, or commons (as
   they were then called), declared themselves (on a motion made for that
   purpose by the Abbe Sieyes) 'the Representatives Of The Nation; and that
   the two orders could be considered but as deputies of corporations, and
   could only have a deliberative voice but when they assembled in a
   national  character with (he national representatives.'' This proceeding
   extinguished the style of etats generaux, or states-general, and erected
   it into the style it now bears, that of l'assemble nationale, or national
   assembly.

   This motion was not made in a precipitate manner: it was the result of
   cool deliberation, and concerted between the national representatives and
   the patriotic members of the two, chambers, who saw into the folly,
   mischief, and injustice of artificial privileged distinctions. It was
   become evident that no constitution, worthy of being called by that name,
   could be established on anything less than a national ground. The
   aristocracy had hitherto opposed the despotism of the court, and affected
   the language of patriotism; but it opposed it as its rival (as the English
   barons opposed King John); and it now opposed the nation from the same
   motives.

   On carrying this motion the national representatives, as had been
   concerted, sent an invitation to the two chambers, to unite with them in
   a, national character, and proceed to business. A majority of the clergy,
   chiefly of the parish priests, withdrew from the clerical chamber and
   joined the nation; and forty-five from the other chamber joined in like
   manner. There is a sort of secret history belonging to this last
   circumstance, which is necessary to its explanation: it was not judged
   prudent that all the patriotic members of the chamber, styling itself the
   nobles, should quit it at once; and in consequence of this arrangement,
   they drew off by degrees^ always leaving some, as well to reason the case,
   as to watch the suspected. In a little time the numbers increased from
   forty-five to eighty, and soon after to a greater number; which, with a
   majority of the clergy, and the whole of the national representatives, put
   the malcontents in a very diminutive condition.

   The king, who, very different to the general class called by that name, is
   a man of a good heart, showed himself disposed to recommend a union of the
   three chambers, on the ground the national assembly had taken; but the
   malcontents exerted themselves to prevent it, find began now to have
   another project in view. Their numbers consisted of a majority of the
   aristocratical chamber, and a minority of the clerical chamber, chiefly of
   bishops and high-beneficed clergy; and these men were determined to put
   everything to issue, as well by strength as by stratagem. They had no
   objection to a constitution; but it must be such a one as themselves
   should dictate, and suited to their own views and particular situations.
   On the other hand, the nation disowned knowing anything of them but as
   citizens, and was determined to shut out all such upstart pretensions. The
   more aristocracy appeared, the more it was despised; there was a visible
   imbecility and want of intellect in the majority, a sort of je ne sais
   quoi, that while 1t affected to be more than citizen was less than man. It
   lost ground more from contempt than from hatred; and was rather jeered at
   as an ass than dreaded as a lion. This is the general character of
   aristocracy, or what are called nobles-or nobility, or rather no-ability,
   in all countries.

   The plan of the malcontents consisted now of two things; either to
   deliberate and vote by chambers (or orders), more especially on all
   questions respecting a constitution (by which the aristocratical chamber
   would have had a negative on any article of the constitution), or, in case
   they could not accomplish this object, to overthrow the national assembly
   entirely.

   To effect one or the other of these objects, they began now to cultivate a
   friendship with the despotism they had hitherto attempted to rival, and
   the Count d'Artois became their chief. The king (who has since declared
   himself deceived into their measures) held, according to the old form, a
   bed of justice, in which he accorded to the deliberation and vote par tete
   (by head) upon several objects; but reserved the deliberation and vote,
   upon all questions respecting a constitution, to the three chambers
   separately. This declaration of the king was made against the advice of M.
   Neckar, who now began to perceive that he was growing out of fashion at
   court, and that, another minister was in contemplation.

   As the form of sitting in separate chambers was yet apparently kept up,
   though essentially destroyed, .the national representatives, immediately
   after this declaration of the king, resorted to their own chambers to
   consult on a protest against it; and the minority of the chamber (calling
   itself the nobles) who had joined the national cause, retired to a private
   house to consult in like manner. The malcontents had by this time
   concerted their measures with the court, which count d'Artois undertook to
   conduct: and as they saw, from the discontent which the declaration
   excited, and the opposition making against it, that they could not obtain
   a control over the intended constitution by a separate vote, they prepared
   themselves for their final object; that of conspiring against the national
   assembly and overthrowing it.

   The next morning the door of the chamber of the national assembly was shut
   against them, and guarded by troops, and the members were refused
   admittance. On this they withdrew to a tennis-ground, in the neighborhood
   of Versailles, as the most convenient place they could find; and, after
   renewing their session, took an oath never to separate from each other
   under any circumstances whatever, death excepted, until they had
   established a constitution. As the experiment of shutting up the house had
   no other effect than that of producing a closer connexion in the members,
   it was opened again the next day, and the public business recommenced in
   the usual place. .

   We are now to have in view the forming of the new ministry, which was to
   accomplish the overthrow of the national assembly. But as force would be
   necessary, orders were issued to assemble thirty thousand troops, the
   command of which was given to Broglio, one of the new-intended ministry,
   who was recalled from the country for this purpose. But as some management
   was necessary to keep this plan concealed till the moment it should be
   ready for execution, it is to this policy that a declaration made by Count
   d'Artois must be attributed, and which is here proper to be introduced.

   It could not but occur that while the malcontents continued to resort to
   their chambers separate from the national assembly, that more jealousy
   would be excited than if they were mixed with it, and that the plot might
   be suspected: but as they had taken their ground, and now wanted a
   pretence for quitting it, it was necessary that one should be devised.
   This was effectually accomplished by a declaration made by Count d'Artois,
   that ' if they took not a part in the national assembly, the life of the
   king would be endangered' on which they quitted their chambers and mixed
   with the assembly in one body.

   At the time this declaration was made, it was generally treated as a piece
   of absurdity in Count d'Artois, and calculated merely to relieve the
   outstanding members of the two chambers from the diminutive situation they
   were put in; and if nothing more had followed this conclusion would have
   been good. .But as things best explain themselves by their events, this
   apparent union was only a cover to the machinations that were secretly
   going on; and the declaration accommodated itself to answer that purpose.
   In a little time the national assembly found itself surrounded by troops,
   and thousands daily arriving. On this a very strong declaration was made
   by the national assembly to the king, remonstrating on the impropriety of
   the measure, and demanding the reason. The king, who was not in the secret
   of this business, as himself afterward declared, gave substantially for
   answer, that he had no other object in view than to preserve public
   tranquillity, which appeared to be much disturbed.

   But in a few days from, this time the plot unravelled itself. M. Neckar
   and the ministry were displaced, and a new one formed of the enemies of
   the revolution; and Broglio, with between twenty-five and thirty thousand
   foreign troops, was arrived to support them. The mask was now thrown off,
   and matters were come to a crisis. The event was, that in the space of
   three days the new ministry and their abettors found it prudent to fly the
   nation; the bastile was taken, and Broglio and his foreign troops
   dispersed, as is already related in a former part of this work."

   We shall now introduce Mr. Paine's description of the taking of the
   bastile, and then proceed with his life, or his connexion with these
   events and their consequences.

   "The mind can hardly picture to itself a more tremendous scene than which
   the city of Paris exhibited at the time of taking the bastile, and for two
   days before and after, nor conceive the possibility of its quieting so
   soon. At a distance, this transaction has appeared only as an act of
   heroism standing on itself: and the close political connexion it had with
   the revolution is lost in the brilliancy of the achievement. But we are to
   consider it as the strength of the parties, brought man to man, and
   contending for the issue. The bastile was to be either the prize or the
   prison of the assailants. The downfall of it included the idea of the
   downfall of despotism; and this compounded image was become as
   figuratively united, as Bunyan's Doubting Castle and giant Despair.

   The national assembly before and at the time of taking the bastile, was
   sitting at Versailles, twelve miles distant from Paris. About a week
   before the rising of the Parisians and their taking the bastile, it was
   discovered that a plot was forming, at the head of which was the Count
   d'Aitois, the king's youngest brother, for demolishing the national
   assembly, seizing its members, and thereby crushing, by a coup de main,
   all hopes and prospects of forming a free government. For the sake of
   humanity, as well as of freedom, it is well this plan did not succeed.
   Examples are not wanting to show how dreadfully vindictive and cruel are
   all old governments, when they are successful against what they call a
   revolt.

   This plan must have been some time in contemplation; because, in order to
   carry it into execution, it was necessary to collect a large military
   force round Paris, and to cut off the communication between that city and
   the national assembly at Versailles. The troops destined for this service
   were chiefly the foreign troops in the pay of France, and who, for this
   particular purpose, were drawn from the distant provinces where they were
   then stationed. When they were collected, to the amount of between
   twenty-five and-thirty thousand, it was judged time to put the plan into
   execution. The ministry who were then in office, and who were friendly to
   the revolution, were instantly dismissed, and a new ministry formed of
   those who had concerted the project:-among whom was Count de Broglio, and
   to his share was given the command of those troops. The character of this
   man, as described to me in a letter which I communicated to Mr. Burke
   before he began to write his book, and from an authority which Mr. Burke
   well knows was-good, was that of 'a high-flying aristocrat, cool, and
   capable of every mischief.'

   While these matters were agitating, the national assembly stood in the
   most perilous and critical situation that a body of men can be supposed to
   act in. They were the devoted victims, and they knew it. They had the
   hearts and wishes of their country on their side, but military authority
   they had none. The guards of Broglio surrounded the hall where the
   assembly sat, ready, at the word of command, to seize their persons, as
   had been done the year before to the parliament in Paris. Had the national
   assembly deserted their trust, or had they exhibited signs of weakness or
   fear, their enemies had been encouraged, and the country depressed. When
   the situation they stood in, the cause they were engaged in, and the
   crisis then ready to burst which should determine their personal and
   political fate, and that of their' country, and probably, of Europe, are
   taken into one view, none but a heart callous with prejudice, or corrupted
   by dependance, can avoid interesting itself in their success.

   The archbishop of Vienne was at this time president of the national
   assembly; a person too old to undergo the scene that a few days, or a few
   hours, might bring forth. A man of more activity, and bolder fortitude,
   was necessary; and the national assembly chose (under the form of
   vice-president, for the presidency still rested in the archbishop) M. de
   la Fayette; and this is the only instance of a vice-president being
   chosen. It was at the moment this storm was pending, July 11, that a
   declaration of rights was brought forward by M. de la Fayette, and is the
   same which is before alluded to. It was hastily drawn up, and makes only a
   part of, a more extensive declaration of rights, agreed upon and adopted
   afterward by the national assembly. The particular reason for bringing it
   forward at this moment (M. de la Fayette has since informed me) was, that
   if the national assembly should fall in the threatened destruction that
   then surrounded it,, some trace of its principles might have a chance of
   surviving the wreck.'

   Everything was now drawing to a crisis. The event was freedom or slavery.
   On one side an army of nearly thirty thousand men; on the other an unarmed
   body of citizens, for the citizens of Paris on whom the national assembly
   must then immediately depend, were as unarmed and undisciplined as the
   citizens of London are now. The French guards had given strong symptoms of
   their being attached to the national cause; but their numbers were small,
   not a tenth part of the force which Broglio commanded, and their officers
   were in the interest of Broglio.

   Matters being now ripe for execution, the new ministry made their
   appearance in office. The reader will carry in his mind, that the bastile
   was taken the 14th of July: the point of time I am now speaking to, is the
   12tb. As soon as the .news of the change of the ministry reached Paris in
   the after noon, nil the play-houses and places of entertainment, shops and
   houses, were shut up. The change of ministry was considered as the prelude
   of hostilities, and the opinion was rightly founded.

   The foreign troops began to advance toward the city. The Prince de
   Lambesc, who commanded a body of German cavalry, approached by the palace
   of Louis XV. which connects itself with some of the streets. In his-march
   he insulted and struck an old man with his sword. The French are
   remarkable for their respect to old age, and the insolence with which it
   appeared to be done, uniting with the general fermentation they were
   introduced a powerful effect, and a cry of To arms! to arms! spread itself
   in a moment over the whole city.

   Arms they had none, nor scarcely any who knew the use of them; but
   desperate resolution, when every hope is-at stake, supplies, for a while,
   the want of .arms. Near where the Prince de Lambesc was drawn up, were
   large piles of stones collected for building the new bridge, and with
   these the people attacked the cavalry. A party of the French guards, upon
   hearing the firing/rushed from their quarters and joined the people; and
   night coming on, the cavalry retreated.

   The streets of Paris, being narrow, are favorable for defence; and the
   loftiness of the houses, consisting of many stories, from which great
   annoyance might be given, secured them against nocturnal enterprises; and
   the night was spent in providing themselves with every sort of weapon they
   could make or procure: guns, swords, blacksmith's hammers, carpenters'
   axes, iron crows, pikes, halberds, pitchforks, spits, clubs, &c.

   The incredible numbers with which they assembled the next morning, and the
   still more incredible resolution they exhibited, embarrassed and
   astonished their enemies. Little did the new ministry expect such a
   salute. Accustomed to slavery themselves, they had no idea that liberty
   was capable of such inspiration, or that a body of unarmed citizens would
   dare to face the military force of thirty thousand men. Every moment of
   this day was employed in collecting arms, concerting plans, and arranging
   themselves in the best order which such an instantaneous movement could
   afford. Broglio continued lying round the city, but made no farther
   advances this day, and the succeeding night passed with as much
   tranquillity as such a scene could possibly produce.

   But the defence only was not the object of the citizens. They had a cause
   at stake, on which depended their freedom or their slavery. They every
   moment expected an attack, or to hear of one made on the national
   assembly; and in such a situation, the most prompt measures are sometimes
   the best. The object that now presented itself, was the bastile; and the
   eclat of carrying such a fortress in the face of such an army, could not
   fail to strike terror into the new ministry, who had scarcely yet had time
   to meet. By some intercepted correspondence this morning, it was
   discovered that the mayor of Paris, M. de Flessels, who appeared to be in
   their interest, was betraying them; and from this discovery there remained
   no doubt that Broglio would reinforce the bastile the ensuing evening. It
   was therefore necessary to attack it that day; but before this could be
   done, it was first necessary to procure a betteY supply of arms than they
   were then possessed of.''

   There was, adjoining to the city, a large magazine of arms deposited at
   the hospital of the invalids, which the citizens summoned to surrender;
   and as the place was not defensible, nor attempted much defence, they soon
   succeeded. Thus supplied, they marched to attack the bastile; a vast mixed
   multitude of all ages and of all degrees, and armed with all sorts of
   weapons. Imagination would fail of describing to itself the appearance of
   such a procession, and of the anxiety for the events which a few hours or
   a few minutes might produce. What plans the ministry was forming, were as
   unknown to the people within the city, as what the citizens were doing was
   unknown to them; and what movements Broglio might make for the support or
   relief of the place, were to the citizens equally unknown. All was mystery
   and hazard.

   That the bastile was attacked with an enthusiasm of heroism, such only as
   the highest animation of liberty could inspire, and carried in the space
   of a few hours, is an event which the world is fully possessed of. I am
   not undertaking a detail of the attack, but bringing into view the
   conspiracy against the nation which provoked it, and which fell with the
   bastile. The prison to which the new ministry were dooming the national
   assembly, in addition to its being the high altar and castle of despotism,
   became the proper object to begin with. This enterprise broke up the new
   ministry, who began now to fly from the ruin they had prepared for others.
   The troops of Broglio dispersed, and himself fled also."

   The taking of the bastile by a mob has astonished most persons acquainted
   with that fortress, and especially military men, who know the obstacle to
   such an undertaking, nor was' it generally understood how the moat was
   passed, or the draw-bridge let down. We learn, however, from Robert Dale
   Owen, who had the information from La Fayette, that the chain of the
   draw-bridge was struck by a well-aimed cannon-ball, or perhaps by a
   chain-shot, and the chain or chains being thus broken, the bridge fell,
   the mob rushed over, and effected the rest by gallantry. Sherwin thus
   speaks on this subject:-

   "The destruction of the bastile, and the universal diffusion of republican
   principles throughout the French empire, had rendered that country a
   singular object of terror to the English government. The mass of the
   nation saw with pleasure the dawn of French liberty, while the majority of
   their rulers beheld it as a treasonable invasion of the divine rights of
   monarchy. They dreaded the spirit of inquiry which it was calculated to
   diffuse, and they feared that the government of England, matchless and
   enviable as it was represented, would gain no credit by passing through
   the ordeal of national discussion. The first important attack that was
   made upon the principles of the French revolution was by Mr. Burke at the
   opening of parliament, 1790. This was followed by an advertisement in
   several of the newspapers, stating that he intended shortly to publish his
   opinions on the subject in the form of a pamphlet. The friends of liberty
   in this country were astonished at the sudden change in the politics of
   Mr. Burke, as he had, for several years previous, and particularly during
   the American war, been considered as a most eloquent and sincere advocate
   of public freedom. But it was shortly discovered that he had received a
   pension of three thousand pounds a year, and this sufficiently explained
   the grounds of his apostacy. At the period of his parliamentry attack on
   the French revolution, he corresponded with Mr. Paine, and so totally
   unexpected was his conduct, that the latter had written to him from Paris
   but a few weeks before, to inform him how prosperously matters were going
   on. When the advertisement was published announcing Mr. Burke's
   'Beflections,' Mr. Paine promised the friends of the French revolution
   that he would answer the work whenever it appeared. He left France in
   November, 1790, having been an attentive observer, if not an active
   adviser, of the important proceedings which had taken place during the
   preceding twelve months. Mr. Burke's book appeared soon after his arrival.
   The popularity of the author as a literary character, the exertions of the
   government and its agents in all parts of the country, the flowery and
   impassioned language in which the historical and declamatory parts of the
   book were clothed, and the repeated delays which had retarded its
   appearance, and, consequently, increased the anxiety of the public, all
   conspired to give the work an interest, which its profligacy ol principle'
   and perversity of sentiment were insufficient to overcome. The mass of his
   readers were captivated by his eloquence, and but a few took the trouble
   to reflect on the distorted facts, the real falsehoods, and the egregious
   absurdities, with which the book abounded.

   Mr. Paine lost no time in preparing; his answer to the work. In less than
   three months he produced the first part of ' Rights of Man,' in which he
   had combated and confuted the greater portion of Mr. Burke's doctrines.
   The work was printed in February, 1791, for Mr. Johnson, of St. Paul's
   Church Yard, but on looking it over he discovered some passages which he
   conceived were liable to be prosecuted, and he declined the publication.
   This refusal, which was altogether unexpected, occasioned a month's delay.
   After some difficulty, a publisher was at length found in Mr. Jordan, at
   No. 166, Fleet street, and the work was brought out on the 13th of March,
   1791.

   This publication had a two-fold object in view;-firstly, that of rousing
   the attention of the people of England to the defects and abuses of their
   own system of government; and secondly, that of refuting the falsehoods
   and exaggerations in Mr. Burke's 'Reflections.' Among other doctrines
   equally devoid of principle, Mr. Burke had published a commentary on the
   proceedings of the parliament of 1688, in which he had argued that the
   people of England, were bound by the declaration of the said parliament,
   who had consented 'to submit themselves, their heirs and posterities for
   ever,' to the heirs and posterity of William and Mary. Mr. Paine argues,
   that whatever right the parliament might have to submit themselves, they
   had not, and could not, have any right to enter into any agreement or
   contract respecting the government at posterity, for, says he, 'every age
   and generation must be as free to act for itself in all cases, as the age
   and generation which preceded it." A more self-evident position than this
   could not have been advanced, and the reflections naturally arising from
   it were quite sufficient to overturn the absurd conclusions which Mr.
   Burke had drawn from his omnipotent parliament of 1688.

   Our author then proceeds to refute his misrepresentations relative to the
   French revolution, and the causes of it. He enters into an elaborate
   detail of the events immediately preceding the overthrow of the ancient
   despotism, and of the consequences which it was calculated to produce. In
   speaking of the destruction of the bastile, and of Mr. Burke's silence on
   the subject, he thus beautifully expresses himself: "Not one glance of
   compassion, not. one commiserating reflection, that lean find throughout
   his book, has he bestowed on those who lingered out the most wretched of
   lives-a life without hope in the most miserable of prisons. It is painful
   to behold a man i employing his talents to corrupt himself. Nature has
   been kinder to Mr. Burke than he is to her. He is not affected by the
   reality of distress touching his heart, but by the showy resemblance of
   striking his imagination. He pities the plumage, but forgets the dying
   bird. Accustomed to kiss the aristocratic hand that hath purloined him
   from himself, he degenerates into a composition of art, and the genuine
   soul of nature forsakes him. His hero or his heroine must be a tragedy
   victim expiring in show, and not the real prisoner or misery sliding into
   death in the silence of a dungeon.' Mr. Paine reasons very deeply on the
   subject of rights, and the origin of government, in opposition to the
   dogmatical assertions and high-sounding declamation of his antagonist, and
   concludes his argument with a comparison between the constitutions of
   England and France, as the latter then stood under the authority of the
   national assembly. He ridicules the vanity of titles, and the policy of
   hereditary governors, and vindicates the conduct of the national assembly
   in abolishing the one, and neutralizing the authority of the other.

   It has been urged against the work before us, that the author had
   neglected to arrange his matter methodically. But it should be
   recollected, that he was compelled to follow the track of his opponent,
   which, as Mr. Paine very truly observes, was a complete 'wilderness of
   rhapsodies.' It was therefore impossible to preserve that order which in
   any other work would be considered essentially requisite. It may, however,
   be safely asserted, that the author's meaning is always clear, that his
   facts are always correctly stated, and that his arguments are
   incontrovertible. With respect to the merits of the work as a composition,
   its immense circulation and immediate effect in exciting an inquiry into
   the abuses of the English government, will answer for this part of the
   subject. Perhaps there never was a period in which the people of that
   country were less disposed to attend to the discussion of politics than at
   the time Mr. Paine's pamphlet made its appearance: they had been so often
   amused, and so often deceived, by men who pretended to advocate their
   rights, that they were disgusted with the subject, and the apostacy of Mr.
   Burke was a confirmation of their sentiments. But the principles contained
   in the 'Rights of Man,' opened an entirely new field of argument and
   inquiry, and the thinking part of the people began to view the right of
   political reform, not as a boon to be expected or desired from the
   government, but as a power which the nation alone had the authority to
   exercise.

   About the middle of May Mr. Paine again went to France. Soon after his
   arrival the king fled from Paris. On this occasion he observed to his
   friend Mr. Christie: 'You see the absurdity of monarchical governments.
   Here will be a whole nation disturbed by the folly of one man.' When the
   king returned to Paris, Mr. Paine was, from an accidental circumstance, in
   considerable danger of losing his life. An immense concourse of persons of
   all classes had assembled to witness the event. Among the crowd was Mr.
   Paine. An officer proclaimed the order of the national assembly, that all
   should be silent and covered. In an instant all hats were on. Mr. Paine,
   however, had lost his cockade, the, emblem of liberty and equality. The
   multitude observing that he remained uncovered, supposed that he was one
   of their enemies, and a cry instantly arose, 'Aristocrat! Aristocrat! a la
   lanterne! a la lantern! He was desired by those who stood near him to put
   on his hat, and it was sometime before the people could be satisfied by
   explanation.

   The Abbe Sieyes, who had been one of the principal authors of the new
   constitution, being alarmed at the partial excesses which had been
   committed by the populace, and falsely attributing them to the propagation
   of republican principles, avowed his intention of defending the
   monarchical against the democratical system of government. Mr. Paine
   readily accepted the challenge, and offered, in the short space of fifty
   pages, to controvert all the arguments which the abbe could bring forward
   in defence of his proposition. The latter prudently declined the contest,
   and thus the matter ended.

   On the thirteenth July, 1791, he returned to London, but it was not
   thought prudent that he should attend the public celebration of the French
   revolution, which was to take place on the following day. He was, however,
   present at the meeting which was held at the Thatched-House tavern, on
   the.twentieth of August following. Of the address and declaration which
   issued from this meeting, and which was at first attributed to Mr. Horne
   Tooke, Mr. Paine was the author. A second meeting was intended to have
   been held at the same place, for a similar purpose, but the proprietor of
   the tavern was so much alarmed at the clamors of the government party,
   that he was under the necessity of informing Mr. Home Tooke and his
   friends that he could not receive them.

   Mr. Paine was now very much engaged in preparing the second part of the
   'Rights of Man' for the press. In the mean time the ministry had received
   information that the work would shortly appear, and they resolved on
   getting it suppressed if possible. Having ascertained the name of the
   printer, they employed him to endeavor to purchase the copyright of the
   second, together with the future copyright of the first part of the
   'Rights of Man.' He began first by offering a hundred guineas, then five
   hundred, and at length a thousand; but Mr. Paine told him, that he 'would
   never put it in the power of any printer or publisher to suppress or alter
   a work of his, by making him master of the copy, or give him the right of
   selling it to any minister, or to any other person, or to treat as a mere
   matter of traffic that which he intended should operate as a principle."

   Finding that Mr. Paine was not to be bribed by pecuniary offers, the
   ministry next attempted to impede, since they could not suppress, the
   publication of the work, and in this they partially succeeded. Among other
   things, it contained several propositions relative to a reduction of the
   public taxes. It was intended to have appeared on the day, of the meeting
   of parliament, but when-the printer found it was not to be purchased, he
   suddenly stopped in the middle of the work, and informed Mr. Paine that he
   would not proceed with the remainder on any consideration. Another
   printer, therefore, became necessary, and this occasioned a delay of a
   fortnight. From the circumstances, elsewhere stated, there is every reason
   to conclude that the proof-sheets were regularly sent to the cabinet, and
   that the small addition to the pay of the soldiers, as well as several
   proposals for reducing the taxes brought for, ward by Mr. Pitt at the
   opening of parliament, were done for no other object than that of making
   it appear that Mr. Paine's plan was merely an improvement on that of the
   minister. But even in this paltry purpose the parties in power were
   defeated, by the exposure of the circumstances in the appendix to the
   work.

   The 'Rights of Man,' part the second, combining-principle and practice,
   was published by Mr. Jordan, of Fleet street, on the sixteenth of
   February, 1792. Exclusive of a dedication to M. de la Fayette, a preface
   and an introduction, it is divided into five chapters: chapter 1, on
   Society and Civilization; '2, on the Origin of the present old
   Governments; 3, on the old and new Systems of Government; 4, on
   Constitutions} 5, Ways and Means of reforming the Political Condition of
   Europe, interspersed with Miscellaneous Observations.

   The second part is, strictly speaking, a continuation of the first. The
   general design of the work appears to have been an investigation of the
   abuses of the English government; an examination of the hereditary and
   representative systems; to which are added, a variety of propositions for
   meliorating the condition of the nation. In going over this work, it is
   difficult to decide whether the ability or benevolence of the writer is
   the most deserving of our admiration. The most abstruse and difficult
   subjects in the science of politics are rendered intelligible and
   interesting, and the abuses which had, been accumulating for ages,' and
   which antiquity seemed to have rendered sacred and venerable, are examined
   with a degree of boldness, which is wholly without precedent or parallel.
   The generality of those who had previously written on the subject of
   government, appear to have drawn their principles from existing systems,
   and all that they had attempted to effect, was the correction of a few
   exterior abuses, without daring to invade the assumed rights of the
   establishment itself. But our author's attack was quite of a different
   nature: he not only deprecated the practice, but he condemned the
   principle; he not only declared his contempt for the monarch, but his
   detestation of the monarchy. He had studied the science of politics in the
   school of human nature, and he spoke as he felt, without reverencing, or
   even referring to the subtleties of the sophists who had gone before him.

   One of the great objects of the work was to do away with the delusive
   notion, that the members of the system ought to be expected to reform
   themselves. 'There does not,' says he,' exist within such governments,
   sufficient stamina whereon, to ingraft reformation.' 'The right of reform
   is in the nation, in its original character, and the constitutional method
   would be by a general convention elected for the purpose.' He likewise
   reasons with much energy in the first as well as the second part of the
   work against the prevalent opinions, with respect to the mixed system of
   government. 'A nation is not a body, the figure of which is to be
   represented, by the human body, but is like a body contained within a
   circle, having a common centre, in which every radius meets, and that
   centre is formed by representation. To connect representation with what is
   called monarchy, is eccentric government. Representation is of itself the
   delegated monarchy of a nation, and cannot debase itself by dividing it
   with another.' Indeed, it requires very little reflection to discover the
   impossibility of uniting democracy with monarchy or aristocracy, for any
   beneficial purpose. The union may exist in appearance, but it never can
   take place in fact. The dignified pride of republicanism disowns the base
   connexion.

   It is impossible to form an exact estimate of the number of copies which
   were circulated of the first and second parts of the 'Rights of Man,' but
   at a very moderate calculation there was at least a hundred thousand of
   each. When Mr. Paine saw the great interest which it excited, he thought
   the best mode of promulgating its principles, would be to give up the
   copyright in favor of the public, which he did about two months after the
   appearance of the second part. The probability of a revolution now became
   a subject of general discussion. The nation was divided into two numerous
   and powerful classes, the one consisting of the ignorant and the majority
   of the wealthy, arranged under the banners of civil and religious tyranny,
   and declaring their attachment to all that was superstitious in the
   church, and all that was despotic in the state- while the other, more
   numerous and less dependant, more enlightened though less opulent, being
   convinced that the government in its existing state, was the cause of the
   greater part of the misery with which the country was afflicted, were
   determined to let slip no opportunity of shaking off the load of
   oppression. That the different branches of government were in-a state of
   the completest trepidation, is a fact that admits of no question, and that
   many of the most intelligent men of all parties expected a revolution, is
   equally indisputable. It is recorded of a certain ancient philosopher, who
   lived under a capricious tyrant, that he used every morning, when he
   awoke, to feel whether his head was on his shoulders; and the state of the
   English people at length became so unsettled, and the stability of the
   government so problematical, that the king and his ministry might almost
   consider themselves in as precarious a situation.

   On the first appearance of the ' Rights of Man,' the ministry saw that it
   inculcated truths which they could not controvert, that it contained plans
   which, if adopted, would benefit at least nine tenths of the community,
   and that its principles were the reverse of the existing system of
   government; they therefore judged that the most politic method would be to
   treat the work with contempt, to represent it as a foolish and
   insignificant performance, unworthy of their notice, and undeserving of
   the attention of the public. But they soon found the inefficacy of this
   mode of treatment; the more contempt they showed, the more the book was
   read and approved of. Finding, therefore, that their declarations of
   contempt were as unsuccessful as their project of buying up the work, they
   determined upon prosecuting the author and publisher. Mr. Paine was not at
   all surprised at this resolution of the ministry; indeed, he had
   anticipated it on the publication of the second part of the work, and to
   remove any doubt as to his intention of defending the principles which he
   had so effectually inculcated, he addressed the following letter to his
   publisher:-

   'February 16, 1792. Sir: Should any person, under the sanction of any kind
   of authority, inquire of you respecting the author and publisher of the
   "Rights of Man," you will please to mention me as the author and publisher
   of that work, and show to such person this letter. I will as soon as I am
   made acquainted with it, appear and answer for the work personally.

                                           Your humble servant, Thomas Paine.

   Mr. Jordan, No. 166 Fleet Street.'

   The first intimation which Mr. Paine received of the intentions of the
   ministry, was on the 14th of May, 1792. He was then at Bromley in Kent,
   upon which he came immediately to town; on his arrival, he found that Mr.
   Jordan had that evening been served with a summons to appear at the court
   of King's Bench on the Monday following, but for what purpose was not
   stated. Conceiving it to be on account of the work, he appointed a meeting
   with Mr. Jordan, on the next morning, when he provided a solicitor, and
   took the expense of the defence on himself. But Mr. Jordan, it appears,
   had too much regard for his person to hazard its safety on the event of a
   prosecution, and he compromised the affair with the solicitor of the
   treasury, by agreeing to appear in court and plead guilty. This
   arrangement answered the purpose of both parties-that of Jordan in
   liberating him from the risk of a prosecution, and that of the ministry,
   since his plea of guilty amounted in some measure to a condemnation of the
   work.

   The following letter from Mr. Paine to Sir, Archibald Macdonald, the then
   attorney-general, will serve to confirm this statement:-

   'sir: Though I have some, reason for believing that you were not the
   original promoter or encourager of the prosecution-commenced against the
   work entitled 'Rights of Man,' either as that prosecution is intended to
   affect the author, the publisher, or the public; yet as you appear the
   official person therein, I address this letter to you, not as Sir
   Archibald Macdonald, but as attorney-general.

   You began by a prosecution against the publisher, Jordan, and the reason
   assigned by Mr. Secretary Dundas, in the house of commons, in the debate
   on the proclamation. May 25, for taking that measure, was, he said,
   because Mr. Paine could not be found, or words to that effect. Mr. Paine,
   sir, so far from secreting himself, never went a step out of his way, nor
   in the least instance varied from his usual conduct, to avoid any measure
   you might choose to adopt with respect to him. It is on the purity of his
   heart, and the universal utility of the principles and plans which his
   writings contain, that he rests the issue; and he will not dishonor it by
   any kind of subterfuge. The apartments which he occupied at the time of
   writing the work last winter, he has continued to occupy to the present
   hour, and the solicitors of the prosecution knew where to find him; of
   which there is a proof in their own office as far back as the 21st of May,
   and also in the office of my own attorney.

   But admitting, for the sake of the case, that the reason for proceeding
   against the publisher was, as Mr. Dundas stated, that Mr. Paine could not
   be found, that reason cart now exist no longer.

   The instant that I was informed that an information was preparing to be
   filed against me, as the author of, I believe, one of the most useful
   books ever offered to mankind, I directed my attorney to put in an
   appearance; and as I shall meet the prosecution fully and fairly, and with
   a good and upright conscience, I have a right to expect that no act of
   littleness, will be made use of on the part of the prosecution toward
   influencing the future issue with respect to the author. This expression
   may, perhaps, appear obscure to you, but I am in the
   possession of some matters which serve to show that the action against the
   publisher is not intended to be a real action. If, therefore, any persons
   concerned in the prosecution have found their cause so weak as to make it
   appear convenient to them to enter into a negotiation with the publisher,
   whether for the purpose of his submitting to a verdict, and to make use of
   the verdict so obtained as a circumstance, by way of precedent, on a
   future trial against myself;, or for any other purpose not fully made
   known to me; if, I say, I have cause to suspect this to be the case, I
   shall most certainly withdraw the defence  I should otherwise have made,
   or promoted, on his (the publisher's) behalf, and leave the negotiators to
   themselves, and shall reserve the whole of the defence for the real trial.

   But, sir, for the purpose of conducting this matter with at least that
   appearance of fairness and openness that shall justify itself before the
   public, whose cause it really is (for it is the right of public discussion
   and investigation that is questioned), I have to propose to you to cease
   the prosecution against the publisher; and as the reason or pretext can no
   longer exist for continuing it against him because Mr. Paine could not be
   found, that you would direct the whole process against me, with whom the
   prosecuting party will not find it possible to enter into any private
   negotiation.

   I will do the cause full justice, as well for the sake of the nation, as
   for my own reputation.

   Another reason for discontinuing the process against the publisher is,
   because it can amount to nothing. First, because a jury in London cannot
   decide upon the fact of publishing beyond the limits of the jurisdiction
   of London, and therefore the work may be republished over and over again
   in every county in the nation, and every case must have a separate
   process; and by the time that three or four hundred prosecutions have been
   had, the eyes of the nation will then be fully open to see that the work
   in question' contains a plan the best calculated to root out all the
   abuses of government, and to lessen the taxes of the nation upward of six
   millions annually.

   Secondly, because though the gentlemen of London maybe very expert in
   understanding their particular professions and occupations, and how to
   make business contracts with government beneficial to themselves as
   individuals, the rest of the nation may not be disposed to consider them
   sufficiently qualified nor authorized to determine for the whole nation on
   plans of reform, and on systems and principles of government. This would
   be in effect to erect a jury into a national convention, instead of
   electing a convention, and to lay a precedent 'for the probable tyranny of
   juries, under the pretence of supporting their rights.

   That the possibility always exists of packing juries will not be denied;
   and, therefore, in all cases where government is the prosecutor, more
   especially in those where the right of public discussion and investigation
   of principles and systems of government is attempted to be suppressed by a
   verdict, or in those where the object of the work that is prosecuted is
   the reform of abuse and the abolition of sinecure places and pensions, in
   all these cases the verdict of a jury will itself become a subject of
   discussion; and, therefore, it furnishes an additional reason for
   discontinuing the prosecution against the publisher, more especially as it
   is not a secret that there has been a negotiation with him for secret
   purposes, and for proceeding against me only. I shall make a much stronger
   defence than what I believe the treasury solicitor's agreement with him
   will permit him to do.

   I believe that Mr. Burke, finding himself defeated, and not being able to
   make any answer to the "Rights of Man," has been one of the promoters of
   this prosecution; and I shall return the compliment to him by showing, in
   a future publication, that he has been a masked pensioner at fifteen
   hundred pounds per annum for about ten years.

   Thus it is that the public money is wasted, and the dread of public
   investigation is produced. I am, sir,

   Your obedient humble servant,
   Thomas Paine.

   Sir A.macdonald, Attorney-General.'

   The business being thus settled with respect to Jordan, and he consenting
   to give up the documents in his possession relative to the 'Rights of
   Man,'in order to facilitate their means of proceeding against the author,
   they commenced their prosecution against the latter on the twenty-first of
   May. On the same day, they issued their celebrated proclamation against
   what they were pleased to term' seditious writings.' The authors of this
   document preserved a careful silence as to the specific object of their
   alarms, but it was easy to discover that their intention was to cry down
   the 'Rights of Man,' and to influence the verdict of the jury which was to
   try the author. Another expedient was likewise resorted to-that of
   procuring addresses in favor of the existing system of government from the
   corporations, rotten boroughs, and other places under the influence of the
   ministry. Nothing could be more despicable than these addresses, and
   nothing more glaring than the conduct of their promoters, who were chiefly
   persons directly or indirectly interested in the support of public abuses:
   but despicable as they were, they, served in some measure the purpose of
   the moment in decrying the character of a work, and defaming the
   reputation of a man whose arguments were unanswerable, and whose character
   was irreproachable. A great number of pamphlets, intended as answers to
   the 'Rights of Man,' had issued from the press, but such was the
   irresistible nature of truth, that these puny and feeble efforts on the
   part of wounded corruption no sooner appeared than they vanished, and a
   few short weeks consigned them and their authors to eternal oblivion. They
   therefore determined that an appeal to popular clamor would serve their
   .cause better than an .appeal to reason, and the Verdict of a packed jury
   would answer their purpose better than any attempt to argue the merits of
   the work on the principles of truth and justice.

   As a contrast to these contemptible and fulsome specimens of servility, I
   subjoin the following:-

   'At a meeting of the Manchester Constitutional Society, held this day, it
   was unanimously resolved- That the thanks of this society are due to Mr.
   Thomas Paine, for the publication-of his "Second Part of the Rights of
   Man, combining Principle and Practice," a work of the highest importance
   to every nation under heaven; but particularly to this as containing
   excellent and practical plans for an immediate and considerable reduction
   of the public expenditure; for the prevention of wars; for the extension
   of Our manufactures and commerce; for the education of the young; for the
   comfortable support of the aged; for the better maintenance of the poor of
   every description; and/finally, for lessening, greatly, and without delay,
   the enormous load of taxes under which this country at present-labors. t

   That this society congratulate their countrymen at large, on the influence
   which Mr. Paine's publications appear to have had, in procuring the repeal
   of some oppressive taxes in the present session of parliament; and they
   hope that this adoption of a small part of Mr. Paine's ideas, will be
   followed by the most strenuous exertions to accomplish a complete reform
   i?i the present inadequate state of the representation of the people, and
   that the other great plans of public benefit, which Mr. Paine has so
   powerfully recommended, will be speedily carried into effect. .' Thomas
   Walker, President.'

   March 13, 1792'' Samuel Jackson, Secretary.

   Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information. 'This society, composed
   chiefly of the manufacturers of Sheffield, began about four months ago,
   and is already increased to nearly two thousand members, and is daily
   increasing, exclusive of the adjacent towns and villages who are forming
   themselves into similar societies.

   Considering, as we do, that the want of knowledge and information in the
   general mass of the people, has exposed them to numberless impositions and
   abuses, the exertions of this society are directed to the acquirement of
   useful knowledge, and to spread the same as far as our endeavors and
   abilities can extend.

   We declare that we have derived more true knowledge from the two works of
   Mr. Thomas Paine, entitled "Rights of Man," parts the first and second,
   than from any author on the subject. The practice as well as the principle
   of government is laid down, in those works, in a manner so clear and
   irresistibly convincing, that this society do hereby resolve to give their
   thanks to Mr. Paine for his two said publications, entitled " Rights of
   Man," parts first and second.

   Resolved unanimously, That the thanks of this society be given to Mr.
   Paine, for the affectionate concern he has shown in his second work in
   behalf of the poor, the infant, and the aged; who, notwithstanding the
   opulence which blesses other parts of the community, are, by the grievous
   weight of taxes, rendered the miserable victims of poverty and
   wretchedness.

   Resolved unanimously, That the thanks of this society be given to John
   Home Tooke, Esq., for his meritorious support of our" lawful privileges,
   as a firm advocate of our natural and just rights, the establishment of an
   equal representation of the people.

   Resolved unanimously, That this society disdaining to be considered either
   of a ministerial or opposition party (names of which we are tired, having
   been so often deceived by both) do ardently recommend it to all their
   fellow-citizens, into whose hands these resolutions may come, to confer
   seriously and calmly with each other on the subject alluded to; and to
   manifest to the world, that the spirit of true liberty is a spirit of
   order; and that to obtain justice it is consistent that we be just to
   ourselves. ,

   Resolved unanimously, That these resolutions be printed, and that a copy
   thereof be transmitted to the Society for Constitutional Information,
   London, requesting their approbation for, twelve of our friends to be
   entered into their society for the purpose of establishing a connexion and
   a regular communication with that and all other similar societies in the
   kingdom.

   By order of the committee. March 14, 1792.' David Martin, Chairman."

   The above were selected from a number of others of a similar description.
   They show that Mr. Paine had the approbation of the most independent
   portion of the people, though his writings were not sanctioned by the
   aristocracy, the landed interest, or any other class interested in the
   protection of a corrupt system of government.

   While the ministers of despotism were thus revelling in the anticipation
   of their plots and schemes for crushing the rising spirit of the country,
   the author of the 'Rights of Man' was resolved not to shrink from the
   discussion which his writings had occasioned. He was' urged by several
   gentlemen of the law to prefer a bill of indictment against the publisher
   of the proclamation as a publication tending to influence the decision of
   the jury; but conscious of the rectitude of his intentions; and of the
   strength of his arguments, he preferred meeting the proclamation on its
   own ground, and defending the principles of the work which had been
   falsely stigmatized as wicked and seditious. Accordingly, about the month
   of August, 1792, he prepared another publication in defence of the 'Rights
   of Man' and of his own conduct, entitled, 'An Address to the Addressers on
   the late Proclamation.' This is one of the severest pieces of satire that
   ever issued from the press. The parliamentary orators on both sides the
   house, anxious to raise a popular outcry against the 'Rights of Man,' had
   commenced the session, by describing to the country and to each other
   blessings which were enjoyed under the British constitution. The praises
   which were bestowed upon the 'radical beauties' of this constitution, and
   the motives which produced them, are ridiculed by Mr. Paine in a fine
   strain of irony. Having informed the addressers of these symptoms of
   alarm, on the part of their mild and merciful governors, he proceeds to a
   defence of the principles of the ' Rights of Man.' He repeats his former
   arguments, and offers additional reasons for the positions he had
   advanced. He concludes this part of the pamphlet with these words, in
   reference to the impending prosecution: 'If to expose the fraud and
   imposition of every species of hereditary government; to lessen the
   oppression of taxes; to propose plans for the education of helpless
   infancy, and the comfortable support of the aged and distressed; to
   endeavor to conciliate nations to each other; to extirpate the horrid
   practice of war; to promote universal peace, civilization, and commerce;
   and to break the chains of political superstition, and raise degraded man
   to his proper rank; if these things be libellous, let me live the life of
   a libeller, and let the name of libeller be engraven on my tomb.'

   But though Mr. Paine was determined to take every opportunity pf defending
   his principles, he maintained that the case was deserving of a much more
   extensive consideration than could be bestowed upon it by any jury,
   whether special or common He contends in the work before us, that the
   question, was not so much whether he had or had not written what crown
   lawyers and packed juries are in the habit of condemning as wicked and
   seditious libels, but whether individuals had the right toy investigate
   systems and principles of government, and to publish the conclusions
   resulting from such investigation. It was this right which the ministry
   were invading under the pretence of prosecuting the author of the 'Rights
   of Man,' and while in appearance they were merely attempting to- suppress
   what they called the seditious writings of Mr. Paine, they were, in fact,
   aiming a deadly blow at the rights of every man in the country.

   It was at first Mr. Paine's intention to have defended himself personally,
   but an event happened about two months previous to the trial which
   disconcerted his purpose. While he was preparing his 'Letter to the
   Addressers,' his friends and admirers in trance were preparing a wreath of
   civic honors, as a reward for his intrepid exertions in defence of
   universal liberty. About the middle of September, 1792, a French
   deputation announced to him in London, that the department of Calais had
   elected him as their representative in the national convention. This was a
   matter of greater interest to him than the attorney-general's prosecution,
   and he proceeded to Dover with the intention of embarking immediately to
   Calais. The treatment which he met with at Dover was disgraceful in the
   extreme, his trunks were all opened, and the contents examined. Some of
   his papers were seized, and it is probable that the whole would have
   shared the same fate, but for the cool and steady conduct of Mr. Paine and
   his attendants. When the customhouse officers had indulged themselves in
   this manner as long as they thought proper, Mr. Paine and his friends were
   suffered to embark, and they arrived at Calais, after a pleasant passage
   of three hours. He very narrowly escaped the vigilance of the despots he
   had provoked, for it appears that an order to detain him was received at
   Dover, in about twenty minutes after his embarkation. The reception "which
   he met with at Calais, furnished a striking contrast to the conduct of the
   government agents at Dover. On the name of Paine being announced, the
   soldiers at the- gates were drawn up, and the officers on guard having
   embraced him, presented him with the national cockade. A very pretty
   woman, who was standing by, desired she might have the honor of putting it
   in his hat, expressing her hopes that he would continue his exertions in
   favor of liberty, equality, and France. A salute was then fired from the
   battery, to announce the arrival of their new representative. This
   ceremony being over, he walked to Deissein's, in the Rue de Egalite
   (formerly Rue de Rot), the men, women, and children, crowding around him,
   and calling out 'Vive Thomas Paine!' He was then conducted to the
   town-hall, and there presented to the municipality, who with the greatest
   affection embraced their representative. The mayor addressed him in a
   short speech, which was interpreted to him by his friend, and conductor,
   M. Audibert, to which Mr. Paine, laying his hand on his heart, replied,
   that his life should be devoted to their service.

   At the inn he was waited upon by the different persons in authority, and
   by the president of the Constitutional, society, who desired he would
   attend their meeting of that night: he cheerfully complied with the
   request, and the whole town would have been there, had there been room:
   the hall of the 'Minimes' was so crowded that it was with the greatest
   difficulty they made way for Mr. Paine to the side of the president. Over
   the chair he sat in, was placed the bust of Mirabeau, and th^ colors of
   France, England, and America united. A speaker acquainted him from the
   tribune with his election, amid the plaudits of the people. For some
   minutes after this ceremony, nothing was heard but ' Vive la Nation! Vive
   Thomas Paine,' in voices male and female.

   On the following day an extra meeting was appointed to he held in the
   church in honor of their new deputy to the convention, the Minimes being
   found quite suffocating from the vast concourse of people which had
   assembled on the previous occasion. A play was performed at the theatre on
   the evening after his arrival,- and a box was specifically reserved 'for
   the author of the "Rights of Man," the object of the English
   proclamation.'

   Mr. Paine was likewise elected as deputy for Abbeville, Beauvais, and
   Versailles, as well as for the department of Calais, but the latter having
   been the first in their choice, he preferred being their representative.

   After remaining with his constituents a short time, he proceeded to Paris
   in order to take his seat as a member of the National Assembly. On the
   road he met with similar honors to those which he had received at Calais.
   As soon as he had arrived at Paris, he addressed a letter to the people of
   France thanking his fellow-citizens for adopting him as their deputy to
   the convention.

   Mr. Paine was, shortly after his arrival in Paris, appointed a member of
   the committee for framing the new constitution. While he was peaceably and
   patriotically performing the duties of his station, the ministry of
   England were using every effort to counteract the (to them) dangerous
   principles which he had disseminated. For this purpose they filed a number
   of informations against the different individuals who had retailed the
   work. The trial of Mr. Paine came on at Guildhall, on the l6th of
   December, before Lord Kenyon, and a special I jury. The former being
   pensioned, and the latter being packed, a verdict of guilty followed- as a
   matter of course. The proceedings on this trial are not of much interest,
   except as they tend to develop the inquisitorial character of an English
   court of law in matters of libel. The attorney-general had selected a few
   passages from the second part of the 'Rights of Man,' which he thought
   were most likely to answer his purpose, and these, in the verbose
   vulgarity of the law; he stigmatized as false, wicked, scandalous, and
   seditious. He was prudent enough to refrain from any attempt to prove the
   truth of his charge, well knowing that, with such a judge and such a jury,
   abuse would be received as a substitute for argument and the coarsest and
   most improbable calumnies would be admitted as evidence of the writer's
   evil intention. The greater part of his speech to the jury was taken up
   with a comment on a letter relative to the prosecution, which Mr. Paine
   had written to him from Paris. In this letter he says: 'Had not my duty as
   a member of the national convention of France called me from England, I
   should have stayed to have contested the injustice of that prosecution;
   not upon my own account, for I cared not about the prosecution, but to
   have defended the principles 1 had advanced in the work.' He likewise
   delivers his opinion very freely, upon the capacity of the reigning king,
   and the profligacy of his sons, and very pointedly asks the
   attorney-general, whether he conceives such persons are necessary to the
   government of a nation % Mr. Erskine contended against the legal right of
   the prosecutor to avail himself of the contents of this letter, but the
   judge overruled the objection. Indeed the whole of the proceedings seem to
   have been marked out beforehand, and the trial seems to have been nothing
   but a convenient farce. Mr. Erskine addressed the jury for some hours, but
   his speech was rather an evasion of the charge, than a justification of
   the principles' he professed to defend. It was, as Mr. Paine observed, on
   seeing the report of the trial, 'a good speech for himself, but a very
   poor defence of the `Rights of'Man.' The jury found a verdict for the
   crown, without the trouble of deliberation.

   With respect to the different retailers of the work against whom
   informations were filed, their fate now became pretty evident. The
   ministry were-not satisfied with punishing the venders of ' Rights of
   Man;' they likewise instituted prosecutions against the publishers of
   the.' Letter to the Addressers,' and obtained several convictions. The
   following statement contains, I believe, a correct account of the number
   of prosecutions against these works:-

   A LIST OF THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED FOR THE PUBLICATION OF
   PAINE's WORKS.

   December 18, 1792. Thomas Paine, 'Rights of Man, Part II. convicted; went
   to France previous to the trial.

   February 26, 1793. Thomas Spence, 'Rights of Man, Part II.' flaw in the
   indictment; acquitted.

   William Holland. 'Address to the Addressers,' one year's imprisonment, and
   -L-100 fine.

   H. D. Symonds. 'Rights of Man,' two years imprisonment, and -L-20 fine.
   'Letter to the Addressers,' one year's imprisonment, -L-100, and two
   sureties of -L-250 each, and self for -L-500, for three years, and
   imprisonment till the fine be 'paid and sureties given.

   April 15. Thompson, printer, Birmingham,' Rights of Man' and 'Address to
   the Addressers;' acquitted.

   April 17. Richard Phillips, printer, Leicester, 'Rights of Man,;' eighteen
   months' imprisonment.

   May 8. J. Ridgway, bookseller, London; 'Rights of Man,' one year's
   imprisonment, and -L-100. 'Letter to the Addressers,' one year's
   imprisonment, and -L-100 fine; in each case, two sureties of -L-250 each,
   and self for -L-500 for three years and imprisonment till the fine be
   paid, and sureties given.

   June 3. D. I. Eaton, 'Rights of Man:' verdict which amounted to an
   acquittal. July 11. Do. 'Address to the Addressers:' do.

   Richard Peart and William Belcher,' Address to the Addressers,' and '
   Rights of Man;' imprisonment three months.

   August 10. Messrs. Robinsons, 'Rights of Man;' fine.

   Daniel Holt, bookseller, Newark, 'Address to the Addressers;' four years'
   imprisonment, and -L-50 fine.

   These prosecutions, though they were far from tranquillizing or satisfying
   the public mind, were certainly followed by one of their intended effects,
   that of suppressing the circulation of the work. Such was the acrimony
   with which the admirers of Mr. Paine were persecuted in all parts of the
   country, that it was regarded as highly dangerous for any" person to be
   found with the book in his possession; for though the law took no
   cognizance of such an act, the individual became a marked object of
   destruction, and so vigilant were the agents of tyranny, that their malice
   was sure to be gratified by one means or other. On the trials of Hardy,
   Tooke, and Thelwall, the circumstance of their having patronised the '
   Rights of Man' was made a very material ground for the charge of high
   treason, and though the accusation failed, the obloquy, which by this and
   other means was cast upon the work, tended very greatly to prevent its
   farther dissemination."

   We have hitherto only noticed the public character of Mr. Paine in
   England. Before we follow him into France, we shall extract from Clio
   Rickman's life of Paine, an article on his civil, social, or domestic
   habits, observing that Mr. Rickman was his friend and companion^ man of
   amiable disposition, extensively known, and esteemed wherever known. We
   knew the family, and are at this time intimate with those who were
   familiar with and companions of Mr. Rickman. This gentleman remarks:-

   "Mr. Paine's life in London was a quiet round of philosophical leisure and
   enjoyment. It was occupied in writing, in a small epistolary
   correspondence, in walking about with me to visit different friends,
   occasionally lounging at coffeehouses and public places, or being visited
   by a select few. Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the French and American
   ambassadors, Mr. Sharp, the engraver, Romney, the painter, Mrs.
   Wolstonecroft, Joel Barlow, Mr. Hull, Mr. Christie, Dr. Priestly, Dr.
   Towers, Colonel Oswald, the walking Stewart, Captain Sampson Perry, Mr.
   Tuffin, Ma William Choppin, Captain de Stark, Mr. Horne Tooke, &c., &c.
   were among the number of his friends and acquaintance; and, of course, as
   he was my inmate, the most of my associates were frequently his. At this
   time he read but little, took his nap after dinner, and played with my
   family at some game in the evening, as chess, dominoes, or draughts, but
   never at cards; in recitations, singing, music, &c.; or passed it in
   conversation: the part he took in the latter was always enlightened, full
   of information, entertainment, and anecdote. Occasionally we visited
   enlightened friends, indulged in domestic jaunts and recreations from
   home, frequently lounging at the White Bear, Piccadilly, with his old
   friend, the walking Stewart, and other clever travellers from France, and
   different parts of Europe and America.

   When by ourselves we sat very late, and often broke in on the morning
   hours, indulging the reciprocal interchange of affectionate and
   confidential intercourse. 'Warm from the heart and faithful to its fires,'
   was that intercourse, and gave to us the 'feast of reason and the flow of
   soul.'"

   "To return to Mr. Paine and the French convention. On the 25th of July,
   1792, the Duke of Brunswick issued his sanguinary manifesto: in this he
   stated that the allies were resolved to inflict the most dreadful
   punishments on the national assembly, and on the city of Paris, for their
   treatment of the royal family; he even went so far as to threaten to give
   up the place to military execution. The publication of this document threw
   the people of Paris into a state of complete confusion. They became
   frantic and furious, and the manifesto, instead of lulling them into
   repose, drove them to deeds of desperation. A party was soon formed in the
   convention for putting the king to death, and the agitated condition of
   the people facilitated the design. Mr. Paine labored hard to prevent this
   object from being carried into execution, but though his efforts produced
   a few converts to his doctrine, the majority of his' colleagues were too
   enraged with the duplicity of the king, and the detestable conduct of the
   foreign, monarchs, with whom he was leagued to listen to anything short of
   the most unlimited vengeance. The conduct of Louis was too reprehensible
   to be passed over in silence; Mr. Paine therefore voted that he should be
   tried, but when the question whether he should be condemned to death, was
   brought forward, he opposed it by every argument in his power. His
   exertions were, however, ineffectual, and sentence of death was passed,
   though by a very small majority. Mr. Paine was determined to ret slip no
   opportunity of protesting against this measure, and when the question,
   whether the sentence should be carried into execution, was discussed, he
   combated the proposition with great energy. As he was not in the habit of
   pronouncing French, one of the secretaries lead his discourse translated
   from the original English.

   It is evident that his reasoning was thought very persuasive, since those
   who had heard the discourses of Buzot, Condorcet, and Brissot, to the same
   purpose without interruption, broke out in murmurs white Paine's opinion
   was reading; and Marat, at length, losing all patience, exclaimed that
   Paine was a quaker, and insinuated that his mind being contracted by the
   narrow principles of his religion, was incapable of the liberality that
   was requisite for condemning men to death. This shrewd argument not being
   thought convincing, the secretary continued to read, that 'the execution
   of the sentence, instead of an act of justice, would appear to all the
   world, and particularly to their allies, the American States, as an act of
   vengeance and that if he were, sufficiently master of the French language,
   he would, in the name of his brethren of America, present a petition at
   thejr bar against the execution of the sentence. Marat and his associates
   said that these could not possibly be the sentiments of Thomas Paine, and
   that the assembly was imposed upon by a false translation. On comparing it
   with the original, however, it was found correct. v

   Though these exertions were frustrated, they were attended with one
   effect, that of rendering Mr. Paine an object of hatred among the most
   violent actors in the revolution. They found that he could not be induced
   to participate in their acts of cruelty; they dreaded the opposition which
   he might make to these sanguinary deeds, and they therefore marked him out
   as a victim to be sacrificed the first opportunity.

   The humanity of Mr. Paine was, indeed, one of the most prominent features
   in his character, and it was equally a matter of indifference to him
   whether the exercise of this high attribute of the human heart was
   required on a trivial or important, a public or private occasion. Of his
   strict attention to his public duty in this respect, even at the hazard of
   his own safety, we have a convincing proof in his opposition to the
   execution of the king, and of his humane and charitable disposition in a
   private point of view, the following circumstances are sufficient to
   warrant the most unqualified conclusion.

   Mr. Paine happened to be dining one day with about twenty friends at a
   coffee-house in the Palais Egalite, now the Palais Royal, when,
   unfortunately for the harmony of the company, a captain in the English
   service contrived to introduce himself as one of the party. The military
   gentleman was a strenuous supporter of the constitution in church and
   state, and a decided enemy of the French revolution. After the cloth was
   drawn, the conversation chiefly turned on the state of affairs in England,
   and the means which had been adopted by the government to check the
   increase of political knowledge. Mr. Paine delivered his opinion very
   freely, and much to the satisfaction of every one present, with the
   exception of Captain Grimstone, who returned his arguments by calling him
   a traitor to his country, with a variety of terms equally opprobious. Mr,
   Paine treated his abuse with much good humor, which rendered the captain
   so furious, that he walked up to the part of the room where Mr. Paine was
   sitting, and struck him a violent blow, which nearly knocked him off his
   seat. The cowardice of this behavior from a stout young man toward a
   person of Mr. Paine's age (he being then upward of sixty) is not the least
   disgraceful part of the transaction. There was, however, no time for
   reflections of this sort; an alarm was instantly given, that the captain
   had struck a citizen deputy of the convention, which was considered an
   insult to the nation at large; the offender was hurried into custody, and
   it was with the greatest difficulty that Mr. Paine prevented him from
   being executed on the spot.

   It ought to be observed, that an act of the convention had awarded the
   punishment of death to any one who should be convicted of striking a
   deputy: Mr. Paine was therefore placed in a very unpleasant situation. He
   immediately applied to Barrere, at that time president of the committee of
   public safety, for a passport for his imprudent adversary, who after much
   hesitation complied with his request. It likewise occasioned Mr. Paine
   considerable personal inconvenience to procure his liberation; but even
   this was not sufficient; the captain was without friends, and penniless,
   and Mr. Paine generously supplied him with money to defray his travelling
   expenses.

   The gentleman who favored me with the account of the foregoing
   circumstance, has likewise informed me of another anecdote equally
   honorable to Mr. Paine's feelings. A Major Munroe, who at the beginning of
   the revolution was employed by Mr. Pitt to send an account to the ministry
   of what was going on in Paris, remained there till after the declaration
   of war, when he, with many others, was sent to prison. He had previously
   occupied the same hotel with Mr. Paine, and though the latter was aware of
   his errand, he found him an intelligent companion. When the major was
   imprisoned, he applied to Mr. Paine, who after considerable trouble
   obtained his release. The major was recently living, and it is but fair to
   say, that he has often observed to his friends, he should ever feel
   indebted to the kindness of Mr. Paine, for the interest he employed in
   procuring his discharge.

   I have already noticed the feeling of hostility with which our author's
   exertions in the cause of humanity were received by some of the members of
   the convention. Those who had deserted the principles of liberty, and who,
   from the most treacherous and tyrannical motives, were anxious to plunge
   the nation into a state of anarchy, were naturally the enemies of the
   great defender of the 'Rights of Man,' and they were determined to gratify
   their vengeance, whenever a possibility of so doing should offer itself.
   Before entering into a description of the steps that were taken for this
   purpose I will give the reader an account of the mode in which he passed
   his time at the period we are speaking of.

   'In Paris, in 1793,' he observes, 'I had lodgings in the RuecFauxbourg St.
   Denis, No. 63. They were the most agreeable for situation of any I ever
   had in Paris, except that they were too remote from the convention, of
   which I was then a member. But this was recompensed by their being also
   remote from the alarms and confusion into which the interior of Paris was
   then often thrown. The news of those things used to arrive to us, as if we
   were in a state of quietude in the country. The house, which was enclosed
   by a wall and gateway from the street, was a good deal like an old mansion
   farm-house, and the court-yard was like a farm-yard stocked with fowls,
   ducks, turkeys, and geese; which, for amusement, we used to feed out of
   the windows of the parlor on the ground-floor. There were some huts for
   rabbits, and a stye with two pigs. Beyond, was a garden of more than an
   acre of ground, well laid out, and stocked with excellent fruit-trees. The
   orange, apricot, and the green-gage plum, were the best I ever tasted; and
   it is the only place where I saw the wild cucumber, which they told me is
   poisonous. The place had formerly been occupied by some curious person.'

   In allusion to the dreadful proceedings which were making such havoc among
   the best patriots of France, he continues:-

   'As for myself, I used to find some relief by walking alone in the garden
   after it was dark, and cursing with hearty good will the authors of that-
   terrible system that had turned the character of the revolution I had been
   proud to defend.

   I went but little to the convention, and then only to make my appearance;
   because I found it impossible for me to join in their tremendous decrees,
   and useless and dangerous to oppose them. My having voted and spoken
   extensively, more so than any other member, against the execution of the
   king, had already fixed a mark upon me: neither dared any of my associates
   in the convention to translate, and speak in French for me anything I
   might have dared to write. Pen and ink were then of no use to me. No good
   could be done by writing, and no printer dared to print; and whatever I
   might have written for any private amusement, as anecdotes of the times,
   would have been continually exposed to be examined, and tortured into any
   meaning that the rage of party might fix upon it; and as to softer
   subjects, my heart was in distress at the fate of my friends, and my harp
   was hung upon the weeping willows.'

   At this period the national convention was divided into factions, each
   intent on their own aggrandizement, and each possessing a powerful host of
   partisans among the people. Terror, hatred, suspicion, revenge, and every
   other dark and deadly passion, had supplanted the just, liberal, and
   humane principles which marked the commencement of the revolution, and the
   wide empire of France became one vast slaughterhouse, where the supporters
   of freedom and the advocates of despotism were alternately sacrificed at
   the shrine of factions violence. The exertions of the friends of liberty
   sooner increased than lessened the effects of the storm, and to defend the
   interests of truth and the rights of the people, was to invite
   destruction. The voice of humanity was mute, for the ear of humanity was
   closed. It is painful to recur to these heart-rending scenes, but justice
   requires it, and more particularly so, as Mr. Paine was very near falling
   a victim to the violence of the contending factions.',

   The gentle, conciliating, and open method in which he had conducted
   himself, had prevented the possibility of impeaching his political
   conduct, and to this we must attribute the circumstance of his remaining
   so long at liberty. The first attempt that was made against him, was by
   means of an act of the convention, which decreed that all persons residing
   in France who were born in England should be imprisoned; but as Mr. Paine
   was a member of the convention, and had been complimented with the title
   of 'citizen of France,' the decree did not extend to him. A motion was
   afterward made by Bourdon de l'Oise, for expelling foreigners from the
   convention. It was evident from the speech of the mover, that Mr. Paine
   was the principal object aimed at, and as soon as the expulsion was
   effected, an application was made to the two committees of public safety
   and general surety, of which Robespierre was the dictator, and they
   immediately put him in arrestation under the former decree for impris6ning
   persons born in England. On his way to the Luxembourg he contrived to call
   upon his intimate friend and associate, Joel Barlow, with whom he left the
   manuscript of the first part of the 'Age of Reason.' This work he intended
   to be the last of his life, but the proceedings in France, during the year
   1793, induced him to delay it no longer. 'The circumstance,' says he,
   'that has now taken place in France, of the total abolition of the whole
   national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive
   systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only
   precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly
   necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of
   government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity,
   and of the theology that is true.' At the time this performance was
   written, Mr. Paine was in almost daily expectation of being sent to the
   guillotine, where many of his friends had already perished; the doctrines,
   therefore, which it inculcates, must be regarded as the sentiments of a
   dying man. This is at least a conclusive proof that the work was not the
   result of a wish to deceive, that, whether true or false, it was the
   effusion of a disinterested mind; and, in ordinary cases, the fact of a
   man writing a book under such circumstances, would be admitted as a
   logical evidence of the rectitude of the doctrines it contained. I do not,
   however, intend to enter .into any discussion relative to our author's
   religious opinions, until we arrive at the second part of the work. It is,
   therefore, only necessary at present, to observe, that Mr. Paine had
   measured his time with such a degree of precision, that he had not
   finished the book more than six hours before he was arrested and conveyed
   to the Luxembourg.

   Mr. Paine had remained in prison about three weeks, when it was
   ascertained to the satisfaction of every one in Paris, except the tyrants
   who had sent him there, that he had committed no offence; and in
   consequence of this, the Americans residing in that city, went in a body
   to the convention to demand the liberation of their fellow-citizen and
   friend. The following is a copy of the address presented by them to the
   president of the convention; an address which sufficiently shows the high
   estimation in which Mr. Paine was at this time held by the citizens of the
   United States:-

   'Citizens! The French nation had invited the most illustrious of all
   foreign nations to the honor of representing her. Thomas Paine, the
   apostle of liberty in America, a profound and valuable philosopher, a
   virtuous and esteemed citizen, came to France and took a seat among you.
   Particular circumstances rendered necessary the decree to put under arrest
   all the English residing in France.

   Citizens! representatives! We come to demand of you Thomas Paine, in the
   name of the friends of libertv, and in the name' of the Americans, your
   brothers and allies; was there anything more wanted to obtain your demand
   we would tell you. Do not give to the leagued despots the pleasure of
   seeing Paine in irons. We shall inform you that the seals put .upon the
   papers of Thomas Paine have been taken off, that the committee of general
   safety examined them, and far from finding among them any dangerous
   propositions, they only found the love of liberty which characterized him
   all his lifetime, that eloquence of nature and philosophy which made him
   the friend of mankind, and those principles of public morality which
   merited the hatred of kings, and the affection of his fellow-citizens.

   In short, citizens! if you permit us to restore Thomas Paine to the
   embraces of his fellow-citizens, we offer to pledge ourselves as
   securities for his conduct during the short time he shall remain in
   France'.'

   The Americans who presented the foregoing address, received for answer,
   that 'Mr. Paine was born in England,' and it was likewise hinted to them
   that their attempt to reclaim him as a citizen of the United States, could
   not be listened to, in consequence of its not being authorized by the
   American government.

   A few days after this, all communication between persons imprisoned, and
   any person without the prison, was cut off, by an order of the police. In
   this forlorn and solitary situation Mr. Paine continued for six months,
   and the only hope that remained for him was, that a new minister would
   arrive from America to supersede Morris, and that he would be authorized
   to inquire into the causes of his imprisonment; `but even this hope,' Mr.
   Paine observes, 'in the state in which matters were daily arriving, was
   too remote to have any consolatory effect; and I contented myself with the
   thought that I might be remembered when it would be too late.'

   During this long imprisonment he amused himself as well as such a gloomy
   situation would allow, by writing various pieces of fancy, both in poetry
   and prose, some of which have since been published. He likewise wrote a
   considerable proportion of the second part of the 'Age of Reason ' during
   his incarceration. When he had been in prison about eight months, he was
   seized with a violent fever, which nearly deprived him of life, and from
   the effects of which he never afterward perfectly recovered. This fever,
   which rendered him completely insensible for more than a month, was
   evidently the means of preserving his life. Had he remained in health he
   would probably, according to the routine of the times, have been dragged
   before the tribunal, and sent to the guillotine, without the trouble of
   proving either his guilt or his innocence. But the fever fortunately
   averted the impending danger, and the first thing he heard of after his
   recovery was the fall of Robespierre. But the fate of this sanguinary man
   did not restore him to liberty. The desolator was overthrown, but his
   faction still remained, and, though considerably humbled, their hostility
   toward Mr. Paine was unabated. The latter seeing that several of his
   fellow-prisoners were released, addressed a memorial to Mr. Monroe (who it
   appears had received no instructions from the American government
   respecting Mr. Paine), on the subject of his confinement, who behaved
   toward him with great kindness and attention. The following is a copy of
   Mr. Monroe's letter to Mr. Paine on this occasion:-

                                                   Paris, September 18, 1794.

   'dear Sir: I was favored, soon after my arrival here, with several letters
   from you, and more latterly with one in the character of a memorial upon
   the subject of your confinement: and should have answered them at the
   times they were respectively written, had I not concluded, you would have
   calculated with certainty upon the deep interest I take in your' welfare,
   and the pleasure with which I shall embrace every opportunity in my power
   to serve you. I should still pursue the same course, and for reasons which
   must obviously occur, if I djd not find that you are disquieted with
   apprehensions upon interesting points, and which justice to you and our
   country equally forbid you should entertain. You mention that you have
   been informed you are not considered as an American citizen by the
   Americans, and that you have likewise heard that I had no instructions
   respecting you by the government. I doubt not the persons who gave you the
   information meant well, but I suspect he did not even convey accurately
   his own ideas on the first point: for I presume the most he could say is,
   that you had likewise become a French citizen, and which by no means
   deprives you of being an American one. Even this, however, may be doubted,
   I mean the acquisition of citizenship in France, and I confess you have
   said much to show that it has not been made. I really suspect that this
   was all that the gentleman who wrote to you, and those Americans he heard
   speak upon the subject, meant. It becomes my duty, however, to declare to
   you, that I consider you as an American citizen, and that you are
   considered universally in that character by the people of America. As such
   you are entitled to my attention; and so far as it can be given,
   consistently with those obligations which are mutual between every
   government and even transient passenger, you shall receive it.

   The congress have never decided upon the subject of citizenship, in a
   manner to regard the present case. By being with us through the
   revolution, you are of our country as- absolutely as if you had been born
   there, and you are no more of England than every native American is. This
   is the true doctrine in the present case, so far as it becomes complicated
   with any other consideration. I have mentioned it to make you easy upon
   the only point which could give you any disquietude.

   It is necessary for me to tell you, how much all your countrymen-I speak
   of the great mass of the people--are interested in your welfare. They have
   not forgotten the history of their own revolution, and the difficult
   scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its several stages
   without reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the merits of those
   who served them in that great and arduous conflict. The crime of
   ingratitude has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain, our
   national character. You are considered by them, as not only having
   rendered important services in our own revolution, but as being, on a more
   extensive scale, the friend of human rights, and a distinguished and able
   advocate in favor of public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas Paine, the
   Americans are not, nor can they be, indifferent.

   Of the sense which the president has always entertained of your merits,
   and of his friendly disposition toward you, you are too well assured, to
   require any declaration of it from me. That I forward his wishes in
   seeking your safety is what I well know: and this will form an additional
   obligation on me to perform what I should otherwise consider as a duty.

   You are in my opinion, at present, menaced by no kind of danger. To
   liberate you will be an object of my endeavors, and as soon as possible.
   But you must, until that event shall be accomplished, bear your situation
   with patience and fortitude; you will likewise have the justice to
   recollect, that I am placed here upon a difficult theatre, many important
   objects to attend to, and with few to consult. It becomes me in pursuit of
   those, to regulate my conduct with respect to each, as to the manner and
   the time, as will, in my judgment, be best calculated to accomplish the
   whole.

   With great esteem and respect consider me personally your friend.

                                                               James Monroe.'

   Mr. Paine was released from prison on the 4th of November, 1794, having
   been in confinement for eleven months.

   After his liberation he was kindly invited to the house of Mr. Monroe,
   with whom he remained for about eighteen months. I intend to be as
   brief-in my extracts as the subject will admit; but the following, which
   is taken from one of his letters, written after his return to America, is
   so descriptive of his situation while in prison, and of another narrow
   escape which he had in addition to the one already noticed, that I
   consider it necessary for the information of the reader.

   'I was one of the nine members that composed the first committee of
   constitution Six of them have been destroyed: Syeyes and myself have
   survived. He by bending with the times, and I by not bending. The other
   survivor joined Robespierre, and signed with him the warrant of my
   arrestation. After the fall of Robespierre, he was seized and imprisoned
   in his turn, and sentenced to transportation. He has since apologized to
   me for having signed the warrant, by saying, he felt himself in danger and
   was obliged to do it.

   Herault Sechelles, an acquaintance of Mr. Jefferson, and a good patriot,
   was my suppliant as member of the committee of constitution; that is, he
   was to supply my place, if I had not accepted or had resigned, being next
   in number of votes to me. He was imprisoned in the Luxembourg with me, was
   taken to the tribunal and the guillotine, and I, his principal, was left.

   There were but two foreigners in the convention, Anacharsis Cloots and
   myself. We were both put out of the convention by the same vote, arrested
   by the same order, and carried to prison together the same night. He was
   taken to the guillotine, and I was again left. Joel Barlow was-with us
   when we went to prison.

   Joseph Lebon, one of the vilest characters that ever existed, and who made
   the streets of Arras run with blood, was my suppliant as member of the
   convention for the department of the Pais de Calais. When I was put out of
   the convention he came and took my place. When I was liberated from
   prison, and voted again into the convention, he was sent to the same
   prison and took my place there, and he went to the guillotine instead of
   me. He supplied my place all the way through.

   One-hundred and sixty-eight persons were taken out of the Luxembourg in
   one night, and a hundred and sixty of them guillotined the next day, of
   which I know I was to have been one; and the manner I escaped that fate is
   curious, and has all the appearance of accident. .,

   The room in which I was lodged was on the ground floor, and one of a long
   range of rooms under a gallery, and the door of it opened outward and flat
   against the wall, so that when it was open the inside of the door appeared
   outward, and the contrary when it was shut. I had three comrades,
   fellow-prisoners with me, Joseph Vanhuile of Bruges, since president of
   the municipality of that town, Michael Robins, and Bastini of Louvain.:

   When persons by scores and hundreds were to be taken out of prison for the
   guillotine, it was always done in the night, and those who performed that
   office had a private mark or signal by which they knew what rooms to go
   to, and what number to take. We, as I have said, were four, and the door
   of our room was marked unobserved by us, with that number in chalk; but it
   happened, if happening is a proper word, that the mark was put on when the
   door was open and flat against the wall, and thereby came on the inside
   when we shut it at night, and the destroying angel passed by it. A few
   days after this Robespierre fell, and the American ambassador arrived and
   reclaimed me and invited me to his house.

   During the whole of my imprisonment, prior to the fall of Robespierre,
   there was no time when I could think my life worth twenty-four hours, and
   my mind was made up to meet its fate. The Americans in Paris went in a
   body to the convention to reclaim me, but without success. There was no
   party among them with respect to me. My only hope then rested on the
   government of America that it would remember me. But the icy heart of
   ingratitude, in whatever man it may be placed, has neither feeling nor
   sense of honor. The letter of Mr. Jefferson has served to wipe away the
   reproach, and done justice to the mass of the people of America.'

   Soon after Mr. Paine's release from prison the convention passed a
   unanimous vote to invite him to return to the seat he had formerly
   occupied. The times were still dangerous, as well from without as within,
   for the coalition of foreign despots was unbroken, and the constitution
   not settled. Mr. Paine however, thought proper to accept the invitation,
   being resolved to show that he was not to be alarmed either by prospects
   of retrospects of danger, and that his principles were neither to be
   perverted by disgust nor weakened by misfortune.

   He was liberated, as before stated, in November, 1794; his bodily health
   was at this time very much impaired by long confinement, and in September
   following he was taken dangerously ill. He states that he had felt the
   approach of his disorder for some time, which occasioned him to hasten-to
   a conclusion of the second part of the 'Age of Reason.' This work was
   published at Paris, early in 1795, and was very shortly afterward
   reprinted in England, and the United States. At the time he wrote the
   first part of the work he was without a bible, nor could he procure one.
   The investigation which it contained was therefore rather a general, than
   a detailed inquiry into the Jewish and Christian systems of belief. The
   first point which he attacks is the doctrine of revelation: He admits the
   possibility, though he denies the probability of the Supreme Being having
   ever held personal communication with man. But even allowing this to be
   the case, he observes, that 'revelation is necessarily limited to the
   first communication. After this it is only on account of something which
   that person says was revelation made to him; and though he may find
   himself obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it
   .in the same manner, for it was not revelation made to me, and I have only
   his word for it that it was made to him.'

   In this manner he proceeds to controvert the principal arguments in favor
   of Christianity. He asserts that it is a system founded entirely upon
   hearsay evidence, and that we are not obliged to believe it. He next
   endeavors to show the similarity of the heathen mythology, and that of the
   Christians, from which he infers that the latter is a copy of the former.
   Among the novel positions which he advanced, was an argument to prove that
   the word prophet had changed its original meaning, that in former times it
   was synonymous with that of pod or musician; to prove this he cites the
   part of the Bible, where we are told the prophets of old performed the
   functions of the/r vocation by means of pipes, tabrets, horns, harps, and
   other musical instruments. Having declared his disbelief of what is called
   revealed religion, and his reasons for such disbelief, he next gives his
   opinion as to what he conceives to be the only true word of God-the only
   true revelation; and as his ideas on this subject are of no ordinary
   stamp, 1 insert them in his own words, as the best mode of doing justice
   to the author:-

   'It is only in the Creation that all our ideas and conceptions of a word
   of God can unite. The creation speaketh a universal language,
   independently of human speech or human language, multiplied and various as
   they be. It is an ever-existing original, which every man can read. It
   cannot be forged; it cannot be counterfeited; it cannot be lost; it cannot
   be altered; it cannot be suppressed. It does not depend upon the will of
   man whether it shall be published or not: it publishes itself from one end
   of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and to all worlds;
   and this word of God reveals to man all that is necessary for man to know
   of God.

   Do we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the immensity of the
   creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom? We see it in the
   unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible whole is governed. Do we
   want to contemplate his munificence? We see it in the abundance with which
   he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy 1 We see it in his
   not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful. In fine, do we
   want to know what God is 1 Search not the book called the Scripture, which
   any human hand might make, but the scripture called the Creation.'

   It is not hazarding too much to say that the above breathes as pure a
   spirit of morality and philosophy, as anything that was ever written on
   the subject, in either ancient or modern times. It is superior to the
   bible description of the Deity, for it ascribes to him none of those
   weaknesses and passions which are so frequently attributed to him by the
   authors of that book. It is not at all wonderful that the ministers of a
   corrupt system of religion should calumniate the character of a work,
   which inculcates the practice of morality as the only religious duty that
   men are bound to perform, which teaches the most sublime and reverential
   ideas of the Creator of the universe, and which represents the
   intercessions of ignorant and bigoted priests, as unnecessary either to
   the present or future happiness of mankind-it is not at all wonderful that
   such men should look upon such a work with horror, and load its author
   with every epithet of calumny and reproach. They are in religion, what
   courtiers are under a limited monarchy. Both parties are, in nine cases
   out of ten, aware of the farce, and they tremble at the approach of reason
   and investigation.

   From a great portion of the work before us, it is evident that Mr. Paine
   possessed an extensive knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, and the
   mode in which he applies these branches of science, to prove the ignorance
   of the bible writers, and the falsehood of their statements, is worth the
   reader's attention. For this, however, I must refer him to the work
   itself. The extract which I have already given will enable any person to
   form an idea of the general character of the book, its principles and
   tendency; I therefore proceed to offer a few observations on the second
   part.

   This work is divided into an examination, first, of the Old, and,
   secondly, of the New Testament. In the former our author examines the
   different books of the Bible in rotation, and proves, very clearly, as far
   as the evidence of circumstances can go, that they were not written by the
   persons to whom they are ascribed, and, therefore, that they are anonymous
   and without authority. He likewise reasons very forcibly against the
   various acts of horrid cruelty, and gross immorality, which are attributed
   to the Almighty by Moses, and the other reputed authors of the Bible. In
   this examination the ancient Jews are stripped of the disguise in which
   commentators generally clothe them, and exposed in their true
   character-that of the most ignorant and ferocious race of beings which
   ever disgraced the character of human nature. Their ignorance is inferred
   from the circumstance of there not being in the whole Bible more than one
   book in which any branch of useful or scientific knowledge is mentioned
   (the book of Job) and this it appears is a book of the Gentiles and not of
   the Jews. The ferocity of their character is established by the almost
   innumerable and unprovoked murders with which the Scriptures are filled,
   arid which are blasphemously ascribed to the God of mercy and eternal
   beneficence."

   These are the principal grounds on which our author argues against the
   divinity of the Bible. In the examination of the New Testament, he exposes
   the contradictions of the different writers, he cites authorities to prove
   that the gospels were not written till a long time after the evangelists
   are reported to have lived; and that they were not formed into a book for
   more than three hundred years after the death of Christ. They were then
   collected together by the church, and it was decided by vote which were
   and which were not the word of God.

   The work likewise contains some fine ideas on the doctrine of immortality:
   these form a striking contrast to the gloomy and unnatural doctrines of
   the resurrection.

   On a superficial view of the subject it appears wonderful that a system of
   belief which is liable to so many objections, not only on the score of
   probability, but on that of the common principles of morality, should have
   obtained so general an influence among mankind. But when we look at the
   means which have been used to propagate its principles, we may cease to be
   surprised at the general credence it has acquired. Its professors preached
   peace and humility, until, by the increase of their numbers, they were
   enabled to assume a more formidable tone, but so slow was their progress,
   and with such general contempt were their doctrines viewed, that even this
   accession of strength did not take place until three or four centuries
   after the death of their founder. As the number of their converts
   increased, their temporal power became more extensive, and all attempts to
   investigate the truth of their pretensions were put down as impious
   heresies. Thus, in the first instance, their faith was protected by its
   obscurity and the professed humility of its disciples; in latter times it
   has been promoted by means of the sword, and the assiduity of the
   priesthood; while all inquiry into the probability or improbability of its
   precepts, has been suppressed by the powerful Reasoning of the fagot and
   the inquisition.

   It is not to be denied that the New Testament contains some good moral
   maxims, but these are no proofs of its divinity, for they existed
   thousands of years before the appearance of Christ, and they will exist
   when all the desolating wars and shocking persecutions which have been
   occasioned by the Christian system of faith, shall be sunk in the Lethean
   stream of oblivion. They are inherent in human nature, and they
   consequently do not depend upon the belief of any particular system of
   opinions. It may suit the convenience of the pious teachers of our
   established religion, to tell us that the practice of virtue, the
   foundation of our happiness here and of our hopes hereafter, are dependant
   on the practice of their absurd ceremonies, and the belief of their
   improbable doctrines; but it is impossible for the reflecting mind to
   discover in these dogmas anything more than the motives of an interested
   priesthood, or the effusions of a distempered imagination. The principles
   of moral virtue are essentially distinct from the belief of any existing
   system of faith, they result from the relations of a being with his
   fellow-beings; justice toward ourselves is wisdom; justice toward others
   is virtue. In society all is relative, there is no happiness independent;
   we are compelled to sacrifice a part of what we might enjoy, not to be
   deprived of the whole, and to secure a portion against all assaults. Even
   here the balance is in favor of reason.

   However laborious may be the life of the honest man, however encompassed
   with dangers, however beset with difficulties it may be, that of the
   vicious character must be more so. He can seldom be tranquil who stands in
   opposition to the interests of his fellow-men; it is impossible for him to
   conceal from him-self that he is surrounded by enemies, or by those who
   are ready to become so, and this situation is always painful, however
   splendid may be appearances. Let us add to these considerations, the
   sublime rectitude of instinct, which corruption may lead astray, but which
   no false philosophy can ever annihilate, which impels us to admire and
   love wisdom and generosity of conduct, as we do grandeur and beauty in
   nature and the arts; and we shall have the source of human virtue,
   independent of every religious system of the intricacies of metaphysics,
   and of the impostures of priests.

   The publication of the 'Age of Reason' called forth a great variety of
   replies, but the only one which is now remembered is the Bishop of
   Llandaff's 'Apology for the Bible.' It is much to be doubted whether this
   work, which is written in open defiance of the plainest rules of reason
   and logic, would have survived the fate of its companions in the same
   cause, if it had been written by any other person. His character in the
   world of letters, and in several of the departments in science, coupled
   with his conduct in parliament, which induced many to regard him as an
   independent promoter of the gospel, gave the work an importance which its
   contents by no means deserved, and the friends of the church lost no time
   in publishing it throughout the country. Their zeal in this respect,
   perhaps, in some measure, answered the purpose they had in view, but lit
   certainly conferred no honor on the bishop's literary reputation.

   Whether the advocates of the Christian faith were or were not conscious of
   the imperfections of their system, it is evident they were afraid of an
   inquiry into its merits, and a prosecution was commenced against Mr.
   Williams, the publisher of the 'Age of Reason.' By way of giving a color
   to this proceeding, they retained Mr. Erskine on the part of the crown,
   who strained every effort to procure a verdict. Mr. Kyd made an ingenious
   and argumentative reply, in behalf of the defendant, but the jury, being
   special, readily found him guilty, June. 4, 1797. Mr. Paine addressed
   a-letter to Mr. Erskine on the proceedings of this trial, in which he
   ridicules the absurd practice of discussing theological subjects before
   such men as special juries are generally composed of, and cites fresh
   evidence in support of his former arguments respecting the Bible.

   Mr. Paine now attended his duty as a member of the convention, in which
   capacity he delivered his. opinions whenever occasion required. In April,
   1795, a Committee was appointed to form another new constitution (the
   former one having been abolished) and the report of this committee was
   brought forward on the 23d of June following, by Boissy d'Anglas. This was
   the constitution of elders and youngsters, a council of five hundred, a
   council of ancients, and an executive directory of five. Mr. Paine wrote a
   speech in opposition to several of the articles of this constitution,
   which was translated and read to the convention by Citizen Lanthera, on
   the seventh of July. One of the subjects against which Mr. Paine
   contended, was the unjust distinction that was attempted to be made
   between direct and indirect taxes. Whatever weight these objections ought
   to have carried, they were not listened to by the convention, and the
   constitution of Boissy d'Anglas was adopted. By this decree the convention
   was formally destroyed, and as Mr. Paine was not afterward re-elected, it
   likewise terminated his public functions in France. ,

   The reign of terror having in some degree subsided, our author's political
   pen returned to its former employment. About the time that he brought out
   the second part of the 'Age of Reason,' he published several pamphlets on
   subjects less likely to inflame the passions of the bigoted and the
   ignorant, than investigations into the nature of theology. The principal
   of these are his 'Dissertation on first Principles of Government,'
   'Agrarian Justice opposed to Agrarian Law,' and the 'Decline and Fall of
   the English System of Finance.' The first of these is a continuation of
   the arguments advanced in the 'Bights of Man;' the second is a plan for
   creating in every country a national fund 'to pay to every person when
   arrived at the age of twenty-one years the sum of fifteen pounds sterling,
   to enable him or her to begin the world, and also ten pounds sterling, per
   annum, during life, to every person, now living, of the age of fifty
   years, and to all others, when they shall arrive at that age, to enable
   them to live in old age without wretchedness, and to go decently out of
   the world.'

   This little essay contains a good deal of original thinking, and close
   reasoning, though in the present state of society it is not very probable
   that its recommendations will be ever adopted. The pamphlet on finance is
   a proof of Mr. Paine's extensive knowledge on this complicated subject.
   The events of every day serve to confirm the truth of his opinions
   respecting the English system, and the agitations which have prevailed
   throughout the country rendered the fulfilment of his predictions
   exceedingly probable.

   In 1796, he published at Paris a 'Letter to General Washington.' The
   principal subject of this letter is the treaty which had recently been
   concluded between the United States and Great Britain. From the articles
   of the treaty, Mr. Paine contends, that those, who concluded it had
   compromised the honor of America, and the safety of her commerce, from a
   disposition to crouch to the British minister. The cold neglect of Mr.
   Washington toward Mr. Paine during his imprisonment, forms likewise a
   prominent subject of the letter and but for this circumstance it is
   probable it would never have appeared. Notwithstanding the high opinion
   which Mr. Washington professed to entertain of his services in behalf of
   American independence, he abandoned him in a few years afterward to the
   mercy of Robespierre, and during his imprisonment of eleven months he
   never made a single effort to reclaim him. This was not the treatment
   which the author of ' Common Sense' deserved at the hands of Mr.
   Washington, either as a private individual, or as president of America.
   Exclusive of Mr. Paine's being a citizen of the United States, and of his
   being consequently entitled to the protection of the government, he had
   rendered America services which none but the ungrateful could forget; he
   had therefore no reason to expect that her chief magistrate would abandon
   him in the hour of difficulty. However deserving of our admiration some
   parts of General Washington's conduct may be, his behavior in this
   instance certainly reflects no honor upon his character.

   From a variety of circumstances it appears that Mr. Paine regarded the
   United States as the land of his home. His spirit of universal
   philanthropy, his republican principles, and his resolution in attacking
   fraud and superstition, whether in politics Or religion, rendered him in a
   great measure an inhabitant of the world, more than of any particular
   country; but notwithstanding these peculiarities of disposition, he had
   domestic feelings and local attachments which neither time nor distance
   could obliterate. During his residence in Europe, he always declared his
   intention of returning to America: the following extract from a letter of
   his to a female literary correspondent at New York, will show the
   affectionate regard which he constantly cherished for the safety and
   freedom of the country-whose affairs were the means of first launching him
   into public life:- ,

   'You touch me on a very tender point, when you say, that my friends on
   your side of the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of my abandoning
   America, even for my native England. They are right. I had rather see my
   horse, Button, eating the grass of Bordentown, or Morrissania, than see
   all the pomp and' show of Europe.

   A thousand years hence, for I must indulge a few thoughts, perhaps in
   less, America may be what England now is. The innocence of her character,
   that won the hearts of all nations in her favor, may sound like a romance,
   and her inimitable virtue as if it had never been. The ruins of that
   liberty, which thousands bled to obtain, may just furnish materials for a
   village tale, or extort a sigh from rustic sensibility; while the
   fashionable of that day, enveloped in dissipation shall deride the
   principle and deny the fact.

   When we contemplate the fall of empires, and the extinction of the nations
   of the ancient world, we see but little more to excite our regret than the
   mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty
   pyramids, and walls and towers of the most costly workmanship: but when
   the empire of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow
   will be infinitely greater than crumbling brass or marble can inspire. It
   will not then be said, Here stood a temple of vast antiquity, here rose a
   Babel of invisible height, or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance;
   but here, ah! painful thought! the noblest work of human wisdom, the
   greatest scene of human glory, the fair cause of freedom, rose and fell!
   Read this, then ask if I forgot America.'

   The name of the lady to whom the above was addressed, was Nicholson. She
   was afterward married to Colonel Few. Whether or not it was owing to Mr.
   Paine's opinions on religion I do not know, but on his return to America
   he was totally forsaken by her and her husband. When, however, Mr. Paine's
   dissolution was at hand, they sought his company, and Mrs. Few expressed a
   wish to renew their former friendship. But Mr. Paine, weak and debilitated
   as he was, refused to shake hands with her, and indignantly observed, 'You
   have neglected me, and I beg you will leave the room.'

   In 1797, a society was formed of a number of persons in Paris, under the
   title of 'Theophilanthropists.' Of this society Paine was one of the
   principal promoters. Their objects were the propagation of morality and
   extinction of religious prejudices, and their faith the belief of one God:
   At one of their meetings Mr. Paine delivered a public discourse, in which
   he stated his reasons for rejecting the doctrines of atheism, which at
   that time prevailed in many parts of France.

   This year he likewise published a 'Letter to the People of France, on the
   Events of the eighteenth Fructidor.' Of the merits or demerits of this
   pamphlet, I am unable to say anything as I have not been able to procure a
   copy. I believe it was never reprinted.

   About the middle of the same year he also addressed a letter to Camille
   Jordan, one of the council of five hundred, respecting his report on the
   priests, public worship, and bells. I have only seen a mutilated copy of
   this production, but as far as I can judge from that, it deserves to be
   classed with the best works of the author. 'It is want of feeling,' says
   he, 'to talk of priests and bells, while so many infants are perishing in
   the hospitals, and aged and infirm poor in the streets from the want of
   necessaries. The abundance that France produces is sufficient for every
   want, if rightly applied; but priests and bells, like articles of luxury,
   ought to be the least articles of consideration.'

   The publication of his deistical opinions certainly lost our author a
   great number of friends, and, it is possible, that this might be one of
   the causes of General Washington's indifference. The clear, open, and
   undisguised method in which he had contested established opinions, called
   forth the united indignation of the whole order of priesthood in England
   and America, and there was scarcely a house of devotion, in the old world
   or the new, which did not resound with their pious execrations. They
   witnessed with amazement and terror the immense circulation of the work,
   and they trembled at the possibility that men might assume sufficient
   courage to think for themselves. Thousands of persons who had never seen
   the book, and who knew nothing of its contents, except through the
   perverted medium of their spiritual teachers, rent the air with
   exclamations against the blasphemies of Thomas Paine, and to conclude
   these truly charitable proceedings, the English government called upon the
   public to condemn the work which they had suppressed by a legal
   prosecution.

   Such are the means adopted by the professors of Christianity to suffocate
   inquiry, and to dispel the doubts of skepticism.

   To the credit of mankind it ought to be observed, that the powers of the
   hierarchy are upon the decline. There was a time when Mr. Paine would have
   been roasted alive for daring to dispute the dogmas of the church, but the
   progress of science, , and its handmaid, civilization, has softened the
   ferocity of human nature, and a somewhat milder punishment is now reserved
   for those who may question the divinity of the Christian religion. For
   this, however, we are not indebted either to the morality of the religion,
   or the piety of its professors- we owe it to the progress which mankind
   have made in freeing themselves from the profane and barbarous notions
   which such a system of belief is calculated to diffuse wherever it is
   tolerated."

   Mr. Paine, it appears, lived long enough in France to become unpopular, at
   least for a time. His opposition to the dominant party of Robespiere, and
   to the death of the king of France, were the political offences which
   rendered him so. While his "Age of Reason," written in defence of deism,
   and for the express purpose of arresting the progress of atheism, as he
   himself informs us, still farther contributed to his unpopularity, for
   atheism and violence, although not necessarily connected, at one time
   prevailed; and during the reign of terror, and even after the death of
   Robespiere, men who were not of his party, nor intolerant democrats,
   assumed to be so, to avoid suspicion and death by the guillotine: these
   therefore dared not associate with Mr. Paine, who steadfastly adhered to
   his republican principles without cringing to an intolerant party. When
   Mr. Paine became unpopular he lived chiefly in retirement; and, though a
   member of the national assembly, he did not make himself prominent, as he
   could not sanction their proceedings, and opposition was useless,
   especially, as he did not speak the language fluently, and never in
   public. While Mr. Paine was unpopular in France, and when he had but few
   friends, he resided chiefly with Mr. Bonneville and family. Mr. Bonneville
   at that time edited a paper, was in good circumstances, and when Mr.
   Paine's remittances from this country were not regular, he cheerfully lent
   him money. This kindness, on the part of Bonneville, shown at a time when
   Mr. Paine most needed it, was not lost on him, for he was as grateful as
   generous, moral qualities always in the same ratio; and Mr. Paine had
   afterward an opportunity of returning this kindness; for, on the elevation
   of Bonaparte to supreme power, the press of Mr. Bonneville was stopped,
   and himself injured in his property. At this time Mr. Paine resolved to
   quit France, where liberty appeared hopelessly absorbed by the splendid
   military talents and achievements of Napoleon. Mr. Paine then offered an
   asylum to Mr. Bonneville and family in the United States, and this offer
   Mr. Bonneville accepted, and soon after Mr. Paine returned to this
   country. In 1802 Mr. Bonneville forwarded his wife and three sons,
   intending to follow them as soon as he could settle his affairs. Accident
   or change of purpose delayed his arrival till after Mr. Paine's death, and
   hence he became charged with the maintenance of Mrs. Bonneville and family
   (except the elder son, who returned to his father) till his death. To this
   subject we shall again refer in the fourth part of this life, especially
   as it afforded Cheetham the subject of a libel, of which he was convicted,
   after the death of Mr., Paine.

   The social and moral character of Mr. Paine while in France appears to
   have been the same as in England, and as in this country during the
   revolution; yet Sherwin, in his life, seems to admit that at one period,
   when unpopular,, he became intemperate. Joel Barlow, who certainly knew
   him well, partially admits the charge while he vindicates the general
   character of Mr. Paine, in a letter to Cheetham, which we shall extract.
   In spite of these admissions, and others, with various allusions from
   persons who knew something of him, we are sceptica'l of the fact, because
   we were nearly betrayed into an error on this subject, in relation to his
   course of life after his return to this country. 'The statement that Mr.
   Paine was intemperate was so commonly asserted, that we never contemplated
   looking for proof to the contrary, till this fact was forced upon us by
   the uniform testimony of his most intimate acquaintances; but as" this
   subject relates to the fourth part of his history, we shall reserve, it
   for its proper place. "We introduced it merely to justify our scepticism-
   in relation to his habits in France, when partially in seclusion. This
   doubt in us does not arise from any desire to screen Mr. Paine from any
   supposed blemish; for, if this were the fact, we feel more disposed to
   justify than to screen him. We know that he was not only temperate in
   after life, but even abstemious; and he would therefore stand as a
   monument of reform in old age, on a subject where reform is most uncommon
   at that period. Mr. Paine lived in an age when hospitality and excess were
   so identified that the one could not be shown without the other. In our
   boyish days bumpers were drank in good society, on public occasions; the
   toasts must go round, and the glasses drained in honor to the toast, and
   occasional excess, even when no public cause induced it, was only a proof
   of good fellowship. Nor would the host be satisfied that the guests had
   done him honor, if noisy mirth, excited by wine, did not finish the
   repast; while the guest did not scruple, on his next-day visit, to
   complain of present headache, and of double sight, and a staggering gait
   on the previous evening, as proofs of his good entertainment, and of the
   liberality of his friend and host. At that time Pitt was a four-bottle
   man, Fox, when in exertion, would drink wine from a great bowl, and the
   heir apparent to the British crown might ever go to greater excesses,
   surrounded by the brilliants of the nation; among whom Sheridan and Fox
   were not the least distinguished. If Mr. Paine, then, the companion, of
   some of these men, had done as they did, he would only have been on a
   level with them, and to the custom of the times must the folly be
   ascribed. Since that age the custom has changed, bumpers are not insisted
   on in good society,' except in song. A drained glass is not a sine que
   non. The host indeed spreads the table abundantly, but excess is not the
   fashion; each helps himself, and the flow of reason and wit, and innocent
   games, supply the place of boisterous mirth. The change is rational, but
   the present age must not condemn the past, for all follow custom. We feel
   then no disposition to screen Mr. Paine, but so many falsehoods have been
   told on this subject, that we honestly doubt various assertions
   unsupported by facts. Mr. Clio Rickman followed Mr. Paine to France,
   became again his companion, and parted with him on the shore when he
   finally left that country for this. We shall give that gentleman's account
   of Mr. Paine's habits in France, as far as he knew.

   "Mr. Paine was acknowledged deputy for Calais, the 21st of September,
   1792. In France, during the early part of the revolution, his time was
   almost wholly occupied as a deputy of the convention and as a member of
   the committee of constitution. His company was now coveted and sought
   after universally among every description of people, and by many who for
   some reasons never chose to avow it. With the Earl of Lauderdale, and Dr.
   Moore, whose company he was fond of, he dined every Friday, till Lord
   Gower's departure made it necessary for them to quit France, which was
   early in 1793.

   About this period he removed from White's hotel to one near the Rue de
   Richelieu, where he was so plagued and interrupted by numerous visitors,
   and sometimes by adventurers, that in order to have some time to himself
   he appropriated two mornings in a week for his levee days. To this indeed
   he was extremely averse, from the fuss and formality attending it, but' he
   was nevertheless obliged to adopt it.

   Annoyed and disconcerted with a life so contrary to his wishes and habits,
   and so inimical to his views, he retired to the Fauxbourg St. Dennis,
   where he occupied part of the hotel that Madame de Pompadour once resided
   in.

   Here was a good garden well laid out, and here too our mutual friend Mr.
   Choppin occupied apartments; at this residence, which for a town one was
   very quiet, he lived a life of retirement and philosophical ease, while it
   was believed he was gone into the country for his health, which by this
   time indeed was much impaired by intense application to business, and by
   the anxious solicitude he felt for the welfare of public affairs.

   Here with a chosen few he unbent himself; among whom were Brissot, the
   Marquis de Chatelet le Roi of the gallerie de honore, and an old friend of
   Dr. Franklin, Bangal, and sometimes General Miranda. His English
   associates were Christie and family, Mary Wollstonecraft, Mr. and Mrs.
   Stone, &c. Among his American friends were Capt. Imlay, Joel Barlow, &c.,
   &c. To these parties the French inmates were generally invited.

   It was about this time a gentleman at Paris thus writes of him to his
   friend: 'An English lady of our acquaintance, not less remarkable for her
   talents than for her elegance of manners, entreated me to contrive that
   she might have an interview with Mr. Paine. In consequence of this I
   invited him to dinner on a day when we were to be favored with her
   company. For above four hours he kept every one in astonishment and
   admiration of his memory, his keen observation of men and manners, his
   numberless anecdotes of the American Indians, of the American war, of
   Franklin, Washington, and even of his majesty, of whom he told several
   curious facts of humor and benevolence. His remarks on genius and taste
   can never be forgotten by those present.'"

   The above extract is a part of Mr. Yorke's letter, published we believe in
   this country, but as that letter contains some falsehoods we have no
   confidence in it; for Mr. Yorke says Paine could repeat by heart anything
   he had written: and Sherwin repeats the statement. This is a mistake, as
   we are informed by Mr. John Fellows and others, his intimates. Mr. Paine
   would necessarily express himself nearly in the same style, on the same
   subject, because it was the most clear, the fewest words, and combined the
   greatest strength. Men who say the best thing first, can but repeat them
   on a future occasion. Mr. Clio Rickman goes on to remark:-

   "He usually rose about seven, breakfasted with his friend Choppin,
   Johnson, and two or three other Englishmen, and a Monsieur La Borde, -who
   had been an officer in the cidevant garde du corps, an intolerable
   aristocrat, but whose skill in mechanics and geometry brought on a
   friendship between him and Paine; for the undaunted and distinguished
   ability and firmness with which he ever defended his own opinions when
   controverted, do not reflect higher honor upon him than that unbounded
   liberality toward the opinions of others which constituted such a
   prominent feature in his character, and which never suffered mere
   difference of sentiment, whether political or religious, to interrupt the
   harmonious intercourse of friendship, or impede the interchanges of
   knowledge and information.

   After breakfast he usually strayed an hour or two in the garden, where he
   one morning pointed out the kind of spider whose web furnished him with
   the first idea of constructing his iron bridge; a fine model of which, in
   mahogany, is preserved at Paris.

   The little happy circle who lived with him here will ever remember these
   days with delight: with these select friends he would talk of his boyish
   days, play at chess, whist, piquet, or cribbage, and enliven the moments
   by many interesting anecdotes: with these he would sport on the broad and
   fine gravel walk at the upper end of the garden, and then retire to his
   boudoir, where he was up to his knees in letters and papers of various
   descriptions. Here he remained till dinner-time; and unless he visited
   Brissot's family, or some particular friend in the evening, which was his
   frequent custom, he joined again the society of his favorites and
   fellow-boarders, with whom his conversation was often witty and cheerful,
   always acute and improving, but never frivolous.

   Incorrupt, straightforward, and sincere, he pursued his political course
   in France, as everywhere else, let the government or clamor or faction of
   the day be what it might, with firmness, with clearness, and without a
   shadow of turning.'

   In all Mr. Paine's inquiries and conversations he evinced the strongest
   attachment to the investigation of truth, and was always for going to the
   fountain-head for information. He often lamented we had no good history of
   America, and that the letters written by Columbus, the early navigators,
   and others, to the Spanish court, were inaccessible, and that many
   valuable documents, collected by Philip II, and deposited with the
   national archives at Simania, had not yet been promulgated. He used to
   speak highly of the sentimental parts of Raynal's History."

   As farther illustration of the character of Mr. Paine while in France we
   shall now introduce the letter of Joel Barlow to Cheetham, when Cheetham
   was getting up the life of Paine, just after the death of the latter. He
   wrote for in information to various persons, suggesting what answers they
   should give by leading questions. These answers, if they suited his
   purpose, lie published, if not, he suppressed them or he took the liberty
   of publishing detached parts of what he had been told, or related direct
   falsehoods, as in the case of Mr. Jarvis, who has explicitly denied to us
   the words which Cheetham puts into his mouth in relation to Mr. Paine.
   Cheetham, among others, wrote to Mr. Barlow, and to him put such sort of
   questions as we have noticed. Mr. Barlow, in reply, states as follows:-

                               TO JAMES CHEETHAM.

   "Sir: I have received your letter calling for information relative to the
   life of Thomas Paine. It appears to me that this is not the moment to
   publish the life of that man in this country. His own writings are his
   best life, and these are not read at present.

   The greatest part of the readers in the United States will not be
   persuaded as long as their present feelings last, to consider him in any
   other light than as a drunkard and a deist. The writer of his life who
   should dwell on these topics, to the exclusion of the great and estimable
   traits of his real character, might, indeed, please the rabble of the age
   who do not know him,; the book might sell; but it would only tend to
   render the truth more obscure, for the future biographer than it was
   before. ''

   But if the present writer should give us Thomas Paine complete in all his
   character as one of the most benevolent and disinterested of mankind,
   endowed with the clearest perception, an uncommon share of original
   genius, and the greatest breadth of thought; if this piece of biography
   should analyze his literary labors, and rank him as he ought to be ranked
   among the brightest and most undeviating luminaries of the age in which he
   has lived-yet with a mind assailable by flattery, and receiving through
   that weak side a tincture of vanity which he was too proud to conceal;
   with a. mind, though strong enough to bear him up, and to rise elastic
   under the heaviest load of oppression, yet unable to endure the contempt
   of his former friends and fellow-laborers, the rulers of the country that
   had received his first and greatest services- a mind incapable of looking
   down with serene compassion, as it ought, on the rude scoffs of their
   imitators, a new generation that knows him not; a mind that shrinks from
   their, society, and unhappily seeks refuge in low company, or looks for
   consolation in the sordid, solitary bottle, till it sinks at last so far
   below its native elevation as to lose all respect for itself, and to
   forfeit that of his best friends, disposing these friends almost to join
   with his enemies, and wish, though from different motives, that he would
   haste to hide himself in the grave-if you are disposed and prepared to
   write his life, thus entire, to fill up the picture to which these hasty
   strokes of outline give but a rude sketch with great vacuities, your book
   may be a useful one for another age, but it will not be relished, nor
   scarcely tolerated in this.

   The biographer of Thomas Paine should not forget his mathematical
   acquirements, and his mechanical genius. His invention of the iron bridge,
   which led him to Europe in the. year 1787, has procured him a great
   reputation in that branch of science, in France and England, in both which
   countries his bridge has been adopted in many instances^ and is now much
   in use.

   You ask whether he took an oath of allegiance to France. Doubtless, the
   qualification to be a member of the convention required an oath of
   fidelity to that country, but involved in it no abjuration of his fidelity
   to this. He was made a French citizen by the same decree with Washington,
   Hamilton, Priestley, and Sir James Mackintosh.

   What Mr. M has told you relative to the circumstances of his arrestation
   by order of Robespierre, is erroneous, at least in one point. Paine did
   not lodge at the house where he was arrested, but had been dining there
   with some Americans, of whom Mr. -M- may have been one. I never heard
   before, that Paine was intoxicated that night. Indeed the officers brought
   him directly to my house, which was two miles from his lodgings, and about
   as much from the place where he had been dining. He was not intoxicated
   when they came to me. Their object was to get me to go and assist them to
   examine Paine's papers. It employed us the rest of that night, and the
   whole of the next day at Paine's lodgings; and he was not committed to
   prison till the next evening.

   You ask what company he kept-he always frequented the best, both in
   England and France, till he became the object of calumny in certain
   American papers (echoes of the English court papers), for his adherence to
   what he thought the cause of liberty in France, till he conceived himself
   neglected and despised by his former friends in the United States! From
   that moment he gave himself very much to drink, and, consequently, to
   companions less worthy of his better days.

   It is said he was always a peevish inmate-this is possible. So was
   Lawrence Sterne, so was Torquato Tasso, so was J. J. Rousseau; but Thomas
   Paine, as a visiting acquaintance and as a literary friend, the only
   points of view in which I knew him, was one of the most instructive men I
   ever have known. He had a surprising memory and brilliant fancy; his mind
   was a storehouse of facts and useful observations; he was full of lively
   anecdote, and ingenious original, pertinent remark upon almost every
   subject.

   He was always charitable to the poor beyond his means, a sure protector
   and friend to all Americans in distress that he found in foreign
   countries. And he had frequent occasions to exert his influence in
   protecting them during the revolution in France. His writings will answer
   for his patriotism, and his entire devotion to what he conceived to be the
   best interest and happiness of mankind.

   This, sir, is all I have to remark on the subject you mention. Now I have
   only one request to make, and that would doubtless seem impertinent, were
   you not the editor of a newspaper; it is, that you will not publish my
   letter, nor permit a copy of it to be taken.

   I am, sir, &c.,

                                                                 Joel Barlow.

   Kalorama, August II, 1809."

   Mr. Barlow was not always so candid. He has published a poem on the
   revolution, in which he does not mention Mr. Paine, whose "Common Sense"
   produced the declaration of independence, and who, throughout the contest,
   did more toward producing unanimity and funds (the two essentials in war)
   than any other man. We have now in our house a compact history of the
   revolution, by S. F. Wilson, published in Baltimore, in which the same
   injustice is done to Mr. Paine, for he scarcely occupies one line in the
   history, although "political writings" without giving a name, are referred
   to, as being very efficacious. Paul Allen in a larger work does him the
   same injustice. In a biography of distinguished American characters, by
   Colonel Knapp, published by Conner, a short notice was inserted of Mr.
   Paine, being a republication of an English biography. This Mr. Conner was
   obliged to alter, after stereotyping, at the instigation of Collins and
   Hanna, and other booksellers, not because the facts and sentiments were
   incorrect, but because the praise of Mr. Paine would spoil the sale of the
   book. These facts we learn from Mr. John Fellows and Mr. Conner. In the
   case of Joel Barlow there was no personal objection, but he knew that
   prejudices existed against Mr. Paine, and he succumbed to public feeling;
   and such we believe the case with other writers.

   While Mr. Paine was in France, and partly detached from politics, in
   consequence of imprisonment and the violence of party, he was not idle.
   Mr. Yorke remarks, in his letter published in Sherwin's Life:- o

   "In showing me one day the beautiful models of two bridges he had devised,
   he observed that Dr. Franklin once told him, that ' books are written to
   please, houses built for great men, churches for priests, but no bridge
   for the people.'

   These models exhibit an extraordinary degree, not only of skill, but of
   taste, in mechanics; and are wrought with extreme delicacy, entirely by
   his own hands. The largest is nearly four feet in length; the iron works,
   the chains, and every other article belonging to it, were forged and
   manufactured by himself. It is intended as the model of a bridge, which is
   to be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet with only one
   arch. The other is to be erected over a lesser river, whose name I forget,
   and is likewise a single arch, and of his own workmanship, excepting the
   chains, which instead of iron, are cut out of pasteboard, by the fair hand
   of his correspondent, the 'Little Corner of the World,' whose
   indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary. He was offered three thousand
   pounds for these models, and refused it. The iron bars, which I before
   mentioned that I noticed in a corner of his room, were also forged by
   himself, as the model of a crane, of a new description. He put them
   together, and exhibited the power of the lever, to a most surprising
   degree."

   "Mr. Yorke in the above extract states the correspondence between Lady
   Smith and Mr. Paine to have been extremely beautiful and interesting; as a
   pr6of of this, the following specimen is subjoined:-

   'FROM "THE CASTLE IN AIR," TO THE' LITTLE CORNER OF TIIE WORLD."

   In the region of clouds where the whirlwinds arise,
     My castle of fancy was built;
   The turrets reflected the blue of the skies,

     And the windows with sun-beams were gilt.

    

   The rainbow sometimes, in its beautiful slate,

     Enamelled the mansion around,
   And, the figures that fancy in clouds can create,

     Supplied me with gardens and ground.

   I had grottoes and fountains and orange tree groves,

     I had all that enchantment has told;
   I had sweet shady walks for the gods and their loves,

     I had mountains of coral and gold.

   But a storm that I frit, not, had risen and rolled,

     While wrapt in a slumber I lay:
   And when I looked out in the morning, behold! J

     My castle was carried away.

   It passed over rivers, and valleys, and groves-

     The world, it was all in my view-
   I thought of my friends, of their fates, of their loves,
     And often, full often, of you.

   At length it came over a beautiful scene,'

   That stature in silence had made:
   ; The place was but small-but was sweetly serene,
   And chequered with sunshine and shade.

   I gazed and I envied with painfnl good will,

     And grew tired of my seal in the air:
   When all of a sudden my castle stood still. ,

   As if some attraction was there.

   Like a lark from the sky it came fluttering down,

     And placed me exactly in view-
   When who should I meet, in this charming retreat,

     This corner of calmness-but you.

   Delighted to find you in honor and ease,

   I felt no more sorrow nor pain;

   And the wind coming fair, I ascended the breeze, ,

   And went back with my castle again.'

   The above was written during his residence in Paris. Mr. Paine had very
   early in life corresponded with the lady to whom it was addressed, his
   letters, like the foregoing, being dated from the 'Castle in the Air,' and
   hers from the 'Little Corner of the World.' For reasons which he knew not,
   their intercourse was suddenly suspended, and for some time he believed
   his friend in obscurity and distress. Many years afterward, he met her
   unexpectedly at Paris, in the most affluent circumstances, and married to
   Sir Robert Smith.

   In Mr. Yorke's Letters there is another piece, on forgetfulness. This is
   replete with the most beautiful imagery, but Mr. Yorke, from some motive
   which I cannot discover, has cancelled so great a part of it, that much of
   the interest is lost which it would otherwise possess.

   As the letter of Mr. Jefferson which Mr. Yorke alludes to, shows the high
   opinion which that gentleman entertained of our author's services, and his
   wish to accommodate him by every possible kindness, I here subjoin a copy
   of it:-.

   'You express a wish in your letter to return to America by a national
   ship; Mr. Dawson, who brings over the treaty, and who will present you
   with this letter, is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland to
   receive and accommodate you back, if you can be ready to depart at such a
   short warning. You will in general find us returned to sentiments worthy
   of former times; in these it will be your glory to have steadily labored,
   and with as much effect as any man living. That you may live long to
   continue your useful labors, and reap the reward in the thankfulness of
   nations, is my sincere prayer. Accept the assurances of my high esteem,
   and affectionate attachment.

                                                           Thomas Jefferson.'

   Soon after Mr. Paine's release from the Luxembourg, it appears he made an
   effort to return to America, but he found the obstacles more numerous than
   he expected. The misconduct of Mr. Monroe's predecessor had rendered his
   reception in France a very unpleasant one, and as soon as he had effected
   a good understanding with the government of tHat country, he wished to
   transmit some despatches to America, by a person with whom he could
   likewise confide a verbal communication, and he fixed upon Mr. Paine. For
   this purpose he applied to the committee of public safety for a passport,
   but as Mr. Paine had been voted again into the convention, it was only the
   convention who could grant the passport, and as an application to them
   would have made his departure publicly known, he was obliged to sustain
   the disappointment, and Mr. Monroe to lose the opportunity.

   When Mr. Monroe left France, our author was to have accompanied him, but
   owing to some unforeseen circumstances he was unable to complete his
   arrangements for that purpose. It was fortunate he could not, for the
   vessel in which the minister returned was boarded by a British frigate in
   her passage, and every part of her searched, down even to the hold, for
   Thomas Paine. He then went to Havre, thinking that he should be able to
   embark there without its being known, but he found that several British
   frigates were cruising in sight 'of the port, and he thereupon returned to
   Paris. Seeing himself cut off from every opportunity that was within his
   power to command, he wrote to Mr., Jefferson requesting that if the fate
   of the election should put him in the chair of the presidency, and he
   should have occasion to send a frigate to France, he would give him the
   opportunity of returning by it. This application produced an answer from
   Mr. Jefferson of which the letter before cited is a copy. He did not,
   however, go by this vessel, the notice being too short. He next agreed to
   embark with Commodore Barney, in a vessel he had engaged, but #this, as in
   some of the former cases, the protecting hand of Providence was very
   visible, he was accidently detained beyond the time, and the vessel sunk
   at sea. Such a multitude of difficulties and narrow escapes were perhaps
   never concentrated together in the execution of so simple a project. He
   finally embarked from Havre on the 1st of September, and arrived at
   Baltimore on the 30th of October, 1802."

    

                                    PART IV.

   FROM THE ARRIVAL OF MR. PAINE IN BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 30, 1802 TO HIS DEATH
   IN 1809

   The most interesting period of Mr. Paine's life has necessarily already
   been given. He was now an old man, between sixty and seventy, yet
   vigorous, with his mental faculties unimpaired. His strong desire to end
   his days in the United States was beautifully and pathetically expressed
   to a lady, in a letter from France, a few days before his arrival. This we
   have already given. The reception of Mr. Paine in the United States was
   such as might have been expected' from his fame and independent course. In
   a letter to his friend Clio Rickman he thus expresses himself:-

   "my Dear Friend: Mr. Monroe, who is appointed minister extraordinary to
   prance, takes charge of this, to be delivered to Mr. Este, banker in
   Paris,' to be forwarded to you.

   I arrived at Baltimore 30th October, and ,you can have no idea of the
   agitation which my arrival occasioned. From New Hampshire to Georgia (an
   extent of 1500 miles), every newspaper was filled with applause or abuse.

   My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and is
   now worth six thousand pounds sterling;- which put in the funds will bring
   me .-L-400 sterling a year.

   Remember me in friendship and affection to your wife and family, and in
   the circle of our friends.

   Yours in friendship,

                                                               Thomas Paine."

   What course he meant to pursue in America his own words will best tell,
   and best characterize his sentiments and principles; they are these:-

   "As this letter is intended to announce my arrival to my friends, and my
   enemies if I have any, for I ought to have none in America, and as
   introductory to others that will occasionally follow, I shall close it by
   detailing the line of conduct I shall pursue.

   I have no occasion to ask, nor do I intend to accept, any place or office
   in the government.

   There is none it could give me that would in any way be equal to the
   profits I could, make as an author (for I have an established fame in the
   literary world) could I reconcile it to my principles to make money by my
   politics or religion; I must be in everything as I have ever been, a
   disinterested volunteer: my proper sphere of action is on the common floor
   of citizenship, and to honest men I give my hand and my-heart freely.

   I have some manuscript works to publish, of which I shall give proper
   notice, and some mechanical affairs to bring forward, that' will employ
   all my leisure time.

   I shall continue these letters as I see occasion, and as to the low party
   prints that choose to abuse me, they are welcome: I shall not descend to
   answer them. I have been too much used to such common stuff to take any
   notice of it.

                                                                Thomas Paine.

   City Of WasiiingtoN." ^

   Mr. Paine did not remain long at Baltimore, but while there the following
   characteristic circumstance occurred:-

   "Passing through Baltimore, he was accosted by the Rev. Mr. Hargrove,
   minister of a new sect, called the New Jerusalemites. 'You are Mr. Paine,'
   said Mr. Hargrove. . 'Yes.' 'My name is Hargrove, sir; I am minister of
   the New Jerusalem church here. We, sir, explain the Scripture in its true
   meaning. The key has been lost above four thousand years, and we have
   found it.' 'Then,' said Paine, drily, 'it must have been very rusty.'

   Mr. Paine visited Washington, and was kindly received by Jefferson, then
   president; indeed this gentleman kept up a constant correspondence with
   him to the day of his death. He had invited him to return to the United
   States, had sent out a ship for him, and on being asked if he had done so,
   he replied, "I have, and when he arrives, if there be an office in my
   gift, suitable for him to fill, I will give it to him; I will never
   abandon old friends to make room for new ones." Mr. Paine, it appears, had
   resolved not to take office, his wants were moderate and his means
   sufficient. Mr. Paine visited the heads of the departments, and the
   various leading political characters, by whom he was received with
   pleasure, and remembered with gratitude, not, however, to be depended on
   when such remembrances came in contact with their popularity.

   Soon after Mr. Paine came to New York, and put up at the City hotel, then
   Lovett's hotel, where Grant Thorburn, well known in New York, says, in
   a-pamphlet before noticed, that he visited him, introduced himself, shook
   hands with him, declared that his only object in thus visiting Mr. Paine
   was to see the man who had written "Common Sense," and was so much talked
   about; and having gratified his curiosity, as he says,

   -he abruptly retired, to the no small amusement of the party. Thorburn had
   formerly adopted Mr. Paine's principles, but at this time he was a
   professor of religion, and held some office in a baptist church, the
   members of which, hearing that Mr. Grant Thorburn had shaken hands with
   Thomas Paine, thought proper to suspend him from the church on that
   account; for this reason we have introduced the anecdote, as it explains
   the situation of all the friends of Mr. Paine, who were connected with
   churches, either from principle or policy.

   'While Mr. Paine was at Lovett's hotel, in spite of the influence of the
   church, he was honored with a public dinner by a respectable and numerous
   party, and his after-enemy, Cheetham, then editor of a daily paper, the
   Organ of the democratic party, was particularly active in making the
   arrangements. Notwithstanding this public declaration in favor of Mr.
   Paine, he was not popular; the church feared him and had set their curse
   upon him; children had been taught to lisp his name in connexion with
   blasphemy; and those political leaders who sought after place, without
   regarding the means to be employed, and who needed the suffrages of the
   pious, and above all feared their united opposition, shunned the company
   of Mr. Paine as something contaminating. The people were deceived by the
   church, and those who knew better wanted the honesty to stem the torrent.
   Jefferson, Clinton, the, mayor of New York, and a number of others, which
   in politics, literature, and situation in life, were honorable exceptions;
   while the independence of Mr. Paine would not allow him to conceal his
   principles or conform in practices which involved even a portion of
   hypocrisy. On a morning visit to Dr. Mitchill, in company with Mr. John
   Fellows, the latter reminded Mr. Paine, while in a gig, before they
   reached the doctor, .that Mr. Paine had a morning gown on; Mr. Paine
   replied, "Let these dress who need it." Cheetham has said much about the
   slovenly habits and appearance of Mr. Paine. Mr. Fellows, who knew him
   well from his first return to this country till his death, denies the
   whole of it. He remarks that he was careless of his appearance (as the
   above little anecdote shows), but always cleanly and decent; and, as we
   before remarked, that he never saw him disguised in liquor but once, when
   he had been to a dinner-party, and that he was then only excited. This
   opinion we find uniformly supported by every credible person who knew him.

   The partial desertion of Mr. Paine, as a matter of policy, by many of the
   prominent leading political characters, opened a way to others of less
   influence in society, but more fearless of public opinion; and some of
   these, with an indiscreet zeal, thrust themselves upon Mr. Paine, and
   claimed a sort of championship in his support. At this time Mr. Carver
   introduced himself to Mr. Paine, as a fellow-townsman, who, when a boy,
   remembered the fame of the latter, at Lewes, in Sussex. Mr. Paine, too,
   probably, remembered him, for Carver had sometimes saddled his horse, and
   could remind him of these services and former times. Mr. Carver was at
   this period a respectable tradesman, a blacksmith and veterinary surgeon.
   He had a comfortable home, was liberal, and kept a horse and chaise; but,
   above all, he was honest, independent, and openly avowed the opinions,
   political and theological, of Mr. Paine. With him Mr. Paine consented to
   live till he went to his farm at New Rochelle; and thus he became a guest,
   and afterward a boarder and lodger of a man who, without meaning it, did
   his memory a great injustice, by becoming the tool of Cheetham in a fit of
   anger.

   Mrs. Bonneville and her three sons soon after arrived from France, on
   invitation from Mr. Paine to Mr. Bonneville and the whole family, as
   mentioned in the introduction to this life. Mr. Paine, who was simple in
   his habits, indeed economical, offered Mrs. Bonneville his small farm at
   Bordentown, where he wished to establish her in a school; but this
   employment did not suit the habits or taste of this lady, and thus the
   expense of herself and family fell entirely on Mr. Paine. He retired to
   New Rochelle, and boarded with Purdy, who lived on Paine's farm. Madam
   Bonneville, however, preferred New York, where she occasionally taught
   French, while the two boys were sent to school at New Rochelle by Mr.
   Paine; the eldest, a youth of fourteen, returned to France. Mr. Paine was
   godfather to one of the others, who had been named after him. He now
   divided his time between New York and New Rochelle, boarding in various
   places, and sometimes living on his farm.

   Cheetham has represented Mr. Paine at this period, as disgustingly dirty,
   drunken, ill-tempered, and quarrelsome, and with much impudence he has
   referred to living characters as proofs, and thus he gives to his
   falsehoods the appearance of truth; while a portion of the clergy, eager
   to believe what they wished to be true, have propagated these falsehoods
   with the utmost zeal. We are, however, fortunate in being acquainted with
   those who were about him at this time, and with some of those to whom
   Cheetham refers; and these latter do not hesitate to blast the memory of
   this writer of Paine's life as a deliberate falsifier, and as an
   unprincipled man. Both Carver and Mr. Jarvis, the celebrated painter, thus
   speak of Cheetham, and yet he has had the impudence to refer to them for
   events as facts which he knew to be fabricated. At this time, 1803 and
   1804, when Mr. Paine was backward and forward, from New York to New
   Rochelle, he resided for several weeks at the private house of Captain
   Pelton, who also kept the store at New Rochelle. He resided also for two
   months in the winter with Mr. Staple, at New Rochelle. Mr. D. Burger, the
   brother-in-law of Mr. Staple, was the clerk to Captain Pelton, and when
   Mr. Paine was rather poorly, he drove him in a gig daily about the
   neighborhood. He, too, supplied Mr. Paine with all the liquor he took,
   which was one quart of rum in a week, to serve himself and visiters. Mr.
   Burget is well known to us, he has since lived for many years in New York,
   as a watch and clock-maker, and for some time he had the care of the public clocks ; his veracity is not disputed. He describes Mr. Paine as really abstermious, and when pressed to drink by those on whom he called during his rides, he usually refused with great firmness, but politely. In one of these rides he was met by De Witt Clinton, and their mutual greetings mere extremely hearty. Mr. Paine at this time was the reverse of morose, and though careless in his dress and prodigal of his snuff, he was always clean and well clothed. Mr. Burger describes him as familiar even with children, and humane to animals, occasionally sitting by the store, playing with the neighboring children, and communicating a friendly pat, even to a passing dog, assuring him he would not see him hurt. Such were the simple habits of the man, described to be wallowing in filth, drunkenness, and brutality. At the time of Mr. Paine's residence at his farm, Mr. Ward, now a coffee-roaster in Gold street, New York, and an assistant alderman, was then a little boy and residing about Rochelle. He remembers the impressions his mother and some religious peopIe made on him by speaking of Tom Paine, so that he concluded Tom Paine must be a very bad and brutal man. Some of his elder companions proposed going into Mr. Paine's orchard to obtain some fruit, and he, out of fear, kept at a distance behind, till he beheld, to his surprise, Mr. Paine come out and assist the boys in getting apples, patting one on the head and caressing another, and directing them where to get the best. He then advanced and received his share of encourgement, and the impression this kindness made on him determined him at a very early period to examine his writings. His mother at first took the books from him, but at a later period restored them to him, observing that he was then of an age to judge for himself; perhaps she had herself been gradually undeceived, both as to his character and writings.

   In 1804, Mr. Purity having left his farm, Mr. Paine hired one Derick to cultivate it, when he and the family of the Bonnevilles boarded for some time at Mr. James Wilburn’s, in Gold street. At this period Mr. John Fellows, still living in New York, and respected as a good citizen, boarded at the same house, and testifies to the propriety both of Mr. Paine's and Madame Bonneville's conduct. Mr. Paine's notions of economy did not however accord with those of Madame Bonneville. She was constantly incurring expenses which he deemed unnecessary, while she, relying upon the protection which he had promised both her and her husband, did not scruple to send bills in to him which he had not sanctioned. One of these was presented by Mr. Wilburn, for board to the amount of thirty-five dollars, which she had incurred beyond what he had sanctioned. This demand Mr. Paine resisted, perhaps to check Mrs. Bonneville, and make her either content with a simple competence at his farm in Bordentown, or with him at Rochelle, or that she should by industry acquire the means of a more ample expenditure. The action was brought, and Mr. Fellows was a witness; but the plaintiff was nonsuited, for the debt had been incurred without Mr. Paine's consent. No sooner, however, was the trial ended in the favor of Mr. Paine than he paid Mr. Wilburn the money; thus justifying the view we have taken of this subject. Honorable and liberal as this transaction is to Mr. Paine, Cheetham, and after him Mr. Paine's enemies, have retailed this story as if it mere to his discredit. There is no reconciling tastes or standards of expenditure. Madame Bonneville's was probably too high to be prudent. Taste is a gift of nature, but partly depending on education. A difference of tastes, where two persons are interested, will always lead to divisions, and Madame Bonneville does not seem to have readily yielded, or to have been very scrupulous as to the means she employed. On one occasion, as we learn from Mr. Carver, and as Cheetam has expressed in a note (if such authority can be relied on), 

   "Before his return to the city, Madame Bonneville paid him a visit, and arrived just at candle-light. She told him she had an order which she wished him to sign, for clothing for herself and the children, who were all in fact nearly naked. She presented the order. Paine said, 'I'll put it in my pocket and read it in the morning.'-' No,' said she, 'you must sign it to-night: J want to return and get the things, to-morrow.'- read it to-   night, give it me back.' Paine resisted all her importunities: he kept the paper until the morning, when he
   found, that instead of an order for clothing, it was a bond, duly drawn,
   for seven hundred pounds. Quite enraged, he went to Mrs. Dean's and told
   her the story, by whom, and by Mr. Carver, it is mentioned to me."

   In .these circumstances Madame Bonneville was sometimes left to want what
   she thought comforts, yet it does not appear that they had any serious
   quarrels, although these differences interrupted that cordial intimacy
   which both perhaps expected. Yet, at his death, we shall find he left her,
   her husband, and family, the bulk of his property, which was then very
   considerable.

   During this time Mr. Paine was not idle, he had generally some work on
   politics, science, or literature, on hand. He mixed a little too with
   party politics, communicated with some papers and periodicals, and, when
   Cheetham deserted the democratic cause, he lashed him with the severity of
   party spirit, but not unjustly; and hence the revenge which Cheetham
   afterward took. Mr. Paine now, too, published many little things which had
   been written long before for amusement when in France or in England. One
   of these was a piece of poetry in the style of "Chevy Chase," entitled, "
   The Strange Story of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram," perhaps the severest
   thing ever written upon tythes. In 1804 he published an essay on the
   invasion of England, and a treatise on gun-boats, full of valuable
   maritime information; and, in 1805, a treatise on the yellow fever, and
   suggests modes of prevention, especially in the improvement of the docks,
   so as to favor cleanliness. He had now been residing for some time at New
   Rochelle, when Mr. Carver rode out to see him, and in his zeal urged him
   to come into the city to oblige his friends, and offered him a room in his
   house. Mr. Paine consented, and. thus again became an inmate with Mr.
   Carver, without any engagement as to terms, an error extremely injurious
   in its consequence. Mr. Paine lived with the family, and occasionally made
   purchases for them, thus complicating the accounts. While he thus resided
   in Cedar street, with Mr. Carver, his friend, Elihu Palmer, with his wife,
   boarded in the same street, and within -sight of Mrs. Burtsell's; him Mr.
   Paine visited daily, and when Mr. Paine was seized with an epileptic fit,
   and fell down stairs, Mrs. Palmer attended on him. The" attendance which
   he thus required, when ill, still farther served to complicate the
   accounts between him and Mr. Carver. Mrs. Burtsell, still living in Cedar
   street, speaks with enthusiasm of the agreeable manners of Mr. Paine. She
   declares she never saw him intoxicated, though he was daily in her house.
   By the advice of a medical man Mr. Paine now left Mr. Carver's, and lived
   in Church street with Mr. Jarvis, the celebrated painter, still living.
   Here he soon recovered, and he and Mr. Jarvis became good companions; the
   one the greatest wit of the age, and the other, though now an old man, not
   deficient in sprightly thoughts or conversation, and abounding in
   information. Mr. Jarvis still speaks of their agreeable companionship with
   much gust, and relates a number of anecdotes highly characteristic; and he
   positively defies to us the language ascribed to him by Cheetham. As Mr.
   Jarvis was at this time in good circumstances, and received Mr. Paine as a
   companion, the Cheetham stories of Mr. Paine's dirtiness kill themselves,
   for it is absurd to suppose Mr. Jarvis would have had such a companion.
   The following are among the anecdotes related by Mr. Jarvis in relation to
   Mr. Paine:-

   "He usually took a nap after dinner, and would not be disturbed let who
   would call to see him. One afternoon, a very old lady, dressed in a large
   scarlet cloak, knocked at the door, and inquired for Thomas Paine. Mr.
   Jarvis told her he was / asleep. 'I am very sorry, she said, 'for that,
   for I want to see him very particularly.' Thinking it a pity to make an
   old woman call twice, Mr. Jarvis took her into Paine's bed-room and waked
   him. He rose upon one elbow, and then, with an expression of eye that
   staggered the old woman back a step or two, he asked-'What do you
   want?-'Is your name Paine?-' Yes,' Well then, I come from Almighty God, to
   tell you, that if you do not repent of your sins and believe in our
   blessed Savior Jesus Christ, you will be damned, and' 'Poh, poh, it is not
   true. You were not sent with such an impertinent message. Jarvis, make her
   go away. Pshaw, he would not send such a foolish ugly old woman, as you'
   about with his messages. Go away. Go, back. Shut the door.' The old lady
   raised both her hands, kept them so, and without saying another word,
   walked away in mute astonishment."

   Mr. Paine still visited New Rochelle, while ostensibly with Mr. Jarvis. He
   had left Mr. Carver without any direct settlement of accounts. Mr.
   Carver's circumstances had now altered from some family affairs which he
   could not control, and altered circumstances produced altered feelings.
   When Mr. Carver was in good circumstances, he thought only of the honor
   and pleasure of having Mr. Paine under the same roof with him, the terms
   of his board were a secondary consideration. We have already remarked that
   no agreement was made. Now in altered circumstances, of which Mr. Paine
   does not appear to be aware, his charge was an object. In the first note
   from Carver to Mr. Paine on this subject, published by Cheetham, Mr.
   Carver uses this expression, "1 have made a calculation of my expenditures
   on your account, the last time you were at my house, and find they amount
   to one hundred and fifty or sixty dollars." He charges for twenty two
   weeks for Mr. Paine and twelve for Mrs. Palmer, who assisted him in his
   illness; and he takes no notice of the few things Mr. Paine had purchased.
   He reminds Mr. Paine of his riches, and concludes by saying that he should
   not ask one cent if he could afford it. Mr. Paine at this time did not
   expect a long life. The fit and subsequent sickness had shaken his
   constitution. He had put Mr. Carver down in his will for a handsome sum;
   and from the manner of the invitation and supposed circumstances of Mr.
   Carver, perhaps he never expected a formal charge. At any rate, Mr. Paine
   was indignant at this charge, which he considered unjust, and proposed
   paying the money down at once, and having nothing more to do with him.
   This he was prevented from doing by Mr. John Fellows, who was present when
   the demand was made by Mr. Carver's boy. Mr. Fellows and Mr. Morton, the
   friends of Mr. Paine, considered the charge too high; and these finally
   settled the account upon what they considered just principles. The charge
   might have been perfectly just, as, in Mr. Carver's altered circumstances,
   he might have remembered former hospitalities, for he refers to them in
   one of his letters. There might have been but a trifling difference had
   Mr. Paine made up the account. The fault was, not having a definite
   agreement; and this foolish affair produced a quarrel. Mr. Paine replied
   to this note in an angry manner to Mr. Carver, and Carver, remarkable Tor
   his boldness, replied in the severest terms possible, giving the very
   worst construction to every event concerning Mr. Paine he could think of.
   His epileptic fit he insinuates was drunkenness; and he infers an improper
   connexion with Madame Bonneville, merely however in an inuendo, with a
   sarcastic remark about young Thomas, the godson, being like Mr. Paine. He
   refers to his trouble when Mr. Paine was sick, and reminds him of the
   quantity of water he procured for his personal cleanliness. This personal
   quarrel was soon forgotten, and the angry letters should have been
   destroyed; but both letters had been read, in public by some zealous
   friends, and copies were taken. They ought to have been obliterated; but
   after Mr. Paine's death, in 1809, Cheetham sought out Mr. Carver, obtained
   a copy, deceived him as to his intention and the nature of his
   publication, and published these letters against Carver's will. The mere
   publication of these letters would avail nothing among a candid people;
   they were avowedly written in anger, but there were persons who wished to
   believe. Even among such these angry letters could avail but little; but
   Mr. Cheetham, with fiendish ingenuity, not only inserted these letters,
   but in other parts of his life, presuming on their publication, boldly
   asserts as facts what Carver had only insinuated, leaving the impression
   that these letters are additional confirmations of the facts, instead of
   the only foundation for such reports. Thus he directly charges Mr. Paine
   with adultery with Madame Bonneville. He charges him with drunkenness,
   coarseness, "and dirtiness directly, which are only insinuated or implied
   in Carver's angry letters. In the first charge Mrs. Bonneville was
   implicated, and she very properly prosecuted Cheetham. On the trial, which
   we have read, he could only bring Mr. Carver as witness, and Mr. Carver
   could only say what he had before written, and his counsel was obliged to
   withdraw the justification and acknowledge that the accusation was a False
   and Malicious libel. The other charges applied to Mr. Paine only, and he
   was dead and could not prosecute. We, after diligent inquiry, believe them
   also false and malicious and that they have no other foundation than the
   angry letter of Mr. Carver, and the malicious revengeful spirit of
   Cheetham; for this reason we have detailed this foolish quarrel.

   We have now approached the year 1807, the seventieth of Mr. Paine's life,
   and two years only before his death. In the spring- of this year he
   removed to Broome street, at one Mr. Hitt's, a baker; here he lived some
   time; and while in Broome street he published an examination of the
   passages in the New Testament, quoted from the Old, and called `Prophesies
   of Jesus Christ,'&c. This work shows all the acumen of his former works;
   it marks the most laborious examination of the Scriptures. The Bible of
   Mr. Paine had been most carefully read, it was marked all over; indeed, no
   book had been read by him more than that.

   Mr. Paine lived successively in Partition street and afterward in
   Greenwich street, near the state-prison; but his sickness increased on
   him, and boarding-house attention was scarcely sufficient. Madame
   Bonneville took a small house for him, May, 1809, in Columbia street, (now
   grove street) and here she attended on him till his death. Mr. Paine was
   perfectly conscious of his approaching dissolution, and some time before
   he wished to arrange for his burial in the quakers' burying-ground, as the
   least obnoxious to his feelings; and for this purpose he applied to Mr.
   Willit Hicks, a preacher and influential member of that body, as his
   father had been of that persuasion. Mr. Hicks saw no objection, he had no
   prejudice on his own account, and brought this subject before the church;
   and to their discredit they denied the request.

   While Mr. Paine was at Mr. Jarvis's he seemed to foresee what would be the
   scene of his death-bed, and what some fanatical persons would attempt
   after his death. With that shrewdness of judgment which he always
   possessed, and which displayed itself during the revolution, by his
   instantly anticipating what the British government would do, he was
   enabled to prepare the people for the various proclamations and deceptive
   propositions before they arrived; nay, some of these appeared but a
   repetition of Paine's statements. The consequence was, they lost their
   effect, as far as his influence went. So, on this occasion, he foretold
   that when on a sickbed attempts would be made to convert him to
   Christianity, or to make it appear that he was converted; and that after
   his death reports would be spread of his death-bed repentance, of his
   unbelief; then, appealing to Mr. Jarvis, he observed, "Now I am in health,
   and in perfect soundness of mind; now is the time to express my opinion."
   And thus having called Mr. Jarvis to witness, he solemnly repeated his
   belief in his already written opinions.

   What Mr. Paine had foreseen came to pass. As his illness assumed a fatal
   appearance he was visited by men and women who obtruded upon his last
   moments their religious principles, either from christian simplicity and
   ignorant sincerity, and, most likely, in some of them, from hypocrisy; in
   the hopes of being able to contort some of his answers into a
   manifestation of fear or conversion, or to give them an opportunity of
   inventing a recantation for him. This is by no means an uncharitable
   supposition from the facts which followed his death, when the second part
   of Mt. Paine's prophesy was fulfilled by an invention of the kind, and by
   pious falsehoods promulgated to willing ears. The position is not
   uncharitable, for the dying moments of Voltaire have been, misrepresented
   by similar pious frauds. Nor are these the only instances where base
   falsehoods have been perpetrated in the name of God for a supposed pious
   purpose. Even the judge, who afterward sentenced Cheetham for a false and
   malicious libel on the memory of Mr. Paine and Madame Bonneville, declared
   Cheetham's life a useful book, because it tended to suppress the influence
   of Mr. Paine's writings. After these and other proofs of lying, for the
   sake of God, in remembrance too of the counterpart, we think we are
   justified in assuming that some of the visiters were hypocrites, and came
   there to distort his answers, or as an excuse for invention, than for any
   reasonable hope of converting and saving his soul. Among the most
   prominent and zealous visiters of Mr. Paine in his last days were the Rev.
   Mr. Milledollar, a presbyterian clergyman, and the Rev. Mr. Cunningham,
   about a fortnight before Mr. Paine's death. This latter gentleman told
   Paine that they visited him as friends and neighbors, and added, "You have
   now a full view of death, you cannot live long, and whosoever does not
   believe in Jesus Christ will assuredly be damned." Mr. Paine replied, "Let
   me have none of your popish stuff. Get away with you. Good morning, good
   morning." Mr. Milledollar attempted to address him, but was interrupted by
   Mr. Paine; and when they were gone, he said to Mrs. Hedden, his
   housekeeper, "Don't let'em come here again, they trouble me." In spite of
   Mr. Paine's declaration these gentlemen again attempted to obtrude
   themselves upon him, but they were refused admittance, as directed, by
   Mrs. Hedden, who piously added, "If God does not change his mind, she was
   sure no human power could."

   Mr. Willit Hicks, himself a preacher, a most respectable member of the
   friends, and a man of high standing in the community, yet alive, was then
   a neighbor of Mr. Paine, and in his last illness visited him daily, and on
   the day of his death. This gentleman, whom we especially visited, assured
   us that Mr. Paine was beset by clergymen; that on one occasion a methodist
   minister obtruded on Mr. Paine when he, Mr. Hicks, was present. The
   minister, we suppose sincerely, declared to Mr. Paine, with uplifted
   hands, that "unless he repented of his unbelief he would be damned." Mr.
   Hicks describes Mr. Paine as rising in his bed with indignation at the
   intrusion and ignorant presumption, and, sick as he was, declaring that if
   he was able he would immediately put him out of the room. We recently met
   one of these visiting' parties who sought to convert Mr. Paine on his
   death-bed, a Mr. Pigott, formerly a legislator, and now a man of high
   -moral standing. He has a brother a minister, a learned studious man, but
   unfortunately blind. He was so at the time of Mr. Paine's death, and he
   felt desirous of converting Mr. Paine, and engaged his brother, Mr.
   Pigott, our informant, to go with him. With some difficulty they obtained
   access, for Mr. Paine was then annoyed, as we have seen, by obtruders; but
   as this gentleman had once adopted the opinions of Mr. Paine, and was then
   blind, these qualities obtained the brothers an audience. Mr. Pigott
   remarked that Mr. Paine was in bed and sick, but that he received them
   with politeness, and cheerfully conversed with his brother, who was a
   learned thoughtful man; but when his brother proceeded to state that he
   had changed his opinions, and about to urge on Mr. Paine, sincerely in
   this case no doubt, the necessity of re-examination and conversion, Mr.
   Paine abruptly closed the conversation, and intimated his displeasure, and
   a wish for their immediate departure; and they thus left the room. Mr.
   Pigott describes Mr. Paine as a large-faced man, with a most penetrating
   eye, and immense expression of countenance, marking lively sensibilities,
   which the peculiar character of the visit brought out; for he had seen him
   pleased with his brother, intelligent and communicative, and then
   indignant at supposing the brother could change his opinions.

   The friends of Mr. Paine visited him till his death. Mr. Jarvis saw him
   one or two days before his dissolution, and on that day he had expected to
   die during the night, to Mr. Jarvis he expressed a continued belief in his
   written opinions; of this we are informed by Mr. Jarvis. Mr. Thomas Nixon,
   and his old friend Mr.Pelton, visited him expressly on the subject of his
   opinions, so did Mr. B. F. Hasken, a respectable attorney, now residing in
   Chambers street, New York; and, as they say, aware that falsehoods might
   be resorted to, because such means had before been used with others, they
   put down Mr. Paine's answers in writing. But when they first proposed
   their questions, as Mr. Paine did not know their motive, he seemed hurt
   that they should suppose he had any doubts on the subject. We have this
   account personally from Mr. Hasken, and we shall give a letter from Mr. T.
   Nixou and Mr. D. Pelton in another place. Mr. Paine suffered considerably
   in his illness, but he retained his mental faculties to the last. Death
   made slow approaches, and dropsy, attended by a cough and vomiting, were
   the last symptoms of approaching dissolution. On the eighth of June, about
   nine in the morning, he died, placid and almost without a struggle,
   notwithstanding his previous sufferings. And his last words, as recorded
   by Dr. Manley were-"I have no wish to believe on the subject," in answer
   to the question, "Do you wish to believe that Jesus is the Son of God" put
   by the pious doctor himself, who was curious on the subject.

   Fortunately we have the living testimony of the person who sat up with Mr.
   Paine on the night previous to his death. This testimony cost us a journey
   to Boston, but we are amply repaid for our labor. On our return we
   published the testimony in the Beacon of June 5, 1839, Vol. III., page
   240. A precaution we have taken for these eight years, during which time
   we have had the command of a press; for aware that many of the witnesses
   to this history, being then advanced in years, might die, we published
   their testimony in detail while yet alive, and capable of verifying our
   statements if correct, or of contradicting them if erroneous. As a
   specimen of this method of chronicling events, which we meant to imbody in
   this work, we extract the following from the Beacon (see reference
   above):-

                           THOMAS PAINE'S DEATH-BED.

   "We have just returned from Boston. One object of our visit to that city,
   was to see a Mr. Amasa Woodsworth, an engineer, now retired in a handsome
   cottage and garden at East Cambridge, Boston. This gentleman owned the
   house rented by Mrs. Bonneville for Mr. Paine at his death; while he lived
   next door. As an act of kindness Mr. Woodsworth visited Mr. Paine every
   day for six weeks before his death; he frequently sat up with him, and did
   so on the last two nights of his life. He was always there with Dr. Manley
   the physician, and assisted in removing Mr. Paine, while his bed was
   prepared: he was present when Dr. Manley asked Mr. Paine 'if he wished to
   believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God,' and he describes Mr.
   Paine's answer as animated. He says, that lying on his back, he used some
   action, and with much emphasis replied, 'I have no wish to believe on that
   subject.' He lived a short time after this, but was not known to speak,
   for he died tranquilly. He accounts for the insinuating style of Dr.
   Manley's letter, by stating that that gentleman just after its publication
   joined a church. He informs us that he has openly reproved the doctor for
   the falsity contained in the spirit of that letter, boldly declaring
   before Dr. Manley, who is yet living, that nothing which he saw justified
   his (the doctor's) insinuations. Mr. Woodsworth assures us that he neither
   heard nor saw anything to justify the belief of any mental change in the
   opinions of Mr. Paine previous to his death; but that being very ill and
   in pain, chiefly arising from the skin being removed in some parts by long
   laying, he was generally too uneasy to enjoy conversation on abstract
   subjects. This, then, is the best evidence that can be procured on this
   subject, and we publish it while the contravening parties are yet alive,
   and with the authority of Mr. Woodsworth.-G. V."

   Mr. Woodsworth is yet alive, and his testimony has derived additional
   importance from the evidence of Mr. Willet Hicks, which we shall shortly
   give. We refer especially to his remarks on the conduct of Dr. Manley; and
   when we produce Mr. Hicks' evidence, we shall have to request that our
   readers will return to the previous page, and again read this testimony,
   and compare it with that evidence.

   The clay after the death of Mr. Paine he was taken from his house in
   Greenwich village to New Rochelle, attended by a few friends, and was
   there buried on his farm, and a plain stone was erected to his memory,
   with the following inscription:-

                                 THOMAS PAINE,'

                           AUTHOR OF "COMMON SENSE."

   Died June 8, 1809, aged seventy-two years and five months.

   Mr. Paine left behind him a manuscript in answer to Bishop Watson. A copy
   of this is now in the hands of Madame Bonneville. A catholic priest in
   this country borrowed another copy of her, which has never been returned.

   In reviewing the life of Mr. Thomas Paine, we can see no defect in his
   public character. He was a citizen of the world, and served its interests
   to the best of his abilities, which were great. "Where liberty is, that is
   my country," said Dr. Franklin. Mr. Paine replied, "Where, liberty is not,
   that is my country," in reference to his exertions for liberty in the
   United States, England, and France. Paine wrote for mankind, and he may be
   emphatically styled "the friend of man." Here he was a good citizen, and a
   firm supporter of the government; because that government is based upon
   the rights of man, with the exception of the recognition of slavery in the
   southern states, unfortunately engrafted on the community before the war
   of independence. Whatever may be the opinion of Mr. Paine's theological
   works, his honesty in publishing them cannot be doubted "by any impartial
   reader. He believed those opinions true, and he believed the truth useful
   to mankind; while his especial object was to establish a religious
   principle in France, then becoming atheistical. The best argument in
   support of deism is to be found in the first part of the "Age of Reason."
   In this view of the subject Mr. Paine ought to have been taken by the hand
   by every believer in the existence, wisdom, power, and goodness of one
   supreme God, the maker and sustainer of the universe. Mr. Paine gave up
   the copyright of his theological works, just as he had done that of his
   political, and for the same reason, public good. His prudence in
   publishing his "Age of Reason," has been doubted; and if he had been
   ambitious, and had consulted his own interest, he would have abstained
   from such a publication; 'but he was neither ambitious nor covetous,
   except of honest fame, from honest and intelligent men, and that he has
   obtained. His political career was run, and the doors apparently closed
   against an extension of liberty at that time, and therefore his political
   usefulness was not injured. The United States had accomplished her
   independence; the revolution in France was completed, and liberty
   disgraced by excesses which the "Age of Reason" was intended to restrain,
   as it taught toleration; while in England the cause of liberty was checked
   by war, and his political works suppressed; but church aggressions were
   oppressive; there the "Age of Reason" had nearly effected a revolution,
   and the odious system of tythes was almost prostrated. We cannot then
   admit that Mr. Paine was imprudent in the publication. The age of reason
   has now arrived, at least in New York, and every man chooses to read and
   think for himself, whatever may be his conclusions; and Mr. Paine was
   scarcely in advance of the age.

   Of Mr. Paine's private character, we cannot say it was perfect. We should
   be sorry if we could; for then we could not hope to be believed. Mr. Paine
   was a part of human nature, and partook of its imperfections'. He wrote a
   foolish angry letter to Carver. He was, no doubt, penurious, to a limited
   extent, in his old age; and in sickness we can easily conceive of his
   being sometimes peevish and angry; he would not be man if he were not; but
   these are all the personal blemishes we can discover, and these are
   counterbalanced by the most noble and social qualities. He had a heart to
   feel for the distresses of mankind, and a head to conceive the means of
   relief. The charge of Madame Bonneville and family was at once an act of
   generosity and gratitude, however unpleasant their different tastes, or
   sense of propriety rendered their mutual duties. Mr. Paine possessed every
   prominent virtue (if not in perfection, which human nature forhids) in
   large proportions; and to these he added -the most social qualities. in
   public, without being a great talker, he was cheerful, communicative,
   abounding in information and anecdote, and in private he was not less
   agreeable, on the testimony of Mr. John Fellows, Mr. Jarvis, and a host of
   others, his companions.' Few people are aware of the morals and decorum of
   Mr. Paine. We have already observed that he never used vulgar oaths, and
   that he even goodhumoredly reproved his friends who did. Mr. Jarvis, who
   gave us the above information, observed that he once, by way of a joke,
   advised Mr. Paine to recant, and publish his recantation as a hoax,
   assuring him that he would then make a large fortune and get a good
   living. Mr. Paine, shaking his head, replied, "Tom Paine never told a
   lie." We do not discover in Mr. Paine, on any account, even a
   prevarication; such was his love of truth, while he had too much sense to
   be the dupe of the falsehood of others. The charge of drunkenness we can
   find no ground for, unless it occurred in France for a short period; and
   yet the company he there kept seems to forbid it. But as this charge is so
   generally believed we shall take the liberty of naming a few persons who
   knew him personally during his last residence in New York, some of whom,
   were in the habit of meeting him in public, and others in public and
   private societies, his companions for years; and of these, none ever saw
   him drunk, and most of them are well known and respected for their
   veracity. Among others, are Mr. John Fellows, Mr. D. Burger, Mr. Ming,
   senr., Judge Herttell, Mr. Jarvis, Mr. Bassinet, Nassau . street, Mr. B.
   F. Haskin, attorney, Chambers street, Mr. H. Magary, Willet Hicks, &c.,
   ire, to which we could add a number now dispersed about the states, as
   Amasa Woodsworth, near Boston, and all the old inhabitants of New
   Rochelle. There exists, too, a note on this subject to Mr. Caleb Bingham,
   bookseller, Boston, from Mr. Lovett, now deceased, but formerly of the
   City hotel, New York, where Mr. Paine put up after his last return to this
   country. In that note Mr. Lovett declares that Mr. Paine drank less than
   any of his other boarders, while at his hotel: and this accords with what
   Mr. Jarvis and others have informed us, that " he did not, and could not,
   drink much." Our author, for the existence of this note, is Mr. John
   Fellows, a gentleman well known, and whose veracity was never doubted. The
   note was written to answer an inquiry, and shown to Mr. John Fellows, our
   informant. This subject is puerile in itself, were there not a host who
   sincerely believe Mr. Paine to have been disgustingly a drunkard or a sot.
   Others of liberal minds, would at once perceive that he who possessed all
   his faculties to an advanced age unimpaired, could not commonly indulge in
   such gross excesses; and if he had indulged in excesses sometimes only, it
   was merely a fault in the age which has passed. But we have a much more
   important inference, beside a desire to undeceive those who have been
   duped. We think we have given abundant evidence that Mr. Paine was neither
   a sot nor drunkard; and we know of no contrary evidence, nothing but
   hearsay, which, when approached, vanishes. How then are we to regard this
   slander, its circulation, its reiteration, the boldness of the assailants,
   and the variety of forms it assumed, from the pulpit, the press, and in
   prints; and in private, from  o mouth to mouth, till his very friends were
   deceived, as we were, till we commenced this investigation. What now is
   the secret cause of slander, but the desire to check the influence of an
   individual or his writings. Could the "Age of Reason" and "Rights of Man"
   have been replied to, as he replied to Burke, we should never have heard
   these slanders; and kings and priests, lordlings, an aristocracy and their
   sycophants, and the sincerely pious, but duped disciples of Jesus, never
   would have formed one mighty mass to circulate a petty slander but from
   fear. Some feared the truth-it would disturb their old prejudices; but
   others feared reform, because where equal rights are maintained,
   privileges must be yielded, and the leeches on society must give up their
   hold. But why did the slanderers fix on the minor vice of inebriety? It is
   clear, by fixing on so small a vice as inebriety for the subject of
   slander, that there was no pretence even for other vices. Had he been
   unjust, not addicted to truth, a man wanting principle, or possessed of
   any public vice, these would necessarily have been laid hold of; and this
   is a negative evidence that no pretence for public vice existed. But how
   are we to regard his slanderers, the great body of whom are sincere,
   religious, and feminine. What an amalgamation do the slanderers of Paine
   present. The young girl of pious education vociferating Tom Paine, the
   filthy, drunken, Tom Paine; the pious teacher, perhaps also deceived, but
   without examination, preaching from the pulpit, that the opponent of the
   gospel scheme lived and died a degraded, a drunken being. To these are
   added the arch hypocrite, who knows the slander, but, from interested
   motives, joins the bitter cry of Tom Paine and inebriety. To these again
   are added the thousands of decent' people of all religions, who, finding
   it fashionable to pronounce the name of Paine with a sneer, generously
   believe what everybody says; and these add their mite of slander, making
   in the aggregate a mountain. But to these must yet be added the
   politician, the sneaking artful man who could not afford to lose a vote,
   and who, conscious of the contrary, chimes in with the pious, and
   pronounces Tom Paine and excess with supreme disgust, as an assurance that
   the speaker, the politician, is neither sot, drunkard, nor infidel; but
   even the political drunkard will join the. throng, and in his beer become
   extremely pious, and denounce Tom Paine as drunken and dirty, being
   willing to believe what he wishes to be true, as an excuse for himself,
   and degrading to the principles which Paine manifested, and which our
   drunken politician eschews. This mass have sought to overwhelm the name of
   Paine by associating it with intoxication, for which there is not a
   particle of proof. We cannot say a shadow, for a shadow there was, and
   this, perhaps, rendered the extension of the slander easy. Mr. Paine used,
   but did not abuse, liquor. He had a large florid face, and this, we
   believe, favored the report among those who only knew him by sight. If now
   we push back the slander, on whom does it rest. Are the sincere justified,
   because of their sincerity, in propagating slander? Is it in accordance
   with their religion? It is evident it exists, with religion most sincere.
   It exists with the ministers of religion some of whom were sincere but
   ignorant, others, not sincere, but interested; but the whole body was
   contaminated, minister and people, by circulating slander. This then was
   the visible religion Mr. Paine would have uprooted, while the political
   tyrants and sycophants, who joined the crusade, from the basest motives,
   and they have now their representatives, but ill contrast in sentiment and
   feelings with the noble principles of the man whose fame they would
   suppress. "The World My Country, To Do Good My Religion," were the sublime
   sentiments of this sincere and able advocate of human rights, whose fair
   fame has been thus abused.

   Immediately on the death of Mr. Paine, Cheetham, his political enemy,
   began to collect materials for his life, which was published the same
   year. We have already noticed the manner in which he collected those
   materials, and the recklessness with which he repeated the grossest and
   most malicious falsehoods, while in the most impudent manner he inserted
   the names of living witnesses. His conviction in the case of Madame
   Bonneville did something to undeceive the public; still Mr. Paine's memory
   suffers from this malignity. We had by us Mr. Carver's copy of Cheetham's
   first edition of the "Life of Paine," including the matter for which he
   (Cheetham) was prosecuted. This copy Mr. Carver sold to Mr. Parkins,
   ex-sheriff of London, and he, Mr. Parkins, loaned it to us. The book is
   margined by notes in Carver's handwriting; a few of which we shall notice
   or extract, although they are extremely coarse.

   The first note on the blank leaf after the preface, charges Cheetham with
   villifying Mr. Paine, and also Mr. Palmer, and plainly calls Mr. Cheetham
   a hypocrite. To this Carver puts his name and address, 36 Cedar street.
   Page 47, Cheetham says, " 'Common Sense' has no merit." Carver adds, "One
   more of Cheetham's lies." Page 209, Cheetham pretends a great reverence
   for received religious opinions. Carver adds, "I believe Cheetham was an
   athiest, as he told me that Mirabeau's 'System of Nature' could never be
   answered. He was a hypocrite." Page 210, Carver says, "Cheetham followed
   Palmer in principles, but was not half as good and moral a man." He adds,
   "Cheetham was an abominable liar." This last expression is repeated in
   various parts of the book, with some variations, such as, "Cheetham was a
   liar, and, if reports are true, he should have treated his wife better."
   On the last page Carver adds, "I once told Cheetham in his own house, as
   that he had had his hands crossed with British gold." This is one of the
   witnesses to whom Cheetham constantly refers; and this witness thus
   'denounces the man who refers to him, in the plain language we have shown,
   as not to be relied on. Mr. Jarvis is another, and he too uses the same
   expressions, in relation to Cheetham, which Carver does. Could we then
   get' access to the other living witness to whom Cheetham refers for proofs
   of Mr. Paine's failings, we might find in them the isame indignation and
   conviction of 'Cheetham's impudence and falsehoods.

   The cunning of Cheetham, in getting up materials for the life of Paine,
   will clearly be seen by again referring to Joel Barlow's letter to
   Cheetham. It is clear that Barlow was deceived, and we were deceived when
   we first read this letter in Cheetham's life of Paine, and continued
   deceived till we had examined the question of Mr. Paine's habits of
   temperance during the last years in New York. We then re-read Barlow's
   letter, and discovered the cunning. Mr. Barlow was in France at the time
   of Mr. Paine's death and knew not his habits. Cheetham wrote to him,
   informed him of his object, mentioned that Paine was drunken and low in
   his company toward the latter years of his life, and says he was informed
   that he was drunk when taken to prison in France. Now Mr. Barlow does not
   contradict Cheetham; he could not, as Cheetham had, the better opportunity
   of knowing facts, and Mr. Barlow does not suspect him of falsehood; as who
   would? He therefore presumes Mr. Cheetham correct in the statement, and
   goes on, not to excuse Paine, but to present his acknowledged good
   qualities as a set-off. Then Cheetham publishes this letter, and presents,
   to a cursory reader, Mr. Joel Barlow as acknowledging Mr. Paine's
   intemperance, and other infirmities, which had no other foundation than
   Cheetham's declaration, given to deceive Barlow; who afterward, as we have
   seen, gives Barlow's letter to deceive the public. In the next place
   Cheetham informs Mr. Barlow that he had heard Mr. Paine was drunk when
   sent to prison, and boldly gives his authority; as he did in the libel
   case Here Mr. Barlow happened to be qualified to judge, for Paine was
   brought to his house when he was arrested, and Mr. Barlow distinctly
   disavows the statements; but he is too polite, or too unsuspicious, to
   suppose himself cheated; yet it is evident on this assertion and alleged
   evidence, had Mr. Barlow not known by accident the contrary, he too would
   have presumed the fact on Cheetham's statement, and, perhaps, would have
   endeavored to excuse Mr. Paine for being intoxicated at such a time; when
   the fact was, he was not intoxicated, nor is there any evidence that he
   was in the habit of being intoxicated. Of the referee, Mr. Murray our
   friend Mr. John Fellows thus speaks:-

   "I happen to know something of the Mr. Murray alluded to above, whose
   testimony Mr. Barlow proves to be false. It is thus, that Cheetham
   collected stories injurious to the character of Paine. Mr. Murray was an
   English speculator in France, in the time of the revolution, and was once
   imprisoned as a spy. His enmity to Paine and the principles for which
   France was contending, I am confident (from my knowledge of the man),
   would induce him to fabricate any story calculated to throw 'obloquy upon
   either."

   Now who can doubt but that Cheetham knew the qualities of this man, whom
   he used as a referee, especially after wc have seen the unscrupulous
   character of Cheetham as to truth. But perhaps it will be asked, what
   could induce Cheetham thus to lie'? We have before remarked, that Cheetham
   had edited the leading republican paper; but that he had become a
   renegade, and was then in support of the English tory party, and was
   preparing to go to England, when he died. His life of Paine he knew was a
   passport to the English court, and he intended to defend the Bible and
   crown against Cobbet, who had shortly before broken his connexion with the
   English government, and was then in successful opposition. Such is the
   evidence we obtained from a gentleman who was then head-clerk to Cheetham,
   and this we find sustained by others. Besides, Paine had been very severe
   on Cheetham for his political change; and this would stimulate his
   revenge. The following, published by Mr. Paine a short time before his
   death, will show the relation Mr. Cheetham bore to Mr. Paine at that time,
   and how badly qualified such a man must be for an impartial biographer.
   Mr. Paine had published an article in the Public Advertiser, on the
   defence of the harbor of New York. Cheetham had attacked Paine on that
   article, and Mr. Paine in- his reply remarks:-

   "Mr. Cheetham speaks much about Locke, and says, that 'all political
   elementary writers on government since the days of Locke, including Mr.
   Paine, are but the mere retailers of his ideas and doctrines.' This is
   John Bullism all over.

   He also says, that `on-hereditary and elective government, Mr. Paine, in
   his "Common Sense" and "Rights of Man," has followed Locke idea for idea.'
   It may be so for what I know, for I never read Locke, nor ever had the
   work in my hand, and by what I have heard of it from Horne Tooke, I had no
   inducement to read it. It is a speculative, not a practical work, and the
   style of it is heavy and tedious, as all Locke's writings are.'

   I suppose Locke has spoken of hereditary and elective monarchy, but the
   representative, as laid down in 'Common Sense and 'Rights of Man,' is an
   entirely different thing to elective monarchy. So far from taking any
   ideas from Locke or from anybody else, it was the absurd expression of a
   mere John Bull in England, about the year 1773, that first caused me to
   turn my mind to systems of government. In speaking of the then king of
   Prussia, called the Great Frederick, he said, 'He is the right sort of man
   for a king, for he has a deal of the devil in him.' This set me to think
   if a system of government could not exist that did not require the devil,
   and I succeeded without any help from anybody. It is a great deal that may
   be learned from absurdity, and I expect to learn something from James
   Cheetham. When I do, I will let him know in the Public Advertiser.

   In the conclusion of the piece of mine, which Mr. Cheetham has vomited his
   spleen upon, I threw out some reproach against those who, instead of
   practising themselves in arms and artillery, that they might be prepared
   to defend NewYork, should it be attacked, were continually employing
   themselves on imaginary fortifications, and skulking behind projects of
   obstruction. As Mr. Cheetham supposed himself included in this description
   (and he thought right), he made, as he imagined, an effectual retort, but
   in doing this, as in everything else he does, he betrayed his want of
   knowledge, both as to the spirit and circumstances of the times he speaks
   of.

   'I would not,' says Mr. Cheetham, 'charge with cowardice that gentleman
   [meaning me], who, in the "times that tried men's souls," stuck very
   correctly to his pen in a safe retreat, and never handled a musket
   offensively.'

   By this paragraph, Mr. Cheetham must have supposed, that when congress
   retreated from Philadelphia to Baltimore, in the 'times that tried men's
   souls,' that I retreated with them as secretary to the committee for
   foreign affairs.

   In the first place, the committee for foreign affairs did not exist at
   that time.

   In the next place, I served in the army the whole of the 'time that tried
   men's souls,' from the beginning to the end.

   Soon after the declaration of independence, July 4, 1776, congress
   recommended that a body of ten thousand men, to be called the flying camp,
   because it was to act wherever necessary, should be formed from the
   militia and volunteers of Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. I went with
   one division from Pennsylvania, under General Roberdeau. We were stationed
   at Perth Amboy, and afterward at Bergen; and when the time of the flying
   camp expired, and they went home, I went to Fort Lee, and served as
   aid-de-camp to Greene, who commanded at Fort Lee, and was with him through
   the whole of the black times of that trying campaign.

   I began the first number of the ' Crisis,' beginning with the well-known
   expression, 'These are the times that try men's souls', at Newark, upon
   the retreat from Fort Lee, and continued writing it at every place we
   stopped at, and had it printed at Philadelphia the 19th of December, six
   days before the taking the Hessians at Trenton, which, with the affair at
   Princeton, the week after, put an end to the black times.

   It therefore is not true, that I stuck to my pen in a safe retreat with
   congress from Philadelphia to Baltimore in the 'times that tried men's
   souls.' But if I had done so, I should not have published the cowardice
   James Cheetham has done. In speaking of the affair of the Driver
   sloop-of-war, at Charleston, South Carolina, he said in his paper, if the
   Driver and her comrades should take into their heads to come here (New
   York), we must submit. What abominable cowardice, for a man to have such a
   thought in his mind, that a city containing twenty thousand able-bodied
   men, numbers of them as stout in person as himself, should submit to a
   sloop-of-war containing about a hundred and fifty men.

   After this, Mr. Cheetham will take care how he attacks old revolutionary
   characters, whose undiscouraged intrepidity, in the ' times that tried
   men's souls,' made a home for him to come to.

    Thomas Paine

   New York, Aug. 21, 1807."

                         "REPRIMAND TO JAMES CHEETHAM.'

   If James Cheetham, editor of the 'New York American Citizen,' thinks to
   draw me into a controversy with him, he, is greatly mistaken. In the first
   place, I hold him too cheap; and his well-known character for abuse and
   blackguarding, renders any altercation with him dishonorable; and beside
   this, it would take up too much of my time to put his blunders to-rights.
   He cannot write without blundering, neither can he write truth, of which I
   will give another instance.

   He quotes the following paragraph from the first part of 'Rights of Man,
   and then grounds a false assertion upon it:-

   'Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself, in all cases,
   as the ages and generations that preceded it. The vanity and presumption
   of governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous and insolent of all
   tyrannies. Man has no property in man, neither has one generation a
   property in the generation that is to follow.'

   Mr. Cheetham having made this short quotation says: 'Mr. Paine here and
   there glances at the absurdity of hereditary government, but the passage
   just quoted is the only attempt at argument against it contained in the "
   Rights of Man."

   Is James Cheetham an idiot, or has the envy and malignity of his mind
   possessed him with a spirit of wilful lying?

   The short passage he has quoted (which is taken from the middle of a
   paragraph) is on the third, and in some editions on the fourth page of the
   first part of 'Rights of Man.' It contains a general principle, on which
   the arguments and statements against hereditary succession are founded in
   the progress of that work.

   If Mr. Cheetham had looked farther into the work, 'Rights of Man,' he
   would have come to a paragraph ending with the expression, 'hereditary
   succession cannot be established as a legal thing? The work then goes on
   to say:-

   'In order to arrive at a more perfect decision on this head (that is, that
   hereditary succession cannot be established as a legal thing), it- is
   proper to consider the generation which undertakes to establish a family
   with hereditary powers, apart and separate from the generations which are
   to follow, and also to consider the character in which the generation acts
   with respect to succeeding generations.

   'The generation which selects a person and puts him at the head of its
   government with the title of- king, or any other distinction, acts its own
   choice, be it wise or foolish, as a free agent for itself. The person so
   set up is not hereditary, but selected and appointed, and the generation
   which sets him up do not live under an hereditary government, but under a
   government of its own choice and establishment. Were the generation which
   set him up, and the person so set up, to live forever, it never could
   become hereditary succession; and, of consequence, hereditary succession
   can only take place on the death of the first parties.

   As, therefore, hereditary succession is out of the question with respect
   to the first generation, we have now to consider the character in which
   that generation acts with respect to the commencing generation, and to all
   succeeding ones.

   It assumes a character to which it has neither right nor title. It changes
   itself from a legislator to a testator, and affects to make its will,
   which is to have operation after the demise of the makers, to bequeath the
   government; and it not only attempts to bequeath, but to establish over
   the succeeding generation a new and different form of government from that
   under which, itself lived. Itself, as already observed, lived not under an
   hereditary government, but under a government of its own choice and
   establishment, and it now attempts, by virtue of a will and testament,
   which it has no authority to make, to take from the commencing generation,
   and all succeeding ones, the right and free agency by which itself acted.'

   Now, without giving any farther extracts from the work, 'Rights of Man,'
   on the subject of hereditary succession, what is here given ought to cover
   James Cheetham with shame for the falsehood he has advanced. But as a man
   who has no sense of honor has no sense of shame, Mr. Cheetham will be able
   to read this with an unblushing front.

   Several writers before Locke had remarked on the absurdity of hereditary
   succession, but there they stopped. Buchanan, a Scots historian, who lived
   more than a hundred years before Locke, reproaches Malcolm II., king of
   Scotland, and his father, Kenethus, for making the crown of Scotland
   hereditary in his family, 'by which means,' says Buchanan, 'the kingdom
   must frequently be possessed by a child or a fool; whereas before, the
   Scots used to make choice of that prince of the royal family that was best
   qualified to govern and protect his people.'

   But I know of no author, nor of any work, before 'Common Sense' and
   'Rights of Man' appeared, that has attacked and exposed hereditary
   succession on the ground of illegality, which is the strongest of all
   grounds to attack it upon; for if the right to set it up do not exist-and
   that it does not is certain, because it is establishing a form of
   government, not for themselves, but for a future race of people--all
   discussion upon the subject ends at once. But James Cheetham has not sense
   enough to see this.

   He has got something into his head .about Locke, and he keeps it there,
   for he does not give a single quotation from him to support the random
   assertion he makes concerning Locke.

   'It is to Locke in particular,' says Cheetham, 'who wrote his incomparable
   essay on government, in 1689, that we are almost wholly indebted for those
   political lights which conducted us to our revolution.'

   This is-both libellous and false. The revolutionary contest began in
   opposition to the assumed rights of the British parliament 'to bind
   America in all cases whatsoever,' and there can be nothing in Locke, who
   wrote in 1689, that .can have reference to such a case. The tax upon tea,
   which brought on hostilities, was an experiment on the part of the British
   government to enforce the practice of that assumed right, which was called
   the declaratory act. James Cheetham talks of times and circumstances he
   knows nothing of, for he did not come here till several years after the
   war; yet in speaking of the revolution, he uses the words we, and us, and
   our revolution. It is common in England, in ridiculing self-conceited
   importance, to say, ' What a long tail our cat has got!'

   The people of America, in conducting their revolution, learned nothing
   from Locke; nor was his name, or his work, ever mentioned during the
   revolution, that I know of. The case America was in was a new one, without
   any former example, and the people had to find their way as well as they
   could by the lights that arose among themselves, of which I can honestly
   and proudly say, I did my part. Locke was employed by the first settlers
   of South Carolina to draw up a form of government for that province, but
   it was such an inconsistent aristocratical thing, that it was rejected.
   Perhaps Mr. Cheetham does not know of this, but he may know it if he will
   inquire.

   Mr. Cheetham hypocritically says, 'I advise Mr. Paine, as a friend, to
   write no more.'

   In return for this civility in words, I will inform him of something for
   his good, which is, that he has been going down hill in the opinion of the
   republicans for a long time past. Good principles will defend themselves;
   but the abuse and scurrility in Cheetham's paper have given very general
   offence to his subscribers. Another complaint is, that his paper is not a
   newspaper. It does not give the news from Europe till it becomes old in
   every other paper. There are, perhaps, two causes for this: as a John
   Bull, he does Sot like the news from Europe; and as a dabbler in
   scribbling, he prefers filling his paper with his own stuff.

   It is probable he will be called upon to explain on what ground of
   compromise (for it has the appearance of a compromise)the intimacy between
   him and the Anglo-Irish emissary Cullen, alias Carpenter, began and
   continued. He is now giving symptoms of becoming a successor of Cullen, as
   Cullen was the successor of Cobbett. As there is now a well-conducted
   republican paper established in New York (the Public Advertiser), Mr.
   Cheetham cannot have the same 'range for his scurrility he had before.

                                                                 Thomas Paine

   September 5, 1807."

   "CHEETHAM AND HIS TORY PAPER.

   Cheetham is frequently giving symptoms of being the successor of Cullen,
   alias Carpenter, as Cullen was the successor of Cobbett, alias Porcupine.
   Like him, he is seeking to involve the United States in a quarrel with
   France for the benefit of England.

   In his paper of Tuesday, September 22, he has a long abusive piece against
   France, under the title of "Remarks" on the speech of the arch-chancellor
   of France to the French senate. This is a matter that Cheetham, as an
   adopted American citizen, has no business with; and as a John Bull it is
   impertinence in him to come here to spit out his venom against France, But
   Cheetham cannot live without quarreling, nor write without abuse. He is a
   disgrace to the republicans, whose principle is to live in peace and
   friendship with all nations, and not to interfere in the domestic concerns
   of any.

   Cheetham seems to regret that peace is made on the continent of Europe,
   and he shows his spleen against it by the following roundabout scurrilous
   paragraph. 'The people of France,' says he, 'now breathe the air of peace,
   under slavery, closer, more systematic, military, and universal [Cheetham
   knows nothing about it], than that with which they were overwhelmed
   previous to the beginning of the long continued calamity.' This is spoken
   exactly in the character of a stupid prejudiced John Bull, who, shut up in
   his island, and ignorant of the world, suppose all nations slaves but
   themselves; whereas, those at a distance can see, that of all people
   enslaved by their own governments, none are so much so as the people of
   England. Had Cheetham stayed in England till this time, he would have had
   to shoulder a musket, and this would have been dreadful to him, for, as
   all bullies are cowards, the smell of gunpowder would be as horrid to
   Cheetham, as the scent of a skunk to other animals.

   The danger to which the city of New York was exposed, by the continual
   abuse of France in such papers as Cullen's, was, that the French
   government might be induced to consider the city of New York as a British
   colony, such as it was during the revolutionary war, and exclude her from
   the commerce of the continent of Europe, as she has excluded Britain.
   Cheetham is following the footsteps of Cullen.

   The French nation, under all its changes of government, has always behaved
   in a civil and friendly manner to the United States. We have no cause of
   dispute with France. It was by the aid of France in men, money, and ships,
   that the revolution and independence of the United States were so
   completely established; and it is scarcely sufferable that a prejudiced
   and surly-tempered John Bull should fix himself among us to abuse a
   friendly power.

   September 25, 1807."

                               "NOTE TO CHEETHAM.

   Mr. Cheetham: Unless you make a public apology for the abuse and falsehood
   in your paper of Tuesday, October 27, respecting me, I will prosecute you
   for lying.

   It is by your talent for abuse and falsehood, that you have brought so
   many prosecutions on your back. You cannot even state truth without
   running it to falsehood. There was matter enough against Morgan Lewis
   without going a syllable beyond the truth.

                                                                 Thomas Paine

   October 27, 1807."

                         "TO THE CITIZENS OF NEW YORK.

   In a letter from the president of the United States, of October 9, after
   his mentioning that he did not expect the Revenge back under a month from
   that date, adds, 'In the meantime, all the little circumstances coming to
   our knowledge are unfavorable to our wishes for 'peace.'

   As this might be useful information to men in mercantile pursuits and
   speculations, and who had no guide to go by, whether to send out their
   vessels, or not, I mentioned it to such of my republican friends as called
   to see me; and that the information, if so useful, might not be confined
   to one distinction of men only, I mentioned it also to Mr. Coleman, of the
   Evening Post, who came to me on account of a piece I sent to him
   concerning Cheetham's insulting message to Mr. Frank, of the Public
   Advertiser. How it got into the newspapers I know not; Mr. Coleman, I
   suppose, can give the best account of that. , Cheetham then published a
   most abusive piece in his paper, and in his vulgar style of language said,
   "Paine has told a lie" and then insinuated as if I had forged the letter.
   It is by his propensity to blackguarding and lying, that he has brought so
   many prosecutions on his back. - He says he has nine. He will now have one
   more. If an unprincipled bully cannot be reformed, he can be punished.

                                                                Thomas Paine.

   November 20, 1807."

   "THE EMISSARY CHEETHAM.

   Cheetham can now be considered in no other light than o British emissary,
   or successor to the impostor Cullen, alias Carpenter, whom Cheetham handed
   out in his newspaper, as a gentlemanly sort of a man. Cheetham finding the
   republicans are casting him off, is holding out signs to be employed as a
   British partisan.

   Cheetham, in his papers of December 29 and 30, has two long pieces about
   the embargo, which he labors to prove is not laid on in consequence of any
   dispute with England, but in consequence of some imperious demands on the
   part of France. This John Bull is an idiot in diplomatic affairs.

   Cheetham says, 'Mr. Monroe's despatches, which were laid ^fc before
   congress, and which cong^ss concluded did not authorize an embargo, are
   dated London, October 10th. In the opinion of congress,' continues
   Cheetham, 'and I venture to say of Mr. Monroe, an immediate war with
   England was therefore by no means probable.'

   Cheetham has been so long in the habit of giving false information, that
   truth is to him like a foreign language.

   The president laid the despatches of Mr. Monroe, of October , 10th before
   congress; but as they were in daily expectation of later information by
   the arrival of the Revenge schooner, and also of the personal arrival of
   Mr. Monroe, congress received it as preparatory information, but came to
   no conclusion on their contents.

   Cheetham says, that the Leopard, which brought Mr. Monroe's despatches, of
   October 10th, sailed from London on the 16th of October, and that the
   Revenge sailed from London for Cherbourg, on the same day, at which time,
   says Cheetham, there was no probability of an immediate war with England.

   In a letter I received from London, dated October 15th, and which I
   published in the Philadelphia Aurora, and in the New York Public
   Advertiser, the writer, in speaking of the British ministry, says, 'Their
   cup of iniquity is nearly full, they only want to go to war with America
   to fill it up; and it is the opinion here [London] that that measure is
   resolved on. They will make no concessions unless it be to deceive.' The
   letter is dated one day before the Revenge sailed from London, and I
   suppose came by the Revenge; yet Cheethnm tells his readers there was then
   no probability of a war with America. Cheetham's information is never
   entitled to credit.

   When the Revenge sailed with the president's proclamation, and the
   instructions to Mr. Monroe, the writer of this knows she was ordered to
   come from London to France. It was expected she would be detained in the
   two countries about a month, and be back here about the 16th of November.

   Her coming from London to France, would give Mr. Monroe the opportunity
   (for foreign ministers do not correspond by post, but by express) of
   communicating to Mr. Armstrong, at Paris, the plans and projects of the
   British ministry.

   Soon after the arrival of the Revenge at Cherbourg, a French port on the
   channel, General Armstrong sent circular letters to the American consuls
   in France, to hasten the departure of the American vessels as fast as
   possible. Several paragraphs in the English newspapers, and which have
   been copied into the American papers, stated, that the British ministry
   intended to seize American vessels coming to, or going from, any port in
   France.. As Mr. Monroe would get knowledge of this, as well as the writer
   of the letter to Thomas Paine, of October 15th, he would communicate it to
   General Armstrong at Paris; and this accounts for General Armstrong's
   circular letter, after the arrival of the Revenge schooner from London.

   If Britain put her threat in force, that of taking American vessels going
   to or coming from France, it is probable the French government will
   retaliate, and take American vessels going to or coming from England; and
   this resolution on the part of France, had a natural tendency to prevent
   American vessels being taken, because Britain, by setting the example,
   will suffer more by it than France.

   The British blockading decree, that of seizing neutral vessels going to or
   from France, was to have been published on the 14th of November, but the
   news from London of the 14th by the Jane, is silent on the subject. The
   apprehension of retaliation has, most probably, stopped the British
   ministry in their career. Jan. 7, 1S0S."

   In another letter, dated August 25, 1808 (and Mr. Paine died, as we have
   seen, in 1809), he thus expresses himself of Cheetham, that "in religion
   he was a hypocrite, and in politics a John Bull," said in reference to
   Cheatham's abuse of Bonaparte and the French. Mr. Paine adds in the same
   letter: "The ward meetings have done exceedingly right in posting
   Cheetham. The people in the country and abroad will now know that he does
   not belong to the popular republican party, and that he is an English
   impostor."

   Whether these letters derive some asperity from party politics or not, is
   a matter of no consequence to our subject. The statement of facts is no
   doubt correct, and the feelings of Cheetham toward Paine must be anything
   but friendly. When, therefore, a party hack, as Cheetham doubtless was,
   disappointed and a renegade, with talents, as he certainly possessed, but
   embittered in feelings and regardless of truth, as all circumstances
   contribute to show, what could be expected from such a man, but just what
   he produced-a life of Paine abounding in bold falsehoods, cunningly
   contrived, and addressed to a people who wished to be deceived! The
   compliment paid Cheetham by Judge Hoffman, in extenuation of heavy
   damages, when convicted by the clearest evidence- of gross slander in the
   case of Madame Bonneville; viz, that "he had produced a work useful to
   religion^" explains .the position of Cheetham, his life of Paine, and the
   public. The politicians succumbed to the religious part of the community,
   and both sacrificed the fame of Paine to their supposed interest. The
   religious because they thought they did God service, and hypocrites and
   politicians because they imagined an injury , from the association of the
   name of Paine with theirs. Individuals did lift up their voices in defence
   of the memory of Paine, but as these had neither the press nor public
   sympathy, nor public opinion, nor fashion,on their side, their voices were
   not heard, and falsehood triumphed for a time; not, however, without
   witnesses, whose testimony was recorded from time to time, which might be
   accumulated and presented at a proper season a time to which Joel Barlow
   looked forward. That time we believe has now arrived, and Judge Hoffman,
   were he now alive, dare not repeat his infamous sentiment, that "Cheetham
   had written a book useful to religion." The very sentiment is now scoffed
   by the religious people of - the age, who are so far advanced in
   civilization as to scorn a religion that needs falsehood for its support.
   In the history of nations there are periods of fanaticism, but a steady
   progress in liberality. Cromwell!s time was a period of fanaticism,
   succeeded indeed by licentiousness, and after the French revolution a
   re-action took place, and fanaticism prevailed, first in England, and then
   on this side the Atlantic; and in the darkness of which Cheetham slipped
   in, his life of Paine. But we yet believe that justice will be done to the
   memory of the man who caused the declaration of independence, showed how
   it coud be maintained, and was the light of the republic in the "times
   which tried men's souls," (Paine). And we farther believe that this age is
   sufficiently intelligent to investigate the merits of one of the men of
   the revolution, and sufficiently-honest to do his memory justice. The
   second part of Mr. Paine's prophecy was not suffered to want fulfilment.
   In vain did his friends witness the sincerity of his belief, his firmness
   and calmness at the last moment; in vain did Dr. Manley try to extort from
   him a recantation, and in vain did clerical gentlemen assail him when
   infirm in body. In vain did Mr. Jarvis, Colonel Daniel Pelton, and our
   living friend Mr. Haskins, and the respected Willet Hicks, receive his
   last declaration in presence of death; in vain was all this. A few zealous
   pious hypocrites had determined on a conversion, or on a conviction and
   remorse, and therefore a woman was made a tool of to propagate such
   charges; and one Charles Collins, now alive, was found base enough to
   publish her foolish tales, not avowed till some years after the death of
   Mr. Paine; such a circumstance however is easily jumped over, when that is
   revealed which is wanted. This subject has however been treated on in the
   preface to the Boston edition of Mr. Paine's theological works, written by
   our friend Mr. John Fellows, now- alive, and frequently alluded to in this
   work, from which we shall therefore extract, as we have examined into it,
   and, with one exception, are satisfied with the correctness of the
   statement.

   "I cannot relinquish this subject without taking, notice of one of the
   most vile and, wicked stories that was ever engendered in the fruitful
   imagination of depraved mortals. It was fabricated by a woman, named Mary
   Hinsdale, and published by one Charles Collins, at New York, or rather, it
   is probable that this work was the joint production of Collins, and some
   other fanaticks, and that they induced this stupid, ignorant woman to
   stand sponsor for it.

   It states, in substance, that Thomas Paine, in his last illness, was in
   thee most pitiable condition for want of the mere necessaries of life; and
   that the neighbors, out of sheer compassion, contributed their aid to
   supply him with sustenance: that he had become converted to Christianity,
   and lamented that all his religious works had not been burnt: that Mrs.
   Bonneville was in the utmost distress for having abandoned her religion,
   as she (M. H.) said, for that of Mr. Paine, which he now told her would
   not answer the purpose, &c. In all this rodomontade there is not a single,
   solitary ray of truth to give it a colorable pretext. It is humiliating to
   be under the necessity of exposing such contemptible nonsense. Collins, if
   he was not the author, was assured of its falsity. But being full of the
   spirit of fanaticism and intolerance, and believing, no doubt, that the
   end sanctified the means, he continued to circulate the pious fraud, and
   the 'clergy exultingly retailed it from the pulpit. Nothing but religious
   phrensy could have induced Collins, after being warned of the crime he was
   committing, to persist in publishing this abominable trash. He had the
   hardihood even to apply to William Cobbett for the purpose of inducing him
   to insert it in the life of Thomas Paine, which Mr. Cobbett then
   contemplated to write. For which he received due chastisement from the pen
   of that distinguished writer,' in a number of his Register. Mr. Cobbett
   subsequently having taken great pains to investigate the falsity of this
   story, exposed and refuted it in the most ample manner This I have not
   seen, nor is the Register, containing the article alluded to, before me.
   Mrs. Bonneville was absent in France at the time of its first appearance
   in New York, and when shown to her on her return to America, although her
   feelings were highly agitated at the baseness of the fabrication, she
   would not permit her name to appear in print in competition with that of
   Mary Hinsdale. No notice, therefore, has been taken of it, excepting by
   Mr. Cobbett. Indeed, it was considered by the friends of Mr. Paine
   generally to be too contemptible to controvert. But as many pious people
   continue to believe, or pretend to believe in this stupid story, it was
   thought proper to say a few words upon it in this publication.

   The facts are as follow: Mary Hinsdale was hired at service in the family
   of Mr. Willet Hicks, residing at Greenwich village, in the neighborhood of
   Mr. Paine, who occasionally sent some little delicacies to him in the time
   of his sickness, a's every good neighbor would do; ,and this woman was the
   bearer. Here is the whole- foundation upon which the distorted imagination
   of Mary Hinsdale, or some one for her, has raised this diabolical fiction.
   Mr. Hicks was in the habit of seeing Mr, Paine frequently, and must have
   known if such a wonderful revolution had taken place in his mind, as is
   stated, and he does not hesitate to say, that the whole account is a pious
   fraud. Mr. Hicks is a respectable merchant at New York, and any one there,
   who has any doubts on the subject,  o  by calling on him will be
   satisfied. Even James Cheetham, the libeller of Mr. Paine, acknowledges
   that he died in the religious faith which he had inculcated in his
   writings. Which is also attested by his physician, Dr. Manley, and all
   those who visited him in his last illness. But to, put this matter beyond
   all cavil, I shall add the certificate of two old and -highly respectable
   citizens, Thomas Nixon of New York, and Captain Daniel Pelton of New
   Rochelle. It was addressed to William GCobbett, under an expectation that
   he was about to write the life of Thomas Paine, and left with a friend to
   be handed to him; but as the undertaking was relinquished, it was never
   delivered, and is now in my possession, in the hand writing of the
   signers; and is as follows:-

                            TO MR. WILLIAM C0BBETT.

   Sir: Having been informed that you have a design to write a history of the
   life and writings of Thomas Paine, if you have been furnished with
   materials in respect to his religious opinions, or rather of his
   recantation of his former opinions before his death, all you have heard of
   his recanting is false. Being aware that such Reports would be raised
   after his death by fanatics which infested his house at the time it was
   expected he would die, we, the subscribers, intimate acquaintances of
   Thomas Paine, since the year 1776, went to his house-he was sitting up in
   a chair, and apparently in the full vigor and use of all his mental
   faculties. We interrogated him on his religious opinions, and if he had
   changed his mind or repented of anything he had said or wrote on that
   subject. He answered, ' not at all,' and appeared rather offended at our
   supposition that any change should take place in his mind. We took down in
   writing the questions put to him, and his answers thereto, before a number
   of persons then in his room, among whom were his doctor, Mrs. Bonneville,
   &c. This paper is mislaid and cannot be found at present, but the above is
   the substance, which can be attested by many living witnesses. Thomas
   Nixon.

                                                                Daniel Felton

   New York April 24, 1818."

   We had resolved on so much of the manuscript before we saw Mr. Willet
   Hicks, before mentioned; and if it were not a rule in evidence to obtain
   the best, in the most direct manner, we should not have sought an
   interview, for we had supposed that those who had gone before us had
   obtained all that was desirable from that gentleman; but, to our surprise,
   on seeing Mr. Hicks, as a duty which we owed the public, we learned that
   Mary Hinsdale never saw Paine to Mr. Hicks's knowledge; that the fact of
   his sending some delicacy from his table as a compliment occurred but a
   very few times, and that he always commissioned his daughters on this
   errand of kindness, and he designated Mrs. Cheeseman, then a little girl,
   bu^ now the wife of one of our celebrated physicians, as the daughter
   especially engaged, and that she states that Mary Hinsdale once wished to
   go with her, but was refused. So that on the testimony o,f Mr. Willet
   Hicks, the whole story of confession of Paine to such a woman, remorse,
   wretchedness, despair, and conversion, rests on Mary Hinsdale once wishing
   to go with Mr. Hicks's daughter to Mr. Paine's. The secret of such a
   fabrication on such a foundation is easily explained. On farther
   conversation with Mr. Hicks, he informed us, that when it was known that
   he visited Mr. Paine ^aily, many, of the Friends (to which sect he
   belonged, and of which he was a preacher), thought he would make some
   religious impression on Mr. Paine, and that after his death he was
   extremely annoyed at numbers of them pressing him to say something
   detrimental of Paine, or that he was converted. The old gentleman remarked
   to us: "You can have no idea of the anxiety of our people on this subject;
   I was beset by them, both here and in England, where I soon after went on
   a journey." He remarked, they wished to convict Mr. Paine of calling on
   Jesus; they would"say, he observed, "Didst thee never hear hear him call
   on Christ 1" On reference to our notes, which we took for accuracy, we
   find, Mr>> Hicks even declared: "You cannot conceive what a deal of
   trouble I had, and as for money, I could have had any sums if I would have
   said anything against Thomas Paine, or if I would even have consented to
   remain silent. They informed me that the doctor was willing to say
   something that would satisfy them if I would engage to be silent only;
   but," remarked Mr. Hicks to us, "they observed, he (the doctor) knows the
   standing of Willet Hicks, and that he knew all about Paine, and if he (Mr.
   Hicks) should contradict what I say, he would destroy my testimony." Such
   is the simple testimony recently obtained of this gentleman, who is yet
   alive, and was, when we saw him, at the>resi dence of his son-in-law, Dr.
   Cheeseman. Mr. Hicks, in conclusion, remarked of Mr. Paine, that " he was
   a good man, an honest man," and with great indignation he remarked, "he
   was not a man to talk with Mary Hinsdale." Here then is the Key to Mary
   Hinsdale's fabrication; the intense feeling of a portion of the friends on
   the subject of Mr. Paine's works. We say a portion; for, though Mr. Hicks
   uses the expression, "he was beset with them, both here and in England," a
   portion could beset him. Mr. Hicks was himself a. friend, a pious friend,
   and a preacher, and an honorable man of high standing, and such as he was
   and is, such we have no doubt were and are many. Besides,' we can -readily
   conceive that this intense feeling was chiefly among the more orthodox, as
   some of these in every sect have always left the most. From the multitude
   who raised the cry of Tom Paine, we need not minutely examine the question
   as to numbers in this portion of the Friends; we can readily believe there
   would be enough to effect the object. If, too, Mr. Hicks, who was rich,
   could have had any sum, as he expresses himself, then Mary Hinsdale could
   have had any sum for her invention. We do not know that she did; but we
   can readily believe that she would not want a Charles Collin, or any one
   else, to assist her in getting out such a work; and that those who wished
   to believe would not be at in such trouble to inquire after the
   credibility of the evidence. Will our readers now turn to page 156, where
   we have inserted Mr. Amasa Woodsworth's testimony, and observe in what
   language he speaks of Dr. Manley, yet alive, and enjoying a post of honor.
   Now we do not know that Mr. Hicks referred to Dr. Manley, when he says
   that the friends informed him the doctor was willing to say something, he
   might have meant some other doctor; we merely give his words as he gave
   them to us. But there is a curious coincidence in these two witnesses,
   both respectable, but who have moved in very different spheres, and who,
   perhaps, have never 'seen each other since the death of Paine. Their
   evidence was taken, the one near Boston, two years ago, the other two
   months ago, in New York, and they both infer a disposition to cheat the
   public by those who were professionally about Mr. Paine on his death-bed.
   Dr. Manley has published a letter, and has thus thrown himself on the
   public, and we have a right to examine that letter. He there, indeed,
   gives you the last words of Paine, "I have no wish to believe on that
   subject." But what would .he have said had Willet Hicks consented to
   silence, and if Amasa Woodsworth had not been present. We again remark
   that we do not know that Mr. Hicks referred to Dr. Manley, but we do know
   that Dr. Manley published a pamphlet, in which he endeavors to insinuate,
   that in spite of Mr. Paine's declaration, that he did conceal his real
   sentiments; and this he infers from looks and exclamations which he alone
   saw and heard. And now let us remind our readers that Amasa Woodsworth
   says, he was always there with Dr. Manley; yet Amasa Woodsworth saw none
   of these expression, and heard no exclamations indicating mental agony,
   but such expressions as resulted from bodily pain, and that from a cause
   explicitly given, viz, "the skin in some parts being removed from long
   lying." The judge, Hoffman, who tried Cheetham on the libel against Madame
   Bonneville, complimented Mr. Cheetham for writing a very useful book in
   favor of religion, although it did contain, falsehoods and libel j, and in
   the same way the doctor may think his published letter may be useful to
   hundreds of thousands, and he no doubt did, and perhaps does think so; and
   no doubt some persons will regret that Mr. Willet Hicks stood in the way
   of some more dignified person than Mary Hinsdale, belying Mr. Paine on his
   death-bed. The whole, however, is explained by the intense feelings of a
   portion of the Friends, who could beset Mr.Hicks in the manner they did,
   'Didst thee never hear him call on Christ?" or who could intimate a wish
   that he would say that Paine recanted, or, at least, that he would promise
   silence, while others should testify falsely; and who could intimate
   reward for such perfidy. "As for money I could have had any sum," is the
   language of Mr. Hicks toward the portion of "friends" that beset him Now
   if this feeling'could exist among the Friends, carried out as we have seen
   it in the case of Mary Hinsdale, to what extent must it have existed in
   other classes, more superstitious, less educated, less accustomed to truth
   and more to passion, as the devoutly pious among every class, who believe
   their feelings the effects of- divine influence, and who are consequently
   easily misled by these feel ing-s. And when we consider that all this
   pious feeling was backed by an interested class of clergy; and by corrupt
   poli-. ticians, who wished the votes of the pious, can we be surprised at
   the calumny under which he has lain, and that even his friends should have
   been deceived on some points, from the incessant clamor and apparent
   universality of the accusations. We shall now furnish Mr. W. Cobbett's
   account of this transaction of Mr. Collins and Mary Hinsdale, on which,
   perhaps, we have thrown some light:-

   "CURIOUS HISTORY OF A CALUMNY ON PAINE.

   It is a part of the business of a press, sold to the cause of corruption,
   to calumniate those, dead or alive, who have most effectually labored
   against that cause; and, as Paine was the most powerful and effectual of
   those laborers, so to calumniate him has been an object of their peculiar
   attention and care. Among other things said against this famous man, is,
   that he recanted before he died; and that in his last illness, he
   discovered horrible fears of death. This is/to be sure, a very good answer
   to what these same persons say about his hardened infidelity. But, it is a
   pure, unadulterated falsehood. This falsehood, which I shall presently
   trace to its origin (the heart of a profound hypocrite), was cried about
   the streets of Liverpool, when I landed there in November last. Thence it
   found its way to the grand receptacle and distributor of falsehood and
   calumny, the London press, which has sent it all over this kingdom. One
   country paper, however, pre-eminent in all that is foul and mean, affects
   to possess original matter and authentic information on the subject; and,
   indeed, it pledges itself for the character of the gentleman from whom it
   says it has received the pretended authentic account. The country paper I
   allude to, is-the Norwich Mercury, printed and published by one Burks.

   The Norwich Mercury did not imagine that-any one would take the pains to
   expose this tissue of falsehoods. In the first place, why does he not name
   his 'gentleman of- such excellent character? How these informers skulk!
   Mr. Burks can pledge himself for the character of the "gentleman"
   informer; but, where are we to get a pledge for the character of Mr.
   Burks, who,' if we are to judge from this act of his, stands in need of
   very good sponsors.

   Let us look, a little, at the internal evidence of the falsehood of this
   story. Mr. Paine possessed, at his death, an unencumbered estate of two
   hundred and fifty acres of land, not more than twenty miles from New York.
   He possessed a considerable sum beside. These he left by will. Will any
   one believe, that he was, on his dying-bed, in the want of proper
   nourishment, and that he was in a deplorable state as to apartments and
   necessaries? Then, was it likely, that when a neighbor's maid-servant went
   to carry him a little present of sweetmeats, or the like, that he would
   begin a conversation on theology with her? And is it not monstrous to
   suppose, that he would call himself the devil's agent to Her, and not
   leave behind him any recantation at all, though he had such ample time for
   doing it, and though this confidant was so ready to receive it and to take
   care of it ?' The story is false upon the face of it: and nothing but a
   simpleton, or something a great deal worse, would have given it
   circulation and affected to believe it to be true.

   I happen to know the origin of this story: and I possess .the real,
   original document, whence have proceeded the divers editions of the
   falsehood, of the very invention of which I was^ perhaps, myself, the
   innocent cause!'

   About two years ago, I, being then on Long Island, published my intention
   of writing an account of the life, labors, and death of Paine. Soon after
   this, a quaker at New York, named Charles Collins, made many applications
   for an interview with me, which at last he obtained. I found that his
   object was to persuade me that Paine had recanted. 'I laughed at him, and
   sent him away. But he returned again and again to the charge. He wanted me
   to promise that I would say that 'it was said,' that Paine had recanted.
   'No,' said I; 'but I will say that you say it, and that you tell a lie,
   unless yon prove the truth of what you say; and if you do that, I shall
   gladly insert the fact.' This posed friend Charley,' whom I suspected to
   be a most consummate hypocrite. He had a sodden face, a simper, and
   manoeuvred his features, precisely like the most perfidious wretch that I
   have known, or ever read or heard of. He was precisely the reverse of my
   honest, open, and sincere quaker friends, the Pauls of Pennsylvania.
   Friend Charley plied me with remonstrances and reasonings, but I always
   answered him. 'Give me proof; name persons; state times; state precise
   words, or I denounce you as a 'liar.' Thus put to his trumps, friend
   Charley resorted to the aid of a person of his own stamp; and, at last, he
   brought me a paper, containing matter, of which the above statement of Mr.
   Burks is a garbled edition!\\ This paper, very cautiously and craftily
   drawn up, contained only the initials of names. This would not do. I made
   him, at last, put down the full name and the address of the informer,
   'Mary Hinsdale, No.10 Anthony street, New York.' I got this from friend
   Charley some time about June last; and had no opportunity of visiting the
   party till late in October, just before I sailed.

   The informer was a quaker woman, who, at the time of Mr. Paine's last
   illness, was a servant in the family of Mr. Willet Hicks, an eminent
   merchant, a man of excellent character, a quaker, and even, I believe, a
   quaker preacher. Mr. Hicks, a kind and liberal and rich man, visited Mr.
   Paine in his illness, and, from his house, which was near that of Mr.
   Paine, little nice things (as is the practice in America) were sometimes
   Sent to him; of which this servant, friend Mary, was the bearer; and this
   was the way in which the lying cant got into the room of Mr. Paine.

   To 'friend Mary,' therefore, I went on the twenty-sixth of October last,
   with friend Charley's paper in my pocket. I found her in a lodging in a
   back-room up one pair of stairs. I knew that I had no common cunning to
   set my wit against. I began with all the art that I was master of. I had
   got a prodigiously broad-brimmed hat on. I patted a little child that she
   had sitting beside her; I called her friend; and played all the awkward
   tricks of an undisciplined wheedler. But I was compelled to come quickly
   to business. She asked, 'What's thy name, friend? and the moment I said
   William Cobbett, up went her mouth as tight as a purse! Sack-making
   appeared to be her occupation; and that I might not extract through her
   eyes that which she was resolved I should not get out of her mouth, she
   went and took up a sack and began to sew; and not another look or glance
   could I get from her.

   However, I took out my paper, read it, and stopping at several points,
   asked her if it was true. Talk of the Jesuits, indeed! The whole tribe of
   Loyola, who had shaken so many kingdoms to their base, never possessed a
   millionth part of the cunning of this drab-colored little woman, whose
   face simplicity and innocence seemed to have chosen as the place of their
   triumph! She shuffled; she evaded; she equivocated; she warded on; she
   affected not to understand me, not to understand the paper, not to
   remember: and all this with so much seeming simplicity and
   single-heartedness, and in a voice so mild, so soft, and so sweet, that if
   the devil had been sitting where I was, he would certainly have jumped up
   and hugged her to his bosom.

   The result was: that it was so long ago, that she could not speak
   positively to any part of the matter: that she would not say that any part
   of the paper was true: that she had never seen the paper; and that she had
   never given ' friend Charley' (for so she called him) authority to say
   anything about the matter in her name. I pushed her closely upon the
   subject of the 'unhappy French female.'- Asked her whether she should know
   her again.-' Oh, no! friend; I tell thee that I have no recollection of
   any person or thing that I saw at Thomas Paine's house.' The truth is,
   that the cunning little thing knew that the French lady was at hand; and
   that detection was' easy, if she had said that she should know her upon
   sight!

   I had now nothing to do but to bring friend Charley's nose to the
   grindstone. But Charley, who is a grocer, living in Cherry street, near
   Pearl street, though so pious a man, and doubtless in great haste to get
   to everlasting bliss, had moved out of the city for fear of the fever, not
   liking, apparently, to1 go off to the next world in a yellow skin, And
   thus he escaped me, who sailed from New York in four days afterward: or
   Charley should have found, that there was something else on this side the
   grave, pretty nearly as troublesome and as dreadful as the yellow fever.

   This is, I think, a pretty good instance of the length to which hypocrisy
   will go. The whole, as far as relates to recantation, and to the 'unhappy
   French female,' is a lie from the beginning to the end. Mr. Paine declares
   in his last will, that he retains all his publicly expressed opinions as
   to religion. His executors, and many other gentlemen of undoubted
   veracity, had the same declaration from his dying lips. Mr. Willet Hicks
   visited him till nearly the last. This gentleman says, that there was no
   change of opinion intimated to him: and will any man believe that Paine
   would have withheld from Mr. Hicks, that which 'he was so forward to
   communicate to Mr. Hicks' servant-girl?

   Observe, reader, that in this tissue of falsehoods, is included a most
   foul and venomous slander on a woman of virtue and of spotless honor. But
   hypocrites will stick at nothing. Calumny is their weapon, and a base
   press is the hand to wield it. Mr. Bourke, of Norwich, will not insert
   this article, nor will he acknowledge his error. He. knows that the
   calumny which he has circulated, has done what he intended it to do; and
   he and the ' gentleman^ for whose character he pledges himself, will
   wholly disregard good men's contempt, so long as it does not diminish
   their gains'.

   This is not at all a question of religion. It is a question of moral
   truth. Whether Mr. Paine's opinions were correct or erroneous, has nothing
   to do with this matter.

   We have not yet done with this subject. By a curious coincidence we have
   become acquainted with a Mr. J. W. Lockwood, of New York. This gentleman
   had a sister, a member of the FriEnds, who died about two-and-twenty years
   ago. On her death, Mary Hinsdale, who was known to the family, stated to
   them that she should come to the funeral, for that she had met Mary
   Lockwood a short time before her death; and that she (Mary Lockwood) had
   said to her: "Mary [ Hinsdale], I do not expect to live long; my views are
   changed; I wish thee to come to my funeral, and make this declaration to
   my friends then assembled," and that consequently she should come. The
   relatives of the deceased, who were Hicksite quakers, or friends, knew the
   falseness of this statement. Those who had sat by her bed-side, and heard
   her continued and last declarations on religious subjects (for she was
   emphatically a religious young woman), knew that no change had taken
   place. Her brother, our informant, had heard her express her opinions with
   great satisfaction. He and her other relatives therefore said so to Mary
   Hinsdale, but invited her to attend the funeral. Mary Hinsdale did not
   attend. The falsehood was notorious and occasioned a good deal of loud
   conversation; and this Mr. Lockwood supposes deterred this orthodox friend
   from appearing among them.

   We recently published the above account in the Beacon, and referred to Mr.
   Cobbett's account, which we had formerly published. On this publication
   Mr. Collins, frequently named above, called on us, not to complain of our
   remarks, but to assure us that his conscience could not suffer the Beacon
   to be left at his house, to be forwarded to a friend in the West Indies,
   as formerly. To this we made no objection; but finding Mr. C. Collins in
   our house, and knowing the importance of his testimony, we at once asked
   him what induced him to publish the account of Mary Hinsdale. He assured
   us he then thought it true. He believed that she had seen Mr. Paine, and
   that Mr. Paine might confess to her, a girl, when he would not to Willet
   Hicks. He knew that many of their most respected friends did not believe
   the account'. He knew that Mr. W. Hicks did not, whom he highly respected;
   but

   * Followers of Elias Hicks, not orthodox, or believers in the common
   scheme of salvation by the atonement yet he thought it might be true. We
   asked Mr. G. Collins what he thought of the character of Mary Hinsdale
   now? He replied, that some of our friends believe she indulges in opiates,
   and do not give her credit for truth. We asked, and do you believe they
   are justified in their opinions? He replied, "0 yes, I believe they speak
   the truth" (Mr. Lockwood had given us the same opinion), but C, added "
   This does not affect her testimony when a young woman; she might then have
   spoken the truth." Such is the testimony of Charles Collins, in relation
   to Mary Hinsdale, whom he assisted in publishing her fabrication of Mr.
   Paine's death-bed scenes, based on her wish to see Mr. Paine, and which
   fabrication has been echoed from pulpit to pulpit, and from press to
   press, in this country and England, and sanctioned by thousands of pious
   people who wished the account true.

   There is one more subject to which our attention has been drawn, and to
   which Cheetham refers, Mr. Paine's alleged ingratitude to Mr. Monroe. We
   have seen in the body of this work that Mr. Monroe took upon himself to
   declare Mr. Paine a citizen of the United States, and to presume that
   Washington, then president, must feel an interest in him. It is evident
   that Mr. Monroe did all he could in the absence of direct instructions
   from his government about Mr. Paine, which he does not appear to have
   possessed. And we have seen, when Mr. Paine finally left the prison, that
   he went by invitation to Mr. Monroe's house, and that he remained there
   above a year. We hear nothing of any engagement, and we cannot conceive
   that Mr. Monroe, as plenipotentiary at Paris, would take boarders, or that
   Mr. Paine would stay at his house uninvited, or one moment beyond an
   apparent welcome. Mr. Paine's company before, and at this time, was sought
   by many as an honor. He afterward resided with Mr. Bonneville, either with
   or without an engagement for board; but in that case we know, when
   Bonneville was ruined by Bonaparte, for publishing a republican paper,
   that Mr. Paine, finding on his return here the means of hospitality,
   generously invited the whole family to share his comforts. We cannot,
   therefore, perceive in Mr. Paine a natural ingratitude. Cheetham states,
   and others have repeated it, that Mr. Monroe afterward became poor, and
   applied to Mr. Paine, whom he said was then rich, to pay for his board,
   while residing with the consul at Paris, and that Mr. Paine took no notice
   of the demand, and was therefore ungrateful. If this really occurred, and
   we think it likely, all we can say is that Mr. Monroe at this period must
   have, become penurious. He was at that time looking forward to the
   presidency, which he afterward obtained; and if, while in this situation,
   he made a demand as a hoarding house keeper, while acting as minister in
   France, and that to a distinguished individual whom he had invited to his
   house, and with whom he had made no such engagement, for none is even
   pretended, he must have forgotten the dignity of an American consul in
   France, as well as a presumptive successor to the presidency. We are
   perfectly aware that men, when they become old, frequently become
   parsimonious; Mr. Paine did, in part; and that others, who are both just
   and generous, on particular occasions, are constitutionally parsimonious.
   This was the' case with Franklin. We have therefore made some inquiry as
   to Mr. Monroe, and we find that he was not unmindful of his interest.
   While acting as minister at Paris, Mr. Jefferson, then president, gave him
   a commission to transact some business in a neighboring country, intending
   an appropriation to Mr. Monroe for this service, but to save to the
   country the outfit of an especial minister or consul, which we believe is
   about nine thousand dollars. This outfit Mr. Monroe, we find, afterward
   claimed and recovered, and hence we think it possible that he might have
   made the charge upon Mr. Paine before stated; but unless Mr. Paine had
   agreed to such a charge, which does not appear from Mr. Monroe's alleged
   letter, we think the affair rather to the discredit of the latter than to
   Mr. Paine; and if Mr. Paine treated the subject in the manner alleged, he
   probably considered as we do, that the demand never ought to have been
   made.

   We shall now conclude with the will of Mr. Paine. This falsifies at once,
   one part of Mary Hinsdale's relation, viz, Mr. Paine's poverty; and one
   part being shown to be false we can have no belief in the rest, which
   depends on the same authority. The fact is, she is now living, and is
   known as a silly lying woman, disgraced "in the eyes of some of her former
   religious connexions for this very crime.

   THE WILL OF MR. THOMAS PAINE.

   "The People of the State of New York, by the Grace of God, Free and

   Philadelphia, in 1775, and published in that city the beginning of

   after appointed, Walter Morton and Thomas Addis Emmet, thirty shares I
   hold in the New York Phoenix Insurance Company, which cost me 14-70
   dollars, they are worth now upward of 1500 dollars, and all my moveable
   effects, and also the money that may be in my trunk or elsewhere at the
   time of my . decease, paying thereout the expenses of my funeral, in trust
   as to the said shares, moveables, and money, for Margaret Brazier

   and dispose of the north side thereof, now in the occupation of Andrew A.
   Dean, beginning at the west end of the orchard and running in a line with
   the land sold to Coles, to the end of the farm, and to apply the money
   arising from such sale as hereinafter directed. I give to, my friends
   Walter Morton, of the New York Phoenix Insurance company, and Thomas Addis
   Emmet, counsellor-at-law, late of Ireland, two hundred dollars each, and
   one hundred dollars to Mrs. Palmer, widow of Elihu Palmer, late of New

   to Nicholas Bonneville, of Paris, husband of Margaret B. Bonneville
   aforesaid: and as to the south part of the said farm, containing upward of
   one hundred acres, in trust, to rent out the same or otherwise put it to
   profit, as shall be found most advisable, and to pay the rents and profits
   thereof to the said Margaret B. Bonneville, in trust for her children,
   Benjamin Bonneville and Thomas Bonneville, their education and
   maintenance, until they come to the age of twenty-one years, in order that
   she may bring them well up, give them good and useful learning, and
   instruct them in their duty to God, and 'the practice of morality, the
   rent of the land or the interest of the money for which it may be sold, as
   hereinafter mentioned, to be employed in their education. And after the
   youngest of the said children shall have arrived at the age of twenty-one
   years, in further trust to convey the same to the said children share and
   share alike in fee simple. But if it shall be thought advisable by my
   executors and executrix, or the survivor or survivors of them, at any time
   before the youngest of the said children shall come of age, to sell and
   dispose of the said south side of the said farm, in that case I hereby
   authorize and empower my said executors to sell and dispose of the same,
   and I direct that the money arising from such sale be put into stock,

   of them on his or their coming of age. I know not if the society of people
   called quakers admit a person to be buried in their burying-ground; who
   does not belong to their society, but if they do or will admit me, I would
   prefer being buried there,my father belonged to that profession, and I was
   partly brought up in it. But if it is not consistent with their rules to
   do this, I desire to be buried on my farm at New Rochelle. The place where

   Ireland, and Margaret B. Bonneville, executors and executrix to this my
   last will and testament, requesting them the said Walter Morton and Thomas
   Addis Emmet, that they will give what assistance they conveniently can to
   Mrs. Bonneville, and see that the children be well brought up. Thus
   placing confidence in their friendship, I herewith take my final leave of
   them and of, the world. 1 have lived an honest and useful life to mankind;
   my time has been spent in doing good; and I die in perfect composure and
   resignation to the will of my Creator God. Dated this eighteenth day of
   January, in the year one thousand eight hundred and nine, and I have also

   MONUMENT TO THOMAS PAINE.

   On the fourth of July, 1837, we visited the tomb, or place of burial, of
   Thomas Paine, near New Rochelle, and in the Beacon of July 15, 1837, thus
   described it (see Beacon, Vol. I. page 331):-

   "The tomb is close by the road side, but over a stone fence, and now
   consists of a low, broken, rough, dry stone wall, of oblong shape, of
   about eight by four feet, with loose stones, grass, and earth, in the
   centre; the upright slab, simply marked with

   'THOMAS PAINE, AUTHOR OF COMMON SENSE,'

   no longer exists. After Cobbett violated the grave, and removed the bones
   from the remains of Mr. Paine, the headstone was broken, and pieces
   successively removed by different visiters: one large fragment was
   preserved by a lady in an opposite cottage, in which Mr. Paine had
   sometimes boarded, and in which Mr. and Madame Bonneville afterward
   boarded; but this fragment gradually suffered diminution, as successive
   visiters begged a piece of what they could no longer steal.. To preserve
   the last remnant, this lady has had it plastered up in a wall.

   We discovered that the lady mentioned, the nearest neighbor to the tomb,
   would be favorable to the repair of the tomb, and we learned that she
   believed that such repairs would be popular among the neighbors; and on
   this understanding, in which we have not been, deceived, we determined to
   commence a subscription to repair the tomb, or put up a monument; and
   before we left the village we obtained from Mr. James, who had then marble
   saw-mills in New Rochelle, a promise to be at' the expense of putting up a
   heavy block of marble, instead of a head-stone, if purchased by
   subscription; subsequently Mr. Frazee, an eminent architect, offered in
   conjunction with some friends to give the work on a monument, if the
   materials were procured, and other expenses paid. This has now been
   accomplished, and paid for. The monument stands on the Paine farm, at the
   head of the grave, on twenty feet square, enclosed by a substantial wall
   on three sides, and an iron railing in front (not yet up, March 1841). It
   is built of the marble of the country, and is valued at about thirteen
   hundred dollars. The accompanying cut is a faint representation, and the
   following extract from a letter from the architect will best describe the
   monument and the feelings of the neighborhood, which is two miles from the
   village of New Rochelle."-G. V.

   To Mr. Vale:

   Will you please to inform our friends that the monument to Thomas Paine is
   erected! On Friday last I took with me a rigger and went up to the
   quarries, and on that day we got the marble to the spot with the machinery
   and other apparatus necessary to the work.-At an early hour on Saturday
   morning, we mustered all hands at the grave, and commenced the erection of
   the monument in good earnest, and in good spirits. Everything worked well,
   and at three o'clock, P. M., the crown piece was on, and the erection
   complete.-No person was hurt, nor any part of the work broken or
   injured.-The people up there say it is a chaste and beautiful structure.
   Its purely Grecian character and simplicity of form, render its general
   effect truly impressive and interesting.-The summit is twelve and a half
   feet above the level of the road at that

   [graphic]

                               Paine's monument.

   I was much pleased to find that among the number of fifty persons and
   more, that were assembled to witness our labors, not an unkind look was
   seen, nor an unfriendly expression heard, during the time. All looked and
   spake as though their hearts were glad at seeing such marked regard-such
   noble and lasting honor paid to the Great Patriot of our revolution and
   the defender of the rights of man.

   I have a little trimming to do yet on the head, which will occupy me the
   best part of a day; this I will endeavor to accomplish this week when the
   monument will be completed.

   Very truly yours,

                                                                JOHN FRAZEE."
