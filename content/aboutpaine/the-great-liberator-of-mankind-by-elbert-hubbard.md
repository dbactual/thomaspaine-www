   The following was written for TPNHA in 1907 and updated in 1915. 
   Some of the claims in the essay are incorrect, but it still stands up 
   as an historic document.

   Thomas Paine was the greatest writer of his day. He was one of the
   foremost patriots of his time, and America owes him a great debt of
   gratitude and devotion.

   While to me Paine's chief claim to immortality lies in his efforts to
   free us from the shackles of religious and political superstition, yet in
   looking over what he achieved or proposed, I find that he is entitled to
   the gratitude of all mankind in that he first of all men:
    
   proposed American Independence;

   suggested the Federal Union of States;

   proposed the abolition of negro slavery;

   suggested protection for dumb animals;

   proposed arbitration and international peace;

   advocated justice to women;

   pointed out the reality of human brotherhood;

   suggested international copyright;

   proposed the education of children of the poor at public expense;

   suggested a great republic of all the nations of the world; and

   urged the purchase of the great Louisiana Territory.
    
   But for more than a century the world ignored this brilliant mind or else
   heaped obloquy on his name. It looks now, though, as if the name of Thomas
   Paine will soon occupy that niche in the world's Temple of Fame where it
   properly belongs. The Thomas Paine National Historical Association, in New
   York City, has done splendid work in bringing to Paine
   a just measure of recognition. It no longer suffices to dismiss him as a
   "filthy little atheist".  We recognize such persiflage as pure piffle,
   indicative of its muddy source. Thinkers everywhere
   proclaiming Thomas Paine the great statesman, philosopher, and patriot.

   The genius of Paine was a flower that blossomed slowly. But life is a
   sequence, and the man who does great work has been in training for it.
   There is nothing like keeping in condition; one does not know when he is
   going to be called upon. Prepared people do not have to hunt for a
   position - the position hunts for them. Paine knew more about what he was
   getting ready for than did Benjamin Franklin, when, at 20, he studied
   French evenings and dived deep into history.

   The humble origin of Paine and his Quaker ancestry were most helpful
   factors in his career. Only a working man who had tasted hardship could
   sympathize with the overtaxed and oppressed.

   Paine's schooling was slight; but his parents, though poor, were
   thinking people, for nothing sharpens the wits of men, preventing fatty
   degeneration of the cerebrum, like persecution. In this respect the Jews
   and the Quakers have been greatly blessed and benefited.

   Very early in life Paine acquired the study habit. And for the youth
   who has the study habit no pedagogic tears need be shed. There were
   debating clubs at coffeehouses, where great themes were discussed; and our
   young weaver began his career by defending the Quakers. He acquired local
   reputation as a weaver of thoughts upon the warp and woof of words.
   Occasionally he occupied the pulpit in Dissenting chapels.
        
   These were great times in England--the air was all athrob with
   thought and feeling. A great tidal wave of unrest swept the land. lt was
   an epoch of growth second only in history to the Italian Renaissance. The
   2 Wesleys were attacking the Church and calling upon men to methodize
   their lives and eliminate folly; Edward Gibbon was writing his The Decline
   and Fall of the Roman Empire: Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, was
   polishing his brogue; James Boswell was busy blithering about a book
   concerning a man; Captain James Cook was sailing the seas finding
   continents; the 2 Pitts and Charles Fox were giving the King unpalatable
   advice; Horace Walpole was setting up his private press at Strawberry
   Hill; the Herschels-brother and sister-were sweeping the heavens for
   comets; Reynolds, West, Lawrence, Romney, and Gainsborough were founding
   the first school of British art; and David Hume, the Scotchman, was
   putting forth arguments irrefutable.

   And into this seething discontent came Thomas Paine, the weaver,
   reading, studying, thinking, talking, with nothing to lose but his 
   reputation. At a coffeehouse in London, Paine met that other great thinker, 
   Franklin. They became fast friends. Franklin recognized the genius of Paine 
   and urged him to come to America, the land of opportunity, a country where 
   thinkers were needed. He gave Paine letters of introduction and recommendation, 
   and on November 30, 1774, Paine landed in the "NewW orld".

   Paine was a writing man; the very first American writing man - and I
   am humiliated when I have to acknowledge that we had to get him from
   England.  He was the first man who ever wrote these words, "The American
   Nation", and also these, "The United States of America".
   
   Paine is the first American writer who had a literary style, and we
   have not had so many since but that you may count them on the fingers of
   one hand. Note this sample of antithesis:
   There are but two natural sources of wealth-the earth and the ocean-and to
   lose the right to either, in our situation, is to put the other up for
   sale.
    
   During 1775, Paine edited The Pennsylvania Magazine and in its pages
   appeared several notable essays from his pen, among them his pleas:

   for the abolition of slavery,

   for justice to women, and

   for the suppression of dueling.

   His writing from the first commanded profound attention. During the
   latter half of his first year in America, he wrote Common Sense, that
   precious pamphlet that awakened the colonists to a realization of their
   best interests, separation from their "mother-country"- independence.
   
   Common Sense was published early in January of the following year. It
   had an enormous sale and was directly responsible for the Declaration of
   Independence, 6 months later, and the successful revolution that followed.
   Paine took no financial profits from his work, but gave all to the
   revolutionary cause. The pamphlet was published anonymously- "Written by
   an Englishman".

   In France, John Adams was accused of writing Common Sense. He stoutly
   denied it, there being several allusions in it stronger than he cared to
   stand sponsor for.

   In England, Franklin was accused of being the author, and he neither
   denied nor admitted it. But when a lady reproached him for having used the
   fine alliterative phrase, applied to the King, "That Royal British Brute,"
   he smiled and said blandly,
    
   Madame, I would never have been as disrespectful to the brute creation as
   that.
    
   Common Sense struck the keynote of popular feeling, and the
   accusation of "treason", hurled at it from many sources, only served to
   advertise it.  It supplied the common people with reasons and gave
   statesmen arguments. The Legislature of Pennsylvania voted Paine an
   honorarium of $3,000.00, and the University of Pennsylvania awarded him
   the degree of "Master of Arts" in recognition of eminent service to
   literature and human rights.

   John Quincy Adams said, Paine's pamphlet, Common Sense, crystallized 
   public opinion and was the first factor in bringing about the Revolution.

   Reverend Theodore Parker once said: Every living man in America in 1776 
   who could read, read Common Sense, by Thomas Paine. lf he were a Tory he 
   read it, at least a little, just to find out for himself how atrocious 
   it was; and if he was a Whig he read it all to find the reasons why he 
   was one. This book was the arsenal to which Colonists went for their 
   mental weapons. When independence was declared, Paine enlisted as a 
   private, but was soon made aide-de-camp to General Greene. He was an 
   intrepid and effective soldier and took an active part in various battles.

   In December, 1776, he published his second work, The American Crisis,
   the first words  of which have gone into the electrotype of human speech:
    
   These are the times that try men's souls.
    
   The intent of The American Crisis was to infuse courage into the sinking
   spirits of the soldiers. Washington ordered the pamphlet read at the head
   of every regiment, and it was so done. Then followed many other numbers of
   The American Crisis- all to aid the patriotic cause. On June 8, 1780,
   Paine started a subscription-list, and headed it with $500.00, all the
   money he had, to feed Washington's starving army. The total subscribed was
   a little over $1,500,000.00. This sum averted disaster until the loan was
   secured from France.

   The Rights of Man was Paine's third great work. The Age of Reason was
   the last volume given to the world by this great thinker.
    
                                       II
                                        
   Every American should acquaint himself with the career of Thomas Paine,
   patriot, philosopher, statesman, liberator, and humanitarian. Had Paine
   given to the world nothing more than that matchless phrase which he
   adopted as his motto,
    
   The world is my country; to do good is my religion,
    
   I should still feel that he was indeed entitled to a supernal position in
   the Galleries of Fame. The breadth of Paine's soul may be measured in his
   splendid retort when Franklin remarked,
    
   Where liberty is, there is my home.
    
   Paine replied,
    
   Where liberty is not, there is my home.
    
   Liberty was Paine's keynote. As early as 1775, 88 years before Lincoln's
   emancipation proclamation, Paine published an eloquent appeal in behalf of
   the negro slave. He advocated the immediate abolishment of the system of 
   human bondage. Paine also wrote in favor of universal peace and an end to 
   all war and militarism. Had Paine's wise counsel been heeded and slavery 
   abolished at the Birth of the American Republic, the Civil War, with its 
   frightful toll of more than 500,000 lives sacrificed, would had been averted. 
   Had the world heeded Paine's advice, the great European War of 1914 and all 
   other wars since Paine's time, would never have taken place.

   Among Paine's writings on the subject of war occurs this fine passage:
    
   When we consider the calamities of war and the miseries it inflicts
   upon the human species, the thousands and tens of thousands, of every age and sex,
   who are rendered wretched by the event, surely there is something in the heart
   of  man that calls upon him to think! Surely, there is some tender chord,
   tuned by  the hand of the Creator, that still struggles to emit in the hearing of
   the soul a note of sorrowing sympathy.

   Let it then be heard and let man learn to feel that the true greatness of
   a nation is founded on principles of humanity, and not on conquest.
   War involves in its progress such a train of unforeseen and unsupposed
   circumstances, such a combination of foreign matters, that no human wisdom
   can calculate the end. lt has but one thing certain, and that is to
   increase taxes.

   I defend the cause of the poor, of the manufacturer, of the tradesman,of
   the farmer, and of all those on whom the real burden of taxes falls-but,
   above all, I defend the cause of women and children-of all humanity.
    
                                      III
                                        
   Ease, fluidity, grace, imagination, energy, earnestness, mark Paine's
   work. No wonder is it that Franklin said,
    
   Others can rule, many can fight, but only Paine can write for us the
   English tongue.
    
   And Jefferson, himself a great writer, was constantly, for many years,
   sending to Paine manuscript for criticism and correction. In one letter to
   Paine, Jefferson adds this postscript:
    
   You [PaineJ must not be too much elated and set up when I tell you my
   belief that you are the only writer in America who can write better than your
   obliged and obedient servant-Thomas Jefferson.
    
   Paine published in England in 1791 and 1792 The Rights of Man. Parts I and
   II, the greatest revolutionary political treatises ever written. Paine was 
   outlawed by the government of that day, was also burnt in effigy for his 
   pains. The thinking men of England now revere the memory of Thomas Paine 
   for his great work in the nation's behalf. The most important of the many 
   reforms England has undertaken in the century that has elapsed since it 
   outlawed Paine have been brought about by Paine's mastery work.

   In 1794, Paine published his The Age of Reason - considered by many
   persons to be the most vital of all Paine's works. Upon this theological
   treatise is founded all modern biblical criticism. The clergy nowadays
   frequently quote this book, but seldom indeed do they credit the source of
   their quotations.

   For writing The Age of Reason - Paine, a deeply religious man, but a
   thinker who rejected the so-called religion that was popular, was branded
   an atheist. Only in recent years, and very largely through the work of The
   Thomas Paine National Historical Association, has the world come to an
   understanding  and appreciation of Paine.
    
                                       IV
                                        
   There have been many prevarications concerning Paine by press and pulpit
   and those who profess a life of love, meekness, and humility. But we
   should remember that all this vilification is really the tribute that
   mediocrity pays genius. To escape censure one only has to move with the
   mob, think with the mob, do nothing that the mob does not do-then you are
   safe. The saviors of the world have usually been crucified between
   thieves, despised, forsaken, spat upon, rejected of men. Socrates
   poisoned, Aristides ostracized, Aristotle fleeing for his life, Jesus
   crucified, Paul beheaded, Peter crucified head downward, Savonarola
   martyred, Spinoza hunted, tracked, and cursed and an order issued that no
   man should speak to him nor supply him food or shelter, Bruno burned,
   Galileo imprisoned Huss, Wycliffe (or Wyclif), Latimer, and Tyndale used
   for kindling -  all this in the name of religion, institutional religion,
   the one thing that has caused more misery, heartache, bloodshed, war, than
   all other causes combined.

   Men who know history and humanity and have reasonably open minds are
   not surprised at the treatment visited upon Paine by the country he had so
   much benefited. Paine got off easy; he lived his life, and expressed
   himself freely to the last. Men who discover continents are destined to
   die in chains. That is the price they pay for sailing on, and on, and on,
   and on.

   The pen of Paine made the sword of Washington possible. And as
   Paine's book, Common Sense, broke the power of Great Britain in America,
   and the Rights of Man gave freespeech and a free press to England, so did
   The Age of Reason give pause to the juggernautof orthodoxy. Paine blazed
   the way and made it possible for men to preach the sweetreasonableness of
   reason. He was the pioneer in a jungle of superstition.
