   From the Time of Their Disinternment in 1819.

   by William Cobbett, M.P.

   Down to Year 1846.

   [Edited by J. Watson, 3, Queen's Head Passage, Paternoster Row, London,
   1847]

   With the life and writings of this celebrated man we have nothing to do in
   this little work, which is merely to be a concise history of his mortal
   remains, subsequent to the disinternmant of them by the late WILLIAM
   COBBETT.

   It may be well just to state here, en passat, that Mr. PAINE was born in
   Thetford, in Norfolk, January 29, 1736[sic], that he died at Greenwich,
   near New York, June 8, 1809, and that he was buried at New Rochelle, about
   twenty miles from that city.

   Mr. Paine, in his will, expresses a wish to be buried in the Quakers'
   burial-ground; but, that people refused to grant permission for compliance
   with this desire of his. On this subject, Mr. Cobbett says: -

   "Mr. PAINE was the only man of distinguished talent ever produced amongst
   the Society of Quakers. His wish was to be buried in the Quakers'
   burying-ground, at New York. This wish was expressed, I believe, to Mr.
   WILLET HICKS, of that city. And what was the reason on which the Quakers
   founded their objection? Why this; that there were many who accused them
   of deism already; and that if they buried him in their ground, the
   accusation would have a circumstance to rest on. The reason was
   very mean, to say the best of it; and all the Quakers that I have talked
   with upon the subject, in America, will acknowledge that I reproached them
   with their cowardice; with their want of all feeling of honour; with their
   casting from them the only great man that their sect ever produced."

   In London, there is a society formed for the purpose of collecting funds,
   for raising a monument to the memory of Mr. Paine, and the committee,
   appointed for managing the affair, have lately issued an address to the
   public, in which there is a mistake which all would wish to see rectified,
   It is as follows:

   PAINE'S MONUMENT

   "You, the people of England", say the committee, "have all heard of Thomas
   Paine, the author of the `Rights of Man', who went over to America, where
   his book, entitled `Common Sense', roused the dormant spirit of the people
   to declare their independence, and to shake off the British yoke. Having
   witnessed the successful effect of his doctrine in the `New World', he
   returned to his native country, in the hope of producing a like effect
   here. With this view he published his `Rights of Man', but a bigoted and
   tyrannical government had too strong an influence over society to permit
   the success of free and enlightened opinions at that time, and Paine went
   over to France, to assist in the revolution. There he strove, but in vain,
   to soften the sanguinary spirit which was endangering the cause of
   liberty. He afterwards retired to America, the land of his adoption, where
   he died. The bones of Major Andre, the spy, and Cooke, the actor, having
   been removed to England, for the purpose of re-internment in their native
   soil, with public honours, the idea suggested itself to Mr. Cobbett, who
   was at that time an exile in America - whither he had fled from the
   persecution of Sidmouth and Castereagh - that it would be a shame if the
   remains of Paine were left behind; and he therefore caused them to be
   exhumed, and to be brought to England, in the hope that he should be able
   to induce the admirers of disinterested patriotism, to concur in his
   design of paying due respect to the memory of that illustrious patriot and
   philanthropist. Cobbett was obliged, however, to abandon his design, and
   the committee now call upon the people - whom they consider the proper
   parties to carry such a design into effect - to come forward and
   accomplish it. The Americans," they say, "have erected a national monument
   to the author of `Common Sense'; and we trust that Englishmen, who are
   under not less obligations to the author of the `Rights of Man', will show
   their gratitude with their usual generosity and nobleness of spirit."

   ****

   Now, with regard to the disinterment, this is not chronologically correct;
   as the bones of Mr. PAINE were exhumed, we believe, before those of Mr.
   COOKE, the actor, (which, by the bye, we believe, were never disinterred,
   but had a monument erected over them by Kean, the great tragic actor, when
   he was in America), but certainly before those of the spy, ANDRE, were.
   Mr. Paine's remains were disinterred about Sept. 1819, as will be seen by
   a paragraph, in COBBETT'S REGISTER, vol. xxxv, p. 382, which he dates
   from Long Island, New York, and which says, "I have just done here a
   thing, which I have always, since I came to the country, vowed that I
   would do: that is, taken up the remains of our famous
   countryman, PAINE, in order to convey them to England. The Quakers, even
   the Quakers refused him a grave! And I found him lying in the corner of a
   rugged, barren field! * * * Our expedition set out from new York, in the
   middle of the night; got to the place (twenty-two miles off) at peep of
   day; took up the coffin entire; brought it off to New York; and just as we
   found it, it goes to England. Let it be considered the act of the
   Reformers of England, Scotland, and Ireland. In their name we opened the
   grave, and in their name will the tomb be raised."

   Now, the first announcement that we had of the exhumation of the bones of
   the spy, ANDRE, is from the "New York National Advocate", of July, 25,
   1821, (nearly two years after the disinterring of the remains of Mr.
   Paine), the account given in that paper is as follows: - "The Duke of
   York, in compliance with the suggestion of the British Consul in this
   city, has ordered him to cause the remains of the late MAJOR ANDRE to be
   disinterred and sent in a ship-of-war to England, to be buried in
   Westminster Abbey." On this Mr. Cobbett says, "Well, then, if this be
   true, all the difference between me and the Duke of York is, that I bring
   home the bones of an Englishman, famed throughout the world for his
   talents and writings, and who died a natural death; and that the Duke
   brings home the bones of the one who was hanged as a spy." - Cobbett's
   Register, vol. xl, p. 546.

   Mr. COBBETT, when in early life, as a political writer, in Philadelphia,
   was a great opponent of Mr. PAINE's writings and principles; yet he wrote
   in such a manner as to excite some degree of admiration, even from Mr.
   PAINE, who, in one of his letters, speaks of him as a wit and a man
   of talent. Well then, we will just quote here a few sentences from Mr.
   COBBETT, showing his more matured and unprejudiced opinion of his quondam
   political opponent was. He says, - "In principles of finance Mr. PAINE was
   deeply skilled; and to his very great and rare talents as a writer, he
   added an uncommon degree of experience in the concerns of paper-money, the
   rise and fall of which he had witnessed in the United States and
   in France. * * Events have proved the truth of his principles on this
   subject, and to point out the fact is no more than an act of justice, due
   to his talents, and an act more particularly due at my hands, I having
   been one of his most violent assailants. Any man may fall into error, but
   a fool or a knave will seldom acknowledge it." - Paper against Gold.

   Addressing Lord Folkstone, (now Radnor,) he says, - "Read PAINE, my Lord,
   read the essay (Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance,) of
   this famous Englishman; this true Englishman; this son of the `Lower
   Orders'; this honour to his country and the human mind * * * PAINE was
   described, by the base BURKE, as a traitor and a rebel. This wretch, when
   defeated by our brother PAINE, called upon the Attorney-General to defend
   him against his vanquisher! The call was obeyed; PAINE fled to France from
   the fangs of the bloody monsters. He never again set his foot on the land
   of his birth, and to which he was so great an honour." - Cobbett's
   Register, vol. xxxiv, p. 991.

   Again, - "Old age having laid his hand upon this truly great man,
   this truly philosophical politician, at his expiring flambeau I lighted my
   taper." - Ibid., vol. xxxv, p. 724.

   And, in the same volume, Mr. COBBETT says, "I saw PAINE first pointing the
   way, and then leading a nation through perils and difficulties of all
   sorts, to independence and to lasting liberty, prosperity and greatness."

   Another extract and we have done. "Jefferson, and some others, have had
   the credit of being the authors of the Declaration of Independence of
   America. Either of them, for aught I know, may have written it; but PAINE
   was its AUTHOR." Vol. lxviii, p. 60.

   We could greatly add to the above, by other quotations by the same author,
   but our limits forbid; we must, therefore, continue our self-appointed
   task.

   Mr. COBBETT landed at Liverpool, from America, November 21, 1819, with
   these remains in his possession; where they remained down to the time of
   his death (except during a short time that he placed them in the keeping
   of a well known friend of his in Hampshire), and we have now to trace them
   down to the present time (1846) into the possession of Mr. B. TILLY, of
   No. 13, Bedford Square, East, London, who has had them in his care since
   March, 1844, and who, having had opportunities for seeing them, whilst in
   Mr. Cobbett's hands, can verify them as being the identical ones that Mr.
   C had as the undoubted and genuine remains of Mr. PAINE. He has, also, the
   coffin-plate that was taken up with them, on which, though much corroded,
   may be seen the following inscription. "THOMAS PAINE, died June 8, 1809,
   aged 74 years."

   On the death of Mr. Cobbett, which took place, June 18, 1835, at
   Normandy-farm, near Farnham, Surrey; his eldest son, being sole executor,
   of course had possession of the farm, at Normandy; and, amongst the things
   there, were the remains of Mr. Paine, in an old trunk, which was packed
   and sealed up by Mr. Tilly, in January, 1833, and sent by him from Bolt
   Court, London, to Normandy-farm, where they had remained down to the death
   of Mr. Cobbett; and, after his death, his eldest son inscribed his name in
   several places on the skull and on most of the larger bones of the limbs,
   in order, we suppose, to the more easy verifications of them in case of
   doubt or dispute, and which inscriptions are now visible on them.

   Well, then, we have now traced them down to the possession of Mr.
   COBBETT Junior; and, having made good our ground thus far, we will
   continue our narrative, which will not cost us much time or trouble, But
   to do this succinctly, it will be necessary to state that, within a few
   weeks, after the death of Mr. COBBETT, this gentleman, (his son and
   executor), was arrested for a debt of his own, and totally unconnected
   with the estate of his late father; and, that, whilst under the pressure
   of all the harassing circumstances connected with an action for debt, one
   JESSE OLDFIELD, who had been a shopman to Mr. COBBETT for about a year and
   a half, appeared before the public as a creditor of the estate, to the
   amount of many hundreds of pounds! And filed a bill in Chancery, charging
   Mr. C. Jun., with insolvency and with a design not to pay his father's
   debts. This took place in July, 1835, about one month after the death of
   Mr. COBBETT. On the 1st of August following, OLDFIELD obtained an
   injunction against Mr. C. Jun., restraining him from interfering or
   intermeddling with the estate, and for appointing a receiver and manager
   thereto. On the 18th of August a receiver was appointed in the person of
   Mr. GEORGE WEST, a farmer, living at Normandy, on a farm adjoining that of
   the late Mr. COBBETT. This receiver, as a matter of course, took
   possession of the property at the farm, consisting of the live and dead
   stock, implements of husbandry, crops of corn, hay, seeds, household
   furniture, &c.; and amongst the various things, thus committed to his
   care, was the box containing the remains of Mr. PAINE; which, when the
   effects of the late Mr. COBBETT were publicly sold in January, 1836, were
   brought forward to the auctioneer for him to put them up for sale! This he
   would not do. They were, therefore, withdrawn and retained in the
   possession of the receiver to await orders of the LORD CHANCELLOR, who, on
   the subject being mentioned to him in Court, refused to recognize them as
   part of the estate, or to make any order respecting them. They were,
   therefore, left for the receiver to do whatever he chose with them; but,
   he determined to retain them in his possession as long as the receivership
   lasted; from which he was finally relieved in 1839; from which time, down
   to the month of March, 1844, he continued to hold them, to ascertain
   whether the creditors of the estate, to which he had been so long the
   receiver, would relieve him of them; but as none of them had ever made any
   inquiry about them, and as no other person had any semblance of right to
   them, he considered that he had a perfect right to get rid of them in any
   way that he pleased. He was, also, in his old age, and with a very
   numerous and young family, just then compelled to leave his little farm
   and to become a farming day-labourer. Every one can easily conceive the
   impossibility of such relics being preserved by such a man and under such
   circumstances; and, having ascertained that Mr. TILLY, whom he had long
   known, had expressed a desire that Mr. COBBETT's intentions, regarding
   them, should be carried into effect, he, therefore, in March, 1844, (after
   they had been in his hands nearly nine years), conveyed them to London,
   and gave them into the possession of Mr. Tilly; by whom they have since
   been kept; and by whom they will, in all probability, be kept, until a
   public funeral of them can be arranged. On this subject Mr. COBBETT said,
   when he brought them to England: - "If it please God to give us life, we
   will have a funeral worthy of the remains that are to be buried. I do not
   say when this shall take place; but it shall be, if I live, in a season
   when twenty wagon-loads of flowers can be brought to strew the road before
   the hearse."

   In closing this brief account, we will present our readers with the
   forcible and elegant tribute, to the character, talents, and worth of
   THOMAS PAINE, by the celebrated and eloquent CHARLES PHILLIPS, in his work
   called the "Loves of Celestine and St. Albert." It is as follows: - "Among
   these there was one whom I could not help viewing with peculiar
   admiration, because, by the sole power of surprising genius, he had
   surmounted the disadvantages of birth, and the difficulties of fortune. It
   was the celebrated THOMAS PAINE; a man, who, no matter what may be the
   difference of opinion as to his principles, must ever remain a proud
   example of mind, unpatronised and unsupported, eclipsing the factitious
   beams of rank, and wealth, and pedigree! I never saw him in his captivity,
   nor heard the revilings with which he has since been assailed, without
   cursing in my heart that ungenerous feeling, which, cold to the
   necessities of genius, is clamorous in the publication of its defects. Ye
   great ones of his nation! Ye pretended moralists! So forward now to cast
   your interested indignation upon the memory of PAINE, where were you in
   the day of his adversity! which of you, to assist his infant merit, would
   diminish even the surplus of your debaucheries! Where the mitred charity!
   The practical religion! Consistent declaimers, rail on! What, though his
   genius was the gift of heaven, his heart the altar of friendship! What,
   though wit and eloquence and antecdote flowed freely from his tongue:
   while conviction made his voice her messenger! What, though thrones
   trembled, and prejudice fled, and freedom came at his command! He dared to
   question the creed which you, believing, contradicted; and to despise
   the rank which you, boasting of, debased."

   Finally, it is to be hoped that the time is not far distant when such a
   funeral shall take place: such a monument be raised and such honours done
   to these sacred remains, as will show that the people of the present age,
   casting caut, hypocrisy, prejudice, and ingratitude from them, can
   appreciate the sterling worth of the great mind that once animated these
   interesting relics of that " NOBLE OF NATURE", THOMAS PAINE.

   THE END
