   To the Editor of SCRIBNER'S MONTHLY:

    SIR: The extensive circulation of SCRIBNER'S MONTHLY may, I hope, be
   sufficient reason for your allowing me to correct a statement in your
   columns which is likely to produce a false impression.

   The statement for which I complain is in the following sentence, at page
   32 of the number for November, 1880, volume XXI., number I, article
   "Bordentown and the Bonapartes": "His (Paine's) favorite resort was the
   bar-room of the Washington House, and the visitors to that ancient
   hostelry are told that nothing but brandy and atheism passed his lips."
   This is said to have been "during a period of several years"; and nothing
   in the context alters the bearing of the sentence. Of course I cannot
   dispute the statement of such tales being told to the Washington-House
   visitors: I only deny the truth of the tales.

   Paine was neither brandy-drinker (implied drunkard) nor atheist. Against
   the atheism his own works are sufficient evidence. Throughout his
   writings, especially in the "Age of Reason" and his "Thoughts on a Future
   State", is proof that, although not a believer in Christianity or the
   Bible, he was a steady theist, - what in those days was known as a deist,
   - as distinct from the Unitarian, who accepts the authority while denying
   the divinity of Christ. In his will, Paine expressly directs that his
   adopted sons shall be instructed in their duty to God."

   For his brandy-bibbing there is as little warrant as for the atheism. I
   have before me a letter of his, to a friend intending to visit him (it is
   dated some years later than the bar-room period, but there is no record of
   any variation in his habits), in which he says:

   "When you come you must take such fare as you meet with, for I live upon
   tea, milk, fruit, pies, plain dumplings, and a piece of meat when I get
   it; but I live with that retirement and quiet that suits me."

   In truth, these aspersions of atheism and brandy, like the insolent
   appellation "Tom Paine" (to which even your contributor stoops, though he
   does not write Joe Hopkinson nor Jack Adams), deliberately intended to
   cloak him with an atmosphere of vulgarity, are but proofs of the reckless
   blackguardism of polemical writers of Paine's time. It is not at the
   present more courteous day, at least not in America, that the author of
   "Common Sense" should be so treated.

   Forty years ago I was employed to write Paine's "Life". Knowing nothing of
   the man, I was careful to examine everything I could find for or against
   him. I was also in communication with men who had known him personally. I
   found him to be that typical Englishman, honest, courageous, and constant,
   a lover of justice, a man of the real Old and New England stamp, religious
   according to his light, it may be pugnacious in attacking what to him
   seemed error, but at least more tolerant than his opponents, benevolent,
   and generous. Born of the lower classes, with only a grammar-school
   education, he must have made something of himself, must have also acquired
   some decency of behavior, to become the friend of Franklin, Jefferson, and
   Lafayette, and for a time the companion of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, living
   in the same house with him in Paris. Of him, Lord Edward writes, October
   30, 1792, no such great while after the accustomed visits to the
   Bordentown bar:

   "I lodge with my friend Paine. We breakfast, dine, and sup together. The
   more I see of his interior, the more I like and respect him. I cannot
   express how kind he is to me. There is a simplicity of manners, a goodness
   of heart, and a strength of mind in him that I never knew a man before
   possess."

   So also Colonel Burr, who knew him after his return to America; and who
   replied to an inquirer as to Paine's habits (it was the inquirer himself
   who informed me), "Sir, he dined at my table"; adding: "I always
   considered Mr. Paine a gentleman, a pleasant companion, and a good-natured
   and intelligent man; decidedly temperate, with a proper regard to his
   personal appearance, whenever I saw him."
   
   Yes; this man, still pointed out to abhorrence as a coarse, brawling,
   brandy-tippling reviler of religion, was indeed a gentleman, a high-souled
   man of genius and philanthropic purpose, a man of remarkable probity and
   disinterestedness, a notably good man; and known now in the mud flung at
   him by calumniators, and heaped again by those who care not to learn the
   truth concerning him.
                                                                                                                                      
   W.J. Linton
