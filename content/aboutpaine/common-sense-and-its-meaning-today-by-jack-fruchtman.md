   .
        Americans like many other people are lovers of anniversaries,
   especially when there is a zero or a five at the end of the heralded date
   (which is maybe why we celebrated the millennium in 2000 rather than
   2001). Thomas Paine's first real splash in the public eye occurred when
   his Common Sense appeared 225 years ago on January 10, 1776, a date which,
   we must remember, was nearly six months before Jefferson drafted the
   Declaration of Independence. In many respects, Paine was ahead of his
   compatriots in demanding separation from Britain. In any case, it is easy
   to argue that while many Americans talked among themselves of
   independence, Paine was the first to write about it in clear, lucid,
   stirring terms that were immediately accessible to anyone who either read
   his pamphlet or had it read to them.

        Now I have been accused of citing Paine too much to comment on modern
   social and political problems. Some folks hold that historical figures
   obviously lived in particular periods, spoke a language that was peculiar
   to their time and place, and that the role of the historian is to try to
   figure out the intentions and meaning of their language on their terms,
   not ours. In other words, they say, you cannot take a person from his
   historical context, move him into the twenty-first century and expect to
   have him say reasonable things about our problems and issues. Well, in
   fact, they are right: I have found what I claim to be "a usable Paine," as
   they charge, and will continue to use his wisdom, his observations, and
   his approach to problem-solving until they are no longer usable.

        So what does Common Sense tell us today 225 years after its first
   appearance in this city-when America's relationships with Britain were
   seriously deteriorating? Certainly, we have no such problems with Britain
   today. Indeed, we have no such problems with any nation. There is no doubt
   that the United States of America (a term that I still say Paine coined in
   the second essay in his American Crisis series, despite the arguments by
   William Safire of the New York Times) is the strongest country in the
   world from an economic and military perspective.2 What we may not be is
   the most ethical, and this is the lesson we may first learn from Paine's
   work.

        First. what is "common sense" and how do we know what it is when we
   see it (as Potter Stewart said of pornography in 1964)?3 Here's story that
   while Paine did not use it. He would have, had he known it. A knight was
   riding through a forest one day when he came upon an arrow right in the
   middle of bull's eye in a tree. Since this was not particularly unusual,
   he didn't think much of it, but he became increasingly astounded when he 
   came across several of them. They must have numbered ten or fifteen, and 
   each arrow was perfectly centered in the bull's eye. At last the knight came
   upon a young boy with a bow and arrow, and so he asked the lad whether he
   had been the one who had shot all those arrows. The boy answered, yes, it
   was he who had done the deed. But how did you learn to do it so well,
   asked the knight. The boy replied that he used common sense: he simply
   first shot the arrow into the tree, and then painted the target around it.
   . . . This is not because he was either lazy or unskilled, but that he
   just used "common sense."

        If only everything could be so clear.

        For Paine, one thing was in fact clear (and a reflection of common
   sense): he knew that human beings had a "natural love of liberty."4 And he
   knew too that people considered "freedom as personal property," property
   of which no person could deprive others without violating nature.5  These
   phrases are Paine's (though not from Common Sense, but rather from his
   later writings in 1778 and 1782). The problem for Americans in 1776 was
   how to capitalize on these two observations, which he drew from common
   sense? How should (or could) he make them realize that there really was no
   longer any alternative to separation?

        His response was to figure out a way to tell them just that in
   irrefutable and indeed absolutist terms. He did just that by arguing in
   ways that immediately grabbed their attention. Fewer words during the
   revolutionary era are greater than these from his great pamphlet (though
   I'd argue that maybe some of Jefferson's in the Declaration come close):
   "We have it in our power to begin the world over again" and "now is the
   seed-time of continental union, faith, and honor."6  His intention was
   clear: to move America forward toward independence, and to do it now. More
   often than not, he thought that it took a great man, one actually like
   himself, Thomas Paine, to stimulate them to act. When this reawakening
   happened, they exercised "common sense."

        Some commentators have defined common sense as being coequal with a
   person's moral powers.7 This interpretation, though essentially correct,
   is incomplete. Common sense was certainly part of human affections, our
   innate moral sensibilities. But common sense also included our ability to
   reason. Now, Paine was no epistemologist. He never set forth a lucid,
   cogent argument, as for example had Locke or Hume, to determine how the
   mind operated or how man knew anything at all. But he did have definitive
   ideas about how people knew how to conduct their lives. They do so through
   both their affections and their reason-through passion and reason.

        Paine was not the first writer to use the phrase common sense as a
   faculty for understanding, nor was he the first to use it as a corollary
   to human moral sensibilities. Lord Shaftesbury though clearly an elitist,
   had, as did the eighteenth-century Scottish Common Sense philosophers,
   such as Thomas Reid.  Although these philosophers' works were available to
   him, Paine probably never read Shaftesbury's Characteristicks (1711) or
   Reid's Inquiry (1764). Even so, common sense, as a sensory faculty, a kind
   of sixth sense, encapsulated his idea of what a natural human being was
   and ought to be.8  The term was well known and obviously in broad usage at
   the end of the eighteenth century, including America.

        For Shaftesbury, Reid, and Paine, common sense was an
   all-encompassing faculty of mind and feeling that gave people the power of
   immediate discernment.9 The Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid observed that
   common sense forced him to "to take my own existence, and the existence of
   other things upon trust," and to believe that snow was cold and honey
   sweet.10  These things were knowable spontaneously when people first
   encountered them. For the skeptic to deny this phenomenon undermined the
   true basis of human knowledge.

        But how did common sense operate? Although epistemologically vague,
   Paine used it to express both reason and sensibility.11 Common sense was
   the means by which the mind understood the way the heart felt about
   reality. It had nothing to do with abstract reasoning or metaphysical
   concepts. It was wholly empirical, since it was based only on sensory
   perceptions. After all, the Americans did not need abstract ideas of
   freedom to convince them that the British oppressed them. They needed only
   to listen to the dictates of their common sense. As Paine noted, "common
   sense will tell us."12  It will tell us because the powers of the mind and
   the heart are like lightning bolts of spontaneous discernment. The mind
   knew and the heart felt that "however our eyes may be dazzled with snow,
   or our ears deceived by sound; however prejudice may warp our wills, or
   interest darken our understanding, the simple voice of nature and our
   reason will say, it is right."13 To see how this works, it is imperative,
   in short, to analyze the linguistic and epistemological roots of the
   expression common sense.

        First, common sense by necessity included a person's ability to
   reason. As Paine said in The Age of Reason, "the most formidable weapon
   against errors of every kind is reason. I have never used any other, and I
   trust I never shall."14 As for America's relationship to England prior to
   1776, "it is repugnant to reason. . . to suppose that this continent can
   longer remain subject to any external power."15 Indeed, he once declared
   that the new era of politics in which he lived was "the age of
   reason."16  Paine did not say it was "the age of common sense!" And of
   course, he named one of his books with that very title. Common sense was,
   therefore, clearly a function of man's rational capabilities, his ability
   to reason.

        But common sense included affection as well. It did not feel right to
   men, that relationship with Britain, because it violated their moral
   sensibilities. All one must do to gauge whether the colonies ought to
   remain linked to Britain was to judge the relationship by "those feelings
   and affections which nature justifies.. . . Examine the passions and
   feelings of mankind," he said, and judge that relationship by the
   standards that nature supplied.17 During the war with Britain, as the
   military situation deteriorated, "what we have to do," said Paine, "is as
   clear as light, and the way to do it as straight as a line."18 This light
   - this clarity - was what common sense provided to people. Such clarity,
   if one could follow one's true nature, gave them two options.

        First, they could achieve positive political and social changes. They
   would know by both reason and affection, what was right, what was wrong in
   society and government. Second, common sense was the vehicle for people's
   inventiveness. As common sense informed them when and how to make or
   invent revolutions, by extension it was also the creative spark that moved
   them to enhance progress. Human inventions improved life for everyone.
   When Paine was struggling with the design of his iron bridge, he realized
   he had to moderate his "ambition with a little 'common sense' in order to
   make the necessary modifications."19 It was a powerful turn of phrase that
   Paine undoubtedly knew would deeply impress his wide American audience.

        Every person, he taught, possessed common sense. The problem was that
   it became impaired when brute force enslaved the people, when kings and
   lords (ruffians and their banditti) made their subjects do their will.20
   They deprived them of their freedom to choose, and they destroyed or badly
   compromised their sense of self. When that happened, common sense was
   distorted. People no longer thought straight (as a line), and nothing was
   clear (as light). Such force had a numbing effect on their minds and
   hearts. They might never even feel the pain of that force and might never
   be aware of it.

        This state of affairs violated man's nature as a creature with the
   ability to reason. "Men," said Paine, "have a right to reason for
   themselves."21 When kings and their cohorts stole this right from their
   subjects, these subjects were no longer whole persons. They were slaves,
   the puppets of others who used them as they saw fit. They lost their sense
   of self and became objects-indeed, the property-of others. For Paine,
   human beings universally shared this same nature. How then did he explain
   that some men like himself were indeed different?

        Here Paine used his natural vs. unnatural theme in a linguistically
   powerful way, convincing his readers, though with an argument less certain
   to persuade those more philosophically inclined. He defined the
   characteristics of the thieves of common sense and human freedom by
   virtually defining them out of humanity itself. These denatured creatures
   were usurpers, these kings, these aristocrats, their followers, and later
   the Federalists, too. They were unable to use their natural powers of
   common sense. Their desire for dominance and violence proscribed them from
   living a life of reason and moral affection. "A mind habituated to actions
   of meanness and injustice, commits them without reflection, or with a very
   partial one," he told the Abby Raynal just a few years later.22 They
   relied only on their basest instincts, not common sense, to seek power
   over others. Thus, base instinct (in this case, seeking power and
   dominion) opposed common sense (reason and sensibility).

        The British government, especially George III (whom he never
   specifically named in Common Sense because his target was kingship
   generally and not individual kings), was such a creature. He once noted in
   regard to the king's cabinet that a universal human characteristic was the
   inability to change once intellectual patterns and habits were firmly set.
   "Once the mind loses the sense of its own dignity," he said to Raynal, "it
   loses, likewise, the ability of judging it in another."23 Several years
   later, while in France, Paine modified his view when he advocated that
   Louis XVI's life be spared. But in 1776, the Americans had no choice.24

        The British government had failed to use its collective common sense
   to deal fairly with the Americans. Such a failure meant that Britain
   distorted America's well-being because the British viewed the Americans in
   Britain's own image. Addressing Raynal again, Paine wrote that "the
   American war has thrown Britain into such a variety of absurd situations,
   that, in arguing from herself she sees not in what conduct national
   dignity consists in other countries."25 For the same reason, the British
   wanted to plunder the Dutch. They figured that the Netherlands would never
   resist them, only to find themselves eventually at war anyway. Once a
   nation no longer used common sense, no matter what that nation did, its
   actions were illogical, wrong, and immoral. Its actions defied, in short,
   its natural inclination to do good. This was both affectively and
   rationally true.

        Common sense was in part rooted in a person's affective nature
   because implanted in him were "unextinguishable feelings" to do good.
   These feelings, he wrote in Common Sense, "distinguish us from the herd of
   common animals," he said. "Otherwise, the social compact would dissolve,
   and justice be extirpated from the earth, or have only a casual
   existence."26 Man's affections drove him into the social realm in the
   first place. This was a result of common sense. He lived with his fellows
   in a cooperative arrangement for the benefit of all.

        A social contract existed between men outside the realm of the
   sovereign and his lords. "There necessarily was a time when government did
   not exist, and consequently there could exist no governors to form such a
   compact with."27 Although Paine did not identify Locke explicitly, his
   language describing the social contract was Lockean, and he was never
   loathe giving a Lockean lesson.28 "The fact therefore must be, that the
   individuals themselves, each in his own personal and sovereign right,
   entered into a compact with each other to produce a government: and this
   is the only mode in which governments have a right to arise, and the only
   principle on which they have a right to exist."29 A man was fully
   conscious of the self in this decision-making so that he consciously came
   together with his fellows to form society for reasons having to do with
   his natural affections toward others.

        As he wrote of these "unextinguishable feelings" and the historic
   ideal of the social contract, he knew full well that George III and his
   ministry did not possess such feelings and never would, nor would they
   ever fully understand the implications of the contract. They felt no sense
   of justice because they were in fact different. Common sense informed the
   Americans that a continued relationship with Britain was doomed. "To talk
   of friendship with those in whom our reason forbids us to have faith . . .
   is madness and folly", i.e., it was against reason and sensibility.30 The
   people themselves must use their common sense to assert their right to
   participate in governmental decision-making.

        Monarchical government in England had distorted the proper
   relationship between the people and their government. This distortion
   arose because common sense was lacking. Kings and lords and people like
   them were inhuman. He avoided having to clarify why he thought human
   nature was universal by literally reading them out of the human race. It
   was a powerful argument to hear, one linguistically encapsulated in a
   highly didactic, imperative tone, even if it were logically bewildering to
   read of a human being who lacked human nature. Then again, Paine was not
   addressing an audience of philosophers, but rather an audience of lower
   and middle class Americans who, he thought, would respond to this imagery
   in a way that would convince them to support America's separation from
   Britain.

        So now, what does all this tell us today? How does Paine's great
   pamphlet speak to us in the twenty-first century? The answer is not hard
   to fathom, and it will lead us directly to the reasons why Philadelphia
   should honor Thomas Paine. First, let's look at how he might evaluate the
   latest folly of the American people, the election of George W. Bush to the
   presidency of the United States. And we need not look far. Among the many
   famous lines in Common Sense appears these: "Society in every state is a
   blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil;
   in its worst state an intolerable one."31 I think we may safely say that
   while we will not have the worst possible government for the next four
   years, we will have one that Paine would have absolutely adored because it
   would have given him such fodder for his literary cannon (and I do mean
   with the double "n") to attack for its misaligned policies. And to have a
   know-nothing president, a man who has probably never read a book much less
   a newspaper, and who has to rely on advisors to make decisions because his
   knowledge is so weak is something Paine would have found both amusing and
   maddening. Here is a president without common sense, without any
   understanding at all, and who could do only mischief in office.

        Even worse is the mixture, or what he would have called the
   admixture, of politics and religion. John Ashcroft has told his audience
   at Bob Jones University that Jesus is the king of America. For Paine, this
   is pure arrogance (and of course absolutely wrong). Even in 1776 when we
   might say that there was a pinch of faith still ingrained in Paine's
   heart, he never argued, like Ashcroft, that Jesus is the king of America.
   In fact, it was the opposite: "the world may know, that . . . in American
   THE LAW IS KING. For as in absolute government the King is law, so in free
   countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other."32
   Ashcroft, who is to be the top law enforcement officer in the United
   States, hardly understands this when he proclaims that.Jesus is king of
   America. In the meantime, in his celebrated interview with the Southern
   Partisan Quarterly Review, a well-known racist journal (a "sick magazine",
   according to Bob Herbert of the New York Times), he proclaimed the fight
   against slavery as "the perverted agenda" of those who fought to end that
   horrid practice.33 He wants Americans to pray - privately and in all
   public institutions, including schools and other government buildings -
   but when he announces that the attempt to end slavery was "perverted," how
   can we possibly believe that he is a man of any faith at all? His attempts
   to convince us that he didn't know what Bob Jones University or the
   Southern Partisan were all about are pretty disingenuous. He is a man
   without credibility - how could he possibly be otherwise? If he were a man
   of principle, true principle, he would never have claimed that he would
   enforce laws that deny those principles. Like his president, he is an
   opportunist, one of those denatured creatures Paine attacked in Common
   Sense.

        In the meantime, maybe we could say that Paine would favor President
   Bush's intentions to cut taxes, even if the vast majority of taxes go to
   the wealthiest eight percent. As a man of the eighteenth-century as we've
   indicated, he believed that the best government is that government which
   governs the least, it is but "a necessary evil." On the other hand, when
   he outlined in the Rights of Man a full-scale welfare program, including
   one of the first social security proposals ever set forth, it is clear
   that he thought there are lots of things a "good" government could do to
   help its people.34 He also must have known that government had to have the
   financial wherewithal to handle such major programs and that taxes would
   have to be levied on Americans. In fact, even those Americans who fought
   the imperial Britain for independence were not opposed to paying taxes in
   general - they thought that everyone should pay them, including the
   aristocracy (and certainly the Penns on their estates in America).
   Americans regarded taxes as voluntary gifts to the crown - they were not
   to be imposed by a distant Parliament, but levied on themselves to be sent
   to London because they, the Americans, wanted to pay them. So when taxes
   are cut, and they may well be soon, we can be certain that if the Bush
   administration has anything to do with it, the agencies that will be most
   hurt will not be defense, but the social programs that cannot stand up to
   the perils of "compassionate conservatism."

        But should we be doing something about the surplus in terms of paying
   down the national debt, as the Clinton administration and Gore campaign
   had proposed? I should think that Paine would have thought that a debt the
   size of ours (nearing $5 trillion) would easily bankrupt the nation. It
   has always been a curiosity to many Paine observers that in Common Sense
   he actually advocated a debt. "Debts we have none," he wrote, "and
   whatever we may contract on this account will serve as a glorious memento
   of our virtue. . . . No nation ought to be without a debt. A national debt
   is a national bond."35  But Paine was talking about a new nation - one
   that needed the massive expenditures to insure that tyranny was not only
   to die, but would not revive. Thus it was that the debt was to stimulate,
   as he put it, a national bond: a unity of the people as they paid for
   their defense, especially, in his view, a navy. America in 2001 is not
   America in 1776. I suspect he would be horrified to see how the debt has
   gone way beyond creating national unity and leading to bankruptcy for any
   other country.

        Finally, what would Paine have said about the fact that the United
   States has become one of the most regulated, if not over regulated,
   societies in the world? Again, we refer to his observation that government
   is a necessary evil. When power is concentrated in the hands of the few
   that, by very definition, is an example of tyranny. To allow, for example,
   oil companies, the trucking industry, or whatever to do whatever they want
   because we naively believe that they will always do the right thing is to
   fall into the trap of denying the reality of human nature. Already the
   trucking and oil industry has demanded the Bush administration relax, if
   not terminate, the strict clean air regulations the Clinton administration
   put in effect last year.36 And who has the president nominated to become
   the new Secretary of the Interiror, but none other than the chief 
   non-regulator of the environment, Gail Norton, whose years as Attorney 
   General of Colorado saw industry get away with just about anything and 
   everything it desired. There is probably no law enforcement in America, 
   past or present, who sought to undo the Endangered Species Act  as much 
   as she did while in Colorado. She would be expected to do as much  as a
   protege of James Watt, who had been her boss at the Mountain States
   Legal Foundation, which sought to give industry a larger, if not complete,
   say over the disposition of public lands. Like John Ashcroft, however, she
   promised to enforce the very laws she opposed for so many years. Again, so
   much for principle.
   
        I could go on and on, but I won't bore you with what I think you
   already know, even if you disagree with some of my observations. I will
   conclude by saying why I think Philadelphia should honor Thomas Paine.
   Just last October, a new biography of Benjamin Franklin appeared with the
   title "The First American."37 I don't wish to draw anything from Franklin,
   even if I possibly could, or to insult those among you who [are], as I am,
   a lover of Ben Franklin. But I have to say that I originally was going to
   title my Paine biography "the first American." I decided not to because I
   thought it had a bit of a racist ring to it in that the native Americans
   were really the first Americans, although someone argued that they were
   not Americans since that concept did not exist until the English first
   arrived on these shores. But just as Philadelphia and Franklin are so
   uniquely united in the imagination of most people so are Philadelphia and
   Paine. (And don't forget that Franklin was born in Boston and went to
   Philadelphia when he was seventeen.) Philadelphia without Paine is, to me, 
   a hand without fingers: useless and ugly. I hope that the city
   honors him, and soon. Thanks for having me here tonight, and thanks so
   much for listening. I'll be happy to take questions.

   sometimes have good sense, and I always love the truth. . . - Reason is
   common to us, and we have the same interest in listening to it. If I think
   well, why would you not think as do I?" "Bon sens" is indeed, for Rousseau

   13. Ibid., 68. When Fliegelman speaks of Paine's idea of sensibility, he
   relates it to nature by saying, "it is nature, not reason, that cannot
   forgive England." He thus makes clear the conjunction between nature and
   affection (in common sense), but he does not cite Paine's last quoted
   statement in full when Paine himself conjoined nature with both moral
   affection and reason. See Fliegelman, Prodigals and Pilgrims,103.

   as that "French bastard landing with an armed banditti . . . is in plain
   terms a very paltry rascally original." Paine, Common Sense, 78.

   Respited?" (19 January 1793), in The Complete Writings, II, 556-58 (the
   latter includes Marat's interruptions of Paine's speech). Paine's
   impassioned plea for the life of Louis XVI may be attributable to a number
   of things: Paine's maturity by 1793, his realization that the French under
   Louis were quite helpful during the American war against Britain, or
   perhaps his awareness that the revolution itself was potentially heading
   toward a negative end.
