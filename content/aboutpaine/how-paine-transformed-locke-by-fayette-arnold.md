   CHANGING THE 18TH CENTURIES VIEW OF LIFE

   "In My Judgment, Thomas Paine Was the Best Political Writer That Ever
   Lived. What He Wrote Was Pure Nature, And His Soul And His Pen Went
   Together. Ceremony, Pageantry, And All the Paraphernalia Of Power Had No
   Effect Upon Him. He Examined Into The Why And Wherefore Of Things. He Was
   Perfectly Radical In His Mode of Thought. Nothing Short Of Bedrock
   Satisfied Him"1. Robert G. Ingersoll

   Introduction

   Despite Thomas Paine's numerous contributions to America and the world,
   his most significant accomplishment has escaped the attention of scholars
   as well as students of history. There is an important and vital area of
   his thought and creativity, completely neglected, which illuminates
   Paine's unique role in American and World History. One of many factors
   that make Thomas Paine a great historical figure and force is his
   transformation of Lockean Philosophy. In fact, he significantly changed
   the structure and meaning of Locke's thought system. In modifying the
   public's understanding of Locke, Paine altered the character and destiny
   of American and World History. This may be Paine's greatest contribution
   to mankind as well as the seminal aspect of his intellectual activities
   that makes him one of the world's most prominent and original thinkers.

   Thomas Paine's ideas and efforts inspired and consolidated the American
   Revolution. He provided the colonists with the fuel to fire their
   rebellion. His majestic phrases rang through the colonies and united
   Americans in a common cause. Paine's eloquence in speech and the power of
   his pen imparted the ideals and courage needed for the founding of a new
   nation. In his efforts to unite and direct the colonists, Paine created
   what may have been one of his greatest phrases - The United State of
   America.

   The American concepts of freedom, equality, and human rights, which came
   from the mind and pen of Thomas Paine, set the 18th century world ablaze.
   He gave Americans and Europeans the rational, inspiration, and confidence
   to reject outmoded social and political structures of the past and the
   courage to create new ones that would provide a better future for mankind.
   Men and women were longing for a social order where there was justice as
   well as the ability to achieve their human potential.

   Democracy would provide the new vehicle for reaching age old aspirations.
   A modification of the philosophy of John Locke would be a stepping stone
   to that brighter future. Thomas Paine went far beyond Locke's thinking and
   created a new intellectual architecture and world view. Paine broke the
   bonds of the 18th centuries' intellectual framework, philosophical, social
   and political. He shattered the structure that John Locke's thinking was
   contained within and which his ideas supported. America is not founded on
   the ideas of John Locke per se, but upon the transformation of his
   concepts by Thomas Paine. In altering Locke, Paine gave his ideas meanings
   that John Locke would not have recognized or accepted.

   Paine's ideas and concepts about freedom, equality and independence were
   new and unique. They went well beyond the opinions embraced by Europeans
   and colonial Americans. For example, according to John Locke man was free,
   equal an independent in the state of nature, but gave up that status when
   he accepted the "Social Compact" and joined society. In Locke's own words,
   "But though men when they enter society give up the equality, liberty and
   executive power they had in the state of nature into the hands of
   society... yet it being only with the intention in everyone to preserve
   himself, his liberty and property".2  Locke apparently sees no conflict
   between individuals giving up equality, liberty, and executive power over
   self and their likely status and treatment within an autocratic society.
   His "Social Compact" takes away from the individual the very ideals Locke
   appears to be espousing. In the mind of Thomas Paine, men were free, equal
   and independent within society. This was a radical notion and a threat to
   the political and social structure of the 18th century world. The
   consequences of this shift in thinking were enormous as it fundamentally
   changed a world view and value system that Europeans had revered for
   centuries.

   According to Locke's conception of man and society, human beings are not
   free, equal or independent because they have accepted a "Social Compact".
   Locke finds a variety of reasons for condoning inequality and injustice as
   well as a lack of freedom and independence within the social and political
   orders. He claims that the invention of money created conditions whereby
   men give their "consent" and "agree" that the earth's possessions should
   be "disproportionate" and "unequal". Further, Locke proclaims that the
   unequal conditions of wealth created by money operate outside the "bounds
   of society" as well as the "Compact". Although he gives many reasons for
   human inequality, Locke still states that, "All men by nature are equal. I
   cannot propose to understand all sorts of equality. Age or virtue may give
   men a just precedence. Excellency of parts and merit may place others
   above the common level. Birth may subject some, and alliance or benefits
   others..."3 It is obvious, except to Locke, that the ideals he professes
   do not apply in the social and political atmosphere existing in England.
   Locke is consistently inconsistent in his thinking and cannot logically
   reconcile his philosophy with the world of reality.

   Locke fails to perceive the conflict between his abstract ideals and the
   reasons he give for their circumvention in the concrete world. In
   addition, he does not understand that most of the inequality and injustice
   existing in his day was due to the structure of society and government
   which favored the few and handicapped the many. His explanation of the
   reasons for differences in status and wealth within society ignores the
   impact of social and political arrangements that create inequity and
   limited opportunity for the majority of the population. Locke's writings
   also lack political and social insights that could be utilized to create
   programs to alleviate injustice and inequity resulting from England's
   feudal and autocratic traditions. Of course, his aims were not egalitarian
   but elitist.

   John Locke does not utilize the term republic or republican in his
   writings, but frequently employs the word commonwealth which he defines as
   a civilized community. In fact, Locke in his "Essay Concerning Civil
   Government" uses the word commonwealth over 75 times. Further, the term
   democracy is only mentioned once and that is for the purpose of defining
   commonwealth as not meaning democracy. Locke's philosophy is clearly
   concerned with the formation of a commonwealth rather than the creation of
   a republic. Locke affirms this by saying, "By commonwealth, I must be
   understood all along to mean, not a democracy, or form of government, but
   an independent community which the Latins signify by the word civitas, to
   which the word which best answers in our language is commonwealth, and
   most properly expresses such a society of men"4. Locke's philosophy is
   focused on building a civilized society that would avoid the political and
   social strife that existed in his era. His goal was not to create a
   government based upon democratic values, but to establish a refined,
   rational, well mannered, and harmonious social order founded upon a
   traditional belief in limited monarchy.  

   Interpreters of Locke's philosophy have extracted his belief in republican
   principles from his use of certain words, especially terms like "freedom",
   "equality", and "executive power over self", and his emphasis on laws
   being created, not by the king but by the legislature. Locke indicates
   that the legislature in making laws not only checks the power of the
   sovereign, it also "puts men out of the state of nature into that of
   commonwealth". He believes that the legislature is the means by which men
   achieve the purpose or end results of their entering into society. The
   reason human beings accept social institutions are the "enjoyment of their
   properties in peace and safety". Further, the "instrument" and "means" of
   fulfilling this aim are the "laws established in society (by the
   legislature)".5

   Traditional expositions of John Locke's philosophy credit him with
   creating democratic ideas that were responsible for inspiring the American
   and French Revolutions. In fact, customary explanations of his ideology
   express the belief that the structure of the American state is predicated
   upon Locke's political and social ideals. Conventional proponents of
   Lockean thought also indicate he embraced the opinion that society and the
   state are independent of each other. This interpretation of Locke is
   founded on the conviction that the social order is based upon natural law
   and commonly shared moral rights. From his notion of natural law,
   exponents of Locke deduce that he supported the precept that the state and
   society are separate entities. To Lockes' interpreters, this implies the
   formation of a social order that is democratic in nature and which
   requires very little in the way of government.

   However, a close inspection of John Locke's philosophy reveals that the
   above points of view are invalid.  It is impossible to associate Locke's
   beliefs concerning the reasons for as well as the role of government with
   the theory of natural law. The political and social functions of
   government devised and implemented by the English Aristocracy and Monarchy
   are in conflict with the doctrine of natural and moral law. In fact,
   Locke's "Democratic Ideals" are abrogated by his "Social Compact" and his
   belief in Autocratic government. Again, according to Locke, it is
   government (Laws enacted by the legislature) that takes man out of the
   state of nature. Only by abandoning the freedom, equality and independence
   men possessed in the state of nature can mankind live in harmony within
   society. Locke's fundamental precepts and the society he is attempting to
   create are diametrically opposed. It is quite apparent that his social and
   political orders are not separate entities. In fact, they are one and the
   same due to his replacing natural law with political laws that are derived
   from a government ruled by the Nobility and Sovereign. In John Locke's
   thought system, God's law has been replaced by man's law. This results in
   the creation of a state and society that are neither separate from one
   another or republican in nature.

   Thomas Paine offered mankind an alternative to John Locke's conflicting
   and illogical thought system. Paine rejected any philosophy advancing the
   idea that social and political equality is best achieved in a society
   ruled by Patricians and Monarchs. In contrast to Locke, Paine created a
   democratic belief system based upon popular sovereignty. He replaced a
   medieval view of the social and political orders with an outlook that was
   both Modern and Egalitarian. By presenting an approach to society and
   government that was based upon an acceptance of natural law as well as
   upon his understanding of God's will for mankind, Paine handed the world a
   new and different philosophy as well as an expanded world view in which
   men would be equal, free and independent within the social and political
   orders. He not only gave old words and ideas new meanings but also greater
   dimensions and depth. Thomas Paine's beliefs and not John Locke's "Social
   Compact" became the legal and social foundation of American society. Our
   nation's intellectual and spiritual character came directly from the mind
   of Thomas Paine.

    

   THOMAS PAINE AND JOHN LOCKE RE-EXAMINED

   Thomas Paine's fundamental belief system as well as his views on the
   origin and purpose of government are strikingly different than John
   Locke's. His intrinsic principles were based upon a belief in freedom,
   equality, human rights and security for all of mankind. Paine's opinions
   with respect to the reasons for and the objectives of government were, in
   fact, contrary to those of John Locke. To quote Thomas Paine, "Here then
   is the origin and rise of government; namely, a mode rendered necessary by
   the inability of moral virtue to govern the world; here is the design and
   end of government, viz. "freedom and security".6 His belief in human
   freedom rested upon the foundation of equal rights. In his own words, "Why
   then not trace the rights of man, to the creation of man. The illuminating
   and divine principle of equal rights of man (for it had its origin from
   the maker of man), relates not only to the living individuals; but to
   generations of men succeeding each other. Every history of creation...
   agree in establishing one point, the unity of man; by which I mean that
   men are all of one degree and consequently that all men are born equal and
   with equal rights'.7 "His natural rights are the foundation of all his
   civil rights".8

   Thomas Paine summed up his political and social viewpoint by saying, "Men
   are born; an always continue, free and equal in respect to their rights.
   The end of all political association, is, the preservation of the natural
   an imprescriptible rights of man... political liberty consists in the
   power of doing whatever does not injure another. The exercise of the
   natural rights of every man has no other limit than those that are
   necessary to secure to every other man the free exercise of the same
   rights and these limits are determined by law".9

   Because men are born having equal rights and retain these rights within
   the social and political order, government according to Paine must be
   based upon the will of the people. To ensure their rights, citizens must
   be allowed to direct their own affairs. This belief in the consent of the
   governed presents a sharp contrast to John Locke's philosophy in which
   government and society are based upon rule by monarchs and patricians. The
   objective of Locke's social and political thinking is to protect those who
   have property and social status. Locke's thought system certainly was not
   predicated on power to the people. His was an elitist conception of
   society. Dominate power in the social and political orders was shared by
   the king and aristocracy. In fact, the purpose of Locke's writings were to
   confirm and justify existing conditions in English society and government,
   conditions that were inherited from a medieval world order and world view.

   John Locke's philosophy was founded upon exclusivity, selectivity as well
   as patrimony and not upon the universality and equality of mankind. Locke
   conceives of government as an institution that primarily serves and
   protects the noble and the few. Thus, government and the power structure
   that controls it are purposely designed to be undemocratic in nature.
   Paine believed that government should be constructed and operated so that
   it directed its efforts to serve the greater good of all citizens. Unlike
   John Locke, he did not feel that bloodline and property should determine
   one's station and opportunities in life. Republican government is not
   based upon property and pedigree but on majority rule.

   According to the philosopher Bertrand Russell, John Locke is "the most
   influential though by no means the most profound of philosophers".10
   Locke's philosophy was "little more than a clarification and
   systematization of prevalent opinion in England".11 "Even before the
   reformation theologians tended to believe in setting limits to kingly
   power".12 "What Locke has to say about the state of nature and the law of
   nature, in the main, is not original, but a repetition of medieval
   scholastic doctrine".13 Bertrand Russell states that his ideas can be
   traced back to the writings of "Saint Thomas Aquinas and Hugo Grotius".14
   John Locke in dealing with the concepts of liberty, human rights, and
   equality was looking to the past at ideals that he felt were already
   established. Thomas Paine by contrast was looking to the future at ideals
   that needed to be actualized.

   Although John Locke's thinking was affected by the Renaissance and
   Reformation, his ideas on government and society find their roots in
   Medieval Europe. To be more specific, Locke's philosophy is derived from
   the thought structure of the medieval Catholic Church which was based upon
   a combination of Aristotelian philosophy and Christian revelation. The
   Schoolmen of the middle ages, who were exponents of Scholasticism,
   propounded arguments to challenge the theory of the divine right of kings
   in order to justify the Popes position as being superior to that of
   monarchs. Despite the fact that Locke rejected Scholasticism, his
   political and social outlook was rooted in this system of thought. The
   Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Reformation as well as the Enlightenment
   should not be viewed as sharply divided eras, but as a gradual transition
   occurring during a period of over 1300 years. The various ages did react
   against one another, sometimes with great passion. However, even with
   their predilection for zealotry, like children rebelling against their
   parents, much of the parent remained in the child.

   Notwithstanding the impact of the past upon Thomas Paine, his philosophy
   and belief system was not acquired from Scholasticism. Paine's ideas and
   ideals were inspired by the Enlightenment and his Deist theological
   beliefs. He felt that God revealed himself to man through nature. Thus,
   reason and science were the means of approaching both truth and one's
   creator. In brief, Thomas Paine's philosophy came from the Modern world
   and not the Middle Ages. America's world view and value system is derived
   from Rationalism rather than Scholasticism.

   There are additional reasons for concluding that Thomas Paine's philosophy
   was not acquired from John Locke. Professor Jack Fruchtman, Jr. in the
   introduction to his book, Thomas Paine Apostle of Freedom, quotes Paine as
   saying, "I never read John Locke, nor ever had the work in my hand".15
   Thomas Paine's philosophy was created from his belief in human reason and
   his vision of God's ongoing plan for humanity. It was not acquired from
   reading John Locke or being influenced by the medieval power struggles of
   the Christian Church. Paine is clearly a product of the Enlightenment;
   Locke a reflection of the Reformation, Renaissance and Middle Ages.
   Unfortunately, we have attributed our modern view of freedom, equality and
   democracy to John Locke's philosophical beliefs and have failed to
   perceive that our American thought and value system is unique and thus
   quite different than his.

   Bertrand Russell also states that John Locke's concepts with respect to
   the law of nature and the state of nature are not only unoriginal; they
   are in addition quite vague. Per Russell, "The nearest thing to a
   definition of the state of nature to be found in Locke is the following:
   Men living together according to reason, without a common superior on
   earth: with authority to judge between them; is properly called the state
   of nature".16 Russell comments, "This is not a description of the life of
   savages, but of an imagined community of virtuous anarchists, who need no
   police or law courts because they always obey "Reason", which is the same
   as "Natural Law", which in turn, consists of those laws of conduct that
   are held to have divine origin".17 Locke's beliefs that human beings are
   equal, independent, and rational are naive and contradictory as well as
   disingenuous. The vague and contrary nature of Locke's thinking has
   allowed us to read into his writings ideas and beliefs that he did not
   embrace. In fact, modern interpretations of his philosophy would have
   surprised him.

   In Locke's opinion the "State of Nature" was abrogated by a "Social
   Compact" which created government. The "State of Nature" is not dissolved
   by just any compact, but only one that can make a single body politic. In
   brief, Locke begins his thinking with a supposition that he refers to as a
   "State of Nature". This state is antecedent to any and all human
   government. It is ruled by a "Law of Nature" which is based upon divine
   commands rather than being imposed by human legislation. Men finally
   emerged from this "State of Nature" by creating a "Social Compact" which
   became the means for inaugurating civil government. Of course in light of
   logic and man's historical experience, the concept of the "Social Compact"
   seems absurd. However, it may have been the best and most practical
   explanation people could envisage to account for the creation of
   government and society.

   According to John Locke, "The great and chief end of men uniting into
   commonwealths, and putting  themselves under government is to protect
   their property, to which in the state of nature there are many things
   wanting".18 Property plays a prominent and in fact dominant role in his
   political and social  philosophy. It is obvious from his writings that
   property is the main reason for creating the institution known as
   government. In fact, Bertrand Russell proclaims that "Locke is driven by
   his worship of property."19 Again, it should be noted that the purpose of
   government for Paine is to ensure freedom, equality, human rights, and
   security for all human beings.

   Locke's obsession with property must be emphasized as it reflects a belief
   system as well as a social and political outlook that is fundamentally at
   odds with Thomas Paine's thinking and the American conception of
   democracy. John Locke's thought system reserved political influence for
   those who were eminent both socially and economically. John Locke believed
   that economic power in the form of money was the real derivation of
   political power. He felt that predominate political control should be
   vested within the aristocracy. Those individuals in society who have
   conspicuous monetary interests should manage government. Citizens lacking
   pronounced wealth in either property or money did not deserve a voice in
   the affairs of state. In fact, the aristocracy feared the lower classes
   because they were the majority within society. A government and society
   based upon majority rule would not bode well for the nobility. In contrast
   to Locke, Paine believed in rule by the majority as well as universal
   suffrage so that all citizens could have a voice in government. Locke's
   philosophy was not designed to support democracy or the welfare of the
   common man. His social, political and economic beliefs were the antithesis
   of Thomas Paine's egalitarian views regarding humanity, government and
   society.

   John Locke actually believed that English society and government
   correspond to his expressed ideals. Thomas Paine rejected the assumption
   that the English people were free, independent and lived within an
   egalitarian society. He bluntly stated that their government was not
   republican in nature. In his words, "If we will suffer ourselves to
   examine the component parts of the English Constitution, we shall find
   them to be base remains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with some new
   republican materials.

    First: The remains of monarchial tyranny in the person of the King.

    Second: The remains of aristocratical tyranny in the persons of the
   Peers.

   Thirdly: The new republican materials, in the persons of the Commons, on
   whose virtue depends the freedom of England.  

   The first two being hereditary, are independent of the people; wherefore
   in a constitutional sense they contribute nothing towards the freedom of
   the state. To say, "that the constitution of England is a union of three
   powers, reciprocally checking each other, is farcical, either the words
   have no meaning, or they are flat contradictions."20 Paine avows that the
   British government is based upon the principles of despotism. In fact, he
   feels that in England there are despotic rivalries between the King,
   Parliament and the Church. The conflicts amongst these three entities were
   exacerbated because they functioned within a society which evolved out of
   feudalism. According to Paine, the remaining elements of feudalism within
   British society were also a form of tyranny. He believed that the
   fundamental nature of English culture and its government precluded it from
   being a democracy.

   To properly compare the difference between John Locke's and Thomas Paine's
   philosophy, it is necessary to further explore their conflicting
   viewpoints regarding the nature of society and government. First we will
   allow Paine to speak for himself and then compare his thought system to
   John Locke's. Paine indicates that there are "several sources from which
   governments have arisen, and on which they have been founded. First,
   superstition. Secondly, power. Thirdly, the common interests of society
   and the rights of man. The first was government of priest craft, the
   second of conquerors, and the third of reason".21 Paine indicates that
   monarchy and aristocracy emerged from governments that were founded upon
   conquest. He is clearly annoyed with the idea of government and society
   being established on the basis of either superstition or conquest. Paine
   expresses his dissatisfaction withthese two kinds of government by saying,
   "I became irritated at the attempt to govern mankind by forceor fraud".22

   Paine indicates that in his day there were only two types of government.
   He states, "The two modes ofgovernment which prevail in the world are,
   first, government by election and representation: secondly, government by
   hereditary succession. The former is generally known by the name of
   republic; the latter by that of monarchy and aristocracy. These two
   distinct and opposite forms, erect themselves on two distinct and opposite
   bases of reason and ignorance".23 According to Paine, prior to the
   American experiment there were no revolutions worthy of the name. He sees
   the American enterprise as the source of modern democracy. In brief, the
   modern republican form of government began with the American Revolution.
   Thomas Paine asserts, "What were formerly called revolutions, were little
   more than a change of persons, or an alteration of local circumstances".24
   "One of the great advantages of the American Revolution has been, that it
   led to the discovery of the principles, and laid open the impositions, of
   governments. All revolutions till then had worked within the atmosphere of
   a court, and never the great floor of the nation. The parties were always
   of the class of courtiers; and whatever was the rage for reformation, they
   carefully preserved the fraud of the profession. It is impossible that
   such governments that have hither to existed in the world could have
   commenced by any other means than a total violation of every principle,
   sacred and moral".25

   Paine in his analysis of the inadequacies of British government and
   society criticizes hereditary rule as irrational and in fact ludicrous. He
   points out that virtue, wisdom, intelligence and moral character are not
   evenly passed on from generation to generation. Their quality and variety
   vary through time to an extent that government is subject to being run by
   human passions and driven by accidents. Objections to hereditary rule
   could only be removed if virtue and wisdom as well as other attributes
   required by an overlord were, in fact, inherited. Paine declares that,
   "The representative system of government takes society and civilization
   for its basis; nature, reason, and experience for its guide. The
   hereditary system, therefore, is as repugnant to human wisdom, as to human
   rights, and is absurd, as it is unjust. A hereditary governor is an
   inconsistent as hereditary author".26

   In his writings Thomas Paine builds a strong case for the superiority of
   republican government due to its rationality and civility. He is also
   convinced that Britain fails to qualify as a republic, not only because of
   its governmental structure, but by reason of its lack of a constitution.
   Paine states that "Government without a constitution is power without a
   right. All delegated power is a trust, and all assumed power is
   usurpation".27 He asserts that a constitution is not created by
   government, but by an act of the people. A constitution belongs to the
   nation and is not the property of those who rule. In fact, it is
   antecedent to and distinct from government. Paine cites America as being
   an example of a nation where constitutions are established by the
   authority of the citizenry. In contrasting England to America he declares
   that, "In the Magna Charta and Bill of Rights...we see nothing of a
   constitution, but only of restrictions on assumed power. From the time of
   William (the Conqueror) a species of government arose, issuing out of this
   coalition or rights...that can be described by no other name than despotic
   legislation...the only right it acknowledges out of itself, is the right
   of petitioning. Where is the constitution that either gives or restrains
   power"?28

   Paine concludes his arguments against the British form of government by
   stating that it is a species of slavery, whereas representative rule
   establishes and secures freedom. He feels that because England lacks a
   true constitution there is nothing to regulate or restrain the abuse of
   power. As a result of the absence of a constitution, government is both
   irrational and tyrannical. Paine declares, "Government is but now
   beginning to be known. Hither to it has been the mere exercise of power,
   which forbade all effectual inquiry into rights, and grounded itself
   wholly on possessions. The rights of man are the rights of all generations
   of men, and cannot be monopolized by any".29

   According to modern interpretations of Lock's philosophy, he believed that
   Britain was a "republic" because Parliament had the authority to make laws
   and check as well as control the executive branch of government (the
   King). Locke felt that power resided in the people or to be more precise
   in their chosen representatives. However, when referring to political
   power, the term people to Locke means men of property. In his political
   and social system, power is in the hands of the Aristocracy and Sovereign.
   Paine attacked the English government as it represented a combination of
   tyrannical Royalty and decadent Aristocracy. Because of its power
   structure and lack of a constitution, British style government placed
   severe limitations on the concept of democracy. There is a republican
   element in this system due to the fact that Parliament consisted of a
   House of Commons as well as a House of Lords. However, the House of Lords
   was the dominate power and the system of electing people to the House of
   Commons was far from democratic. The few rather than the many chose the
   nations representatives. It was not until the 20th century (Parliament Act
   of 1911) that legislative supremacy shifted to the House of Commons.

   It is interesting that Locke in his discourses relating to the structure
   and functions of government has absolutely nothing to say about the
   judiciary. This is astonishing as debates regarding the judiciaries role
   within the framework of government were common. In fact, the subject was a
   heated topic of  discussion in Locke's day. A strong judiciary would have
   the potential to alleviate the imbalances of power within the British
   system of government and cause it to evolve along a more democratic path.
   Locke overlooked the importance, in fact the necessity, of an independent
   judiciary as a prerequisite for ensuring that government would be just,
   impartial as well as truly republican in nature. Not only was Locke's view
   of government lacking in balance and substance, he failed to perceive that
   the government and social system that he was advocating was actually
   non-existent. To quote Bertrand Russell, "Locke seemed blandly unaware
   that, in all the countries of Europe, the realization of his programs
   (philosophy) would hardly be possible without a bloody revolution. The odd
   thing is that he could announce doctrines requiring so much revolution
   before they could be put into effect, and yet show no sign that he thought
   the system existing in his day unjust, or that he was aware of it being
   different from the system he advocated".30

   Locke's attitude isn't surprising if one realizes that he wasn't
   advocating modern democracy, but the status quo of British society and
   government. The purpose of his writings were to provide a Justification
   for the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688 and 1689. John Locke was attempting
   to defend the past and to do so within the framework of traditional
   British society. Unlike Thomas Paine, he was not acting to create the
   future order of mankind. Locke did not envisage our modern American
   concept of republican government. He had no clue with respect to the
   nature of our egalitarian world view and value system. In essence, Locke's
   philosophy reflected convictions that were popular in his day. Thus,
   Paine's and Locke's thought systems are dissimilar in origin and content.
   Because they often used similar terminology does not mean their words are
   synonymous.

   According to Bertrand Russell, "Locke is the most fortunate of all
   philosophers. He completed his work in theoretical philosophy just at the
   moment when the government of his country fell into the hands of men who
   shared his political opinions. Both in practice and in theory, the views
   which he advocated were held, for many years to come, by the most vigorous
   and influential politicians and philosophers".31 This statement is true
   until Paine's entry upon the world stage in the latter half of the 18th
   century. Then John Locke would be forever transformed.

   The increase in democratization within Britain in the 19th and 20th
   centuries was due to a delayed and reluctant response to revolutions in
   American and France. The English government did not just wake up in the
   20th century and shift controlling power to the House of Commons because
   it finally understood John Locke. What impacted and moved the people of
   England to accept democratic reforms were the ideas and ideals born out of
   the American Revolution. An extreme slowness to embrace change and a
   hidebound worship of tradition lies at the heart of British character. To
   this day, modern English Democracy is combined with an archaic and
   debilitated monarchy. Bertrand Russell in trying to explain the English
   temperament, as well as to account for John Locke's paradoxical thinking
   states, "A conflict between King and Parliament in the civil war gave
   Englishmen, once for all, a love of compromise and moderation, and a fear
   of pushing any theory to its logical conclusion, which has dominated them
   down to the present time".32 When dealing with Locke there is an obvious
   difference between appearance and reality. The simplest way of resolving
   the evident paradox that exists in Locke's political and social ideas that
   sharply conflict with his actual beliefs and life style, is to realize
   that Locke's world view and value system are a mirror image of his
   understanding of past and current British culture. In brief, his value
   system and world view were not contrary to, but embraced traditional
   British institutions and their underlying precepts. Again, Locke was
   attempting to conserve and modify rather than dismantle the structure of
   the old world order. In brief, he was not trying to create new political
   and social formations.

   In order to more fully comprehend the dissimilarity between the political
   and social outlook of John Locke and Thomas Paine, it is necessary to
   understand that they were born over 100 years apart (1632-1704 versus
   1737-1809). Both were affected by unique social, political and religious
   forces and as a result had distinctive concerns and goals. Not only did
   Locke and Paine live in separate eras, they were from different social
   classes and did not share the same cultural views. The era in which they
   lived and their social class status resulted in divergent and conflicting
   philosophies. Paine's goal was to usher in a new world order based upon
   fresh and untried social and political ideals and structures. Locke's aim
   was to justify the political and social arrangements already in existence.
   Locke grew up during a time of civil war and social disorder. He believed
   that the only foundation for eliminating violence and securing peace
   within society was through government by a protestant monarchy that was
   checked as well as controlled by Parliament. In addition to limited
   monarchy and rule by the aristocracy, he visualized a comprehensive and
   tolerant church establishment that would embrace the majority of
   discordant religious sects within society. Locke felt that the appropriate
   balances between the branches of government, as well as between government
   and church, would result in civility and harmony within the social order.
   He was convinced that the current structure of British government and
   society provided for a peaceful and civilized culture. In contrast, it was
   Paine's opinion that "All European governments (France now excepted) are
   constructed not on the principles of universal civilization, but on the
   reverse of  it..."33 Paine felt that European governments (excluding
   France)actually placed themselves above the law and ignored both the will
   of the people and the will of God.

   Paine like Locke grew up in a time of social unrest. However, instead of
   attempting to justify the social and political world about him, he
   rebelled against its restrictive and oppressive nature. In contrast to
   Locke, Paine who was born into a lower social class was repulsed by the
   injustice and adverse social conditions that flourished around him in
   English society. He said, "When...we see age going to the workhouse and
   youth to the gallows in a civilized country, something must be wrong in
   the system of government. Why is it that scarcely any are executed but the
   poor? Young people should be educated and older people supported...The
   resources of a country are lavished upon kings, upon courts, upon
   hirelings. The poor are compelled to support the fraud that oppresses
   them"...34 Paine displays his anger towards inequitable social conditions
   by saying, "When it shall be said in any country in the world, my poor are
   happy, neither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them, my jails
   are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want,
   the taxes are not oppressive...When these things can be said, then may
   that country boast about its constitution and government".35

   Thomas Paine believed that poverty, ignorance and injustice were a
   national disgrace. In order to eliminate injustice and resolve social
   problems, he advocated social and political reforms on a grand scale and
   in a manner that is original and modern. Not only did Paine extol modern
   republican government and the universal franchises, he recommended and
   pleaded for state sponsored programs such as medical care, guaranteed
   employment and compensation, maintenance and security for the elderly and
   indigent, as well as free universal education. No other person in the
   revolutionary period was pleading for social security, socialized
   medicine, free universal education and other forms of state welfare.
   Thomas Jefferson did suggest a state funded educational program. His plan
   was created years earlier by a curriculum committee [Jefferson's
   educational program was devised by a committee of revisors at the College
   of William and Mary in 1779. It was presented by Jefferson to the Virginia
   legislature in 1817. 12.] Paine made it clear that his ideas and proposals
   were neither paternalistic or Christian philanthropy. According to Paine,
   these state supported social programs were not charity but a right.

   In both social thought and humane policies, Paine stood alone and was
   ahead of his times. He advanced these and other ideas on government's
   civic responsibilities almost 150 years before the rise of social
   democracy. No similar sweeping social reforms can be found in John Locke's
   writings. In fact, they are conspicuous by their absence. Locke has been
   cited for representing liberal thought that grew out of the Renaissance
   and Reformation. It should be noted, his thinking is only liberal compared
   to that of the Middle Ages. It does not reflect modern liberalism which
   grew out of the Enlightenment. Thomas Paine is the father of modern
   liberalism. Our American view of the nature of government and society can
   be traced to his writings and not those of John Locke. The inspiration for
   radical change, within mankind's social and political orders, came from
   the new and not the old world.

   Another critical area of thought that distinguishes Thomas Paine's
   Philosophy from John Locke's relates to Paine's seminal thinking regarding
   the nature of the relationship between society and government. One of the
   most original and creative aspects of Paine's thought system, that made
   the modern world possible, is the discrimination he made between civil
   society and government. In brief, he changed mankind's view concerning the
   relationship of society and government. "Common Sense" is the first modern
   political essay to make and defend a distinction (separation) between the
   concepts of state and civil society. Previous to the printing of this
   political tract the terms state and civil society were looked at as being
   the same. All American and European writers, including Locke, utilized the
   concept of civil society to portray political associations that bound
   people together. In European tradition the state and civil society are
   interchangeable terms. Elemental or conclusive power was originally vested
   in the king and over time increasingly shared with members of the
   aristocracy. Louis XIV summed up the old worlds political and social point
   of view (philosophy) when he said, "I am the state". According to Thomas
   Paine the people are the state.

   Paine turned the 18th century's concept of government and society on its
   head. After and because of "Common Sense" people felt that they, rather
   than rulers and aristocrats, exercised ultimate control over both
   government and society. Past ways of looking at political and social
   relationships were inverted. Overlords would be viewed as subject of the
   citizenry. The divine right of king's philosophy was challenged by a
   thought system that placed decisive authority and power in the hands of
   the populace. A shift in thinking took place in which government of, by
   and for the people became the new reality. The raison d'etre for
   government would be the rights and welfare of the people. America's
   revolution was a struggle between two diametrically positioned
   philosophies, rule from the top or rule by the populace.

   "Common Sense" treated previous political and social concepts and
   principles as obsolete and in fact irrelevant. In order to support a
   republican point of view, Paine had to disconnect the state/civil society
   couplet. He preferred to use the terms society and government. These words
   though related were conceived of as being separate entities. Paine
   believed that government is simply a delegation of power by the public to
   representatives who are to exercise its use for the common good. Power was
   to be utilized to provide universal benefits for the citizenry. Government
   exists to secure individual liberties and to protect the populace from
   harm whether caused by internal or external sources. In short, the role of
   government is to ensure the rights, well-being and advancement of its
   people.

   "Common Sense" was brilliantly written and in fact a revolution in the use
   of language. It mesmerized the American public. Paine's treatise boldly
   argued several critical social ideas from an American point of view. His
   essay did so with great power and enormous consequence. Its originality,
   creativity and uniqueness stimulated public discussions that forever
   changed America. After "Common Sense" American and World History would be
   profoundly altered and find new directions.

   There are other factors in addition to those already presented that reveal
   a difference in the character of these two men. For example, Locke has
   stated, "Lastly those are not all to be tolerated who deny the being of
   God".36 This statement displays a narrow minded and intolerant attitude
   that can be traced to his medieval world view and value system. Locke's
   religious convictions certainly would not support republican government or
   a secular society. To further complicate the matter of understanding the
   disparity between Locke's and Paine's philosophies, history and reference
   books state that the enlightenment was an 18th century intellectual
   movement and John Locke was an exponent of its philosophy. However, Locke
   was born in 1632 and spent all but the last four years of his life in the
   17thcentury. To designate a 17th century man as being the creation of the
   18th century is, to say the least, a solecism. Either our dating schemes
   do not make sense or interpretations of Lockean thought are in error.

   It is apparent that mankind's intellectual activities cannot be neatly
   classified or demarcated by century boundary posts. Dating is a man made
   artificial construct. The fabric of history is a single piece. Change
   occurs continuously over long periods of time and at an accelerating pace
   as new ideas and inventions make further progress possible. In particular,
   the struggle between faith and reason has gone on for thousands of years
   and still persists in the 21st century. A shift in the balance with
   respect to these two entities has occurred since the Middle Ages. However,
   faith and reason are strong components of every period in history. It
   should be observed that no era has been noted for cornering the market on
   rationality. Thomas Paine, even thought he lived during the Enlightenment,
   was severely persecuted by the religious right of his day.

   In spite of the fact that history is a continuum and boundary markers that
   differentiate eras are not easy to establish with great precision, each
   age does have characteristics that make it unique and distinguish it from
   other historical periods. For example, the Renaissance and Reformation
   produced ideas that undermined the Medieval world view. In the words of
   Dr. Crane Brinton, the intelligentsia of these overlapping eras were
   "Agents of Distinction" who set the stage for a new cosmology and
   worldview. Their intellectual achievements were impressive and had great
   impact upon world history by stimulating the development of Protestantism,
   humanism, rationalism and science. Even though the intelligentsia were
   progressive within certain fields of thought, in the social and political
   spheres, they embraced a traditional belief that society is based upon
   rule by Aristrocrats and Monarchs. Thus, they did not adopt a philosophy
   and value system that was democratic in nature.

   It was not until the 18th century that our modern world view was created.
   To quote Professor Crane Brinton, "The democratic world-view was
   formulated in the eighteenth century at the end of three centuries of
   change"...37"Our central theme is how the Medieval view of life was
   altered into the eighteenth century view of life. This eighteenth century
   view of life, though modified in the last two centuries, is still at the
   bottom of our view of life, especially in the United States".38 Thus, the
   Renaissance (14th into the 17th century) and Reformation (16thcentury)
   were a transition period between the Middle Ages (500 to approximately
   1500 AD) and the Enlightenment (18th century) which gave birth to our
   modern democratic outlook on society and government. During the period of
   the Renaissance the forces of Feudalism and Scholasticism, which in the
   past had ordered human life, were visibly shattered. The time period
   between the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment was significant because, it
   provided a view of life that was increasingly rational and scientific
   rather than mystical and theological.

   On the important questions regarding the time span for and the
   interpretation of the Renaissance, the author is accepting Bertrand
   Russell's viewpoint. "The Modern as opposed to the Medieval outlook began
   in Italy (14th century) with a movement called the Renaissance. At first,
   only a few individuals, notable Petrarch had this outlook, but in the 15th
   century it would spread to the great majority of cultivated Italians, both
   lay and clerical".39 "The period of history which is commonly called
   `Modern' has a mental outlook which differs from the Medieval period in
   many ways. Of these, two are most important: the diminishing authority of
   the church, and the increasing authority of science. With these two,
   others are connected. The culture of modern times is more lay than
   clerical. States increasingly replace the church as the governmental
   authority that controls culture".40

   In the world that was emerging, during the modern period of history, human
   reason and science rather than superstition and theology would become the
   major forces shaping our world. From the 14th to the 18th century
   mankind's world was placed on foundations that were more materialistic and
   less theistic. During the 18th century men were willing to let go of the
   past and challenge the concept that people and their political and social
   orders were subservient to Kings, Clerics, and Aristocrats. From this
   point on the theory that power resided in the hands of Monarchs,
   Patricians, and the Church was supplanted by a belief in the rights of the
   common man. In brief, the 18th century contested the idea that the locus
   of power was in the Sovereign, Nobility and Religious Institutions. It was
   decided that the center of political authority was the will of the people.

   The point of view expressed here regarding features of the various
   historical eras is critical not only for understanding the transition from
   the Medieval to the Modern World, it is crucial for comprehending the
   contributions of both Thomas Paine and John Locke to mankind as well as
   ascertaining their proper place in the United States and World History.

    

   SUMMARY

   In comparing and contrasting John Locke's thought system with that of
   Thomas Paine's, my main concerns are that Locke's Philosophy, unlike
   Paine's, is not modern, original, generative, or democratic. By embracing
   past and present social and political conditions in England as reflecting
   an existing egalitarian way of life, John Locke fails to comprehend and
   support the concepts and ideals of modern republican government. His
   system of thought differs from Paine's because it is not based upon
   government of, by, and for the people. Democracy in our political
   tradition is predicated on the will of the majority rather than the
   desires of the few. In Locke's thinking, the will of the people is
   precluded as the majority of individuals lack citizenship rights,
   including the right to vote. What Locke's philosophy supports is a
   medieval faith in limited monarchy. It is incomprehensible that one could
   embrace a political and social system dominated by royalty and the
   nobility and claim to be an advocate of republicanism. As a corollary, it
   is also illogical to believe that Locke's views on government and society
   are the source and model for American democracy. Paine's and Locke's
   social and political concepts lie at opposite ends of the speculative
   spectrum.

   If we look at a variety of interrelated factors in John Locke's thinking,
   such as, a medieval conception of the social and political orders, power
   in the hands of monarchs and aristorcrats, government not basedupon
   republican principles, absence of an independent an impartial court
   system, the majority being denied citizenship rights, preservation of
   property being the main motive that causes human beings to form
   governments, man's position under the social compact, pedigree and
   property determining one's opportunities and position in life, lack of a
   genuinely representative form of government, limited political and social
   freedoms, a society built upon an operated by despotic institutions, the
   state and civil society being coterminous; it becomes apparent that a wide
   intellectual and conceptual gulf exists between John Locke and Thomas
   Paine. If we add to the above components that represent Locke's thinking
   the lack of a true British constitution, it also becomes evident that all
   of these items whencombined do not reflect the thinking of Thomas Paine or
   a democratic life style. Again, it is difficult to look at the array of
   principles, opinions and concepts that John Locke embraced and believe
   that his thought system is the foundation of American society.

   Thomas Paine's writings and speeches altered Lockean philosophy in
   particular and European thought in general. A shift in thinking, in which
   man was regarded as free, equal and independent within society, resulted
   in a new political and social architecture. Paine's ideas and ideals not
   only transformed the philosophy of John Locke and the relationship between
   citizens and their government, they universalized the concept of
   revolution. Events in America might lead to the destruction and reordering
   of Europe's political and social arrangements. This is one reason Paine
   was looked upon as a threat to the stability and structure of the 18th
   century world. America's revolution would prove to be a harbinger of
   things to come.

   Many people in colonial America and in Europe considered Paine's agenda
   for government and society too liberal. Others felt his programs and
   proposals went beyond liberalism and were in essence anarchic. Thomas
   Paine did not view himself as being either liberal or radical. He simply
   believed that his ideas and efforts on behalf of freedom, equality and
   independence were a means of ushering in a new world order that would
   bring about the fulfillment of God's plan for humanity. The values of
   democracy were in harmony with the universal mind and natural law. They
   were capable of properly linking human beings to one another as well as to
   creation and their creator. Thomas Paine persuaded and impelled men to
   abolish the political and social structures under which they existed. His
   essay "Common Sense" convinced the colonists that separation from Great
   Britain and the formation of a republic were a necessity. This composition
   transformed public opinion and created the American Revolution. In fact,
   this publication is the dividing line between British American and the
   United States History. Thomas Paine's achievements are remarkable and
   transcend time and place. To give just one example, he wrote the three
   best-selling books of the 18th century (Common Sense, Rights of Man, and
   The Age of Reason). These works are the cornerstones of modern democracy
   as well as 21st century social and political thought.

   Thomas Paine was the most prodigious political and social polemicist of
   the revolutionary era. His thinking is far more original and seminal than
   he has been given credit for by historians. Its scope is immense which is
   one of many reasons why he is something much more than a "Political
   Propagandist" and "Pamphleteer". Such terms have been utilized in
   denigrating manner in order to limit Paine's significance as a creative
   force in American and World History. His thinking encompassed the past,
   present and future of mankind. Few people in history have affected and
   changed the world as much as Thomas Paine. John Adams, our second
   president, said that "History will ascribe the (American) Revolution to
   Thomas Paine".41 "Paine crystallized public opinion in favor of revolution
   and was the first factor in bringing about revolution".42 John Adams also
   stated, "I know not whether any man in the world had had more influence on
   its in habitants or affairs for the last 30 years than Tom Paine. Call it
   the age of Paine".43 It was apparent to many of Paine's contemporaries
   that the cause of the American Revolution and the creator of the structure
   and values of Modern Democracy was Thomas Paine and not John Locke. In
   fact, many highly intelligent men in both America and Europe perceived
   Paine as being one of the world's most creative and advanced minds. He was
   regarded by numerous prominent individuals as a man of genius who changed
   the nature and composition of government and society. Napoleon Bonaparte
   grasping Paine's impact on his era asserted, "Paine deserved a statue in
   gold in every town".44 Considering Paine's contributions to the formation
   of the American State and the direction of modern World History, his life
   needs to be reexamined in the light of honesty in order that he may
   receive the long overdue recognition and respect that he justly deserves.

    

   POSTSCRIPT

   "Among enemies and friends alike, Paine earned a reputation as a citizen
   extraordinary --- as the greatest political figure of his generation. He
   made more noise in the world and excited more attention than such
   well-known European contemporaries as Adam Smith, Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
   Voltaire, Immanuel Kant, Madame de Stael and Pietro Verri".45

   From TOM PAINE A POLITICAL LIFE

   By John Keane (Prologue)

   NOTE

   John Adams detested Thomas Paine. They were at opposite ends of the
   republican spectrum. Adams was conservative and Paine even by today's
   standards would be considered extremely liberal. However, one thing they
   did agree on was independence. Thomas Paine not only created modern
   liberalism, Eugene V. Debs in one of his speeches paid homage to the
   prophet of freedom by declaring that Paine isalso the father of the modern
   radical tradition in politics.
