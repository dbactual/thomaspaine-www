   Paine was the only leading Founder who served in both the military and the
   government during the Revolution. But more than that, it was Paine's
   *Common Sense* that transformed a tax rebellion into a social and political
   revolution. Paine provided the ideology of the American Revolution: an end to monarchy, establish a
   system of representative democracy, and the establishment of an independent and free America. As the Revolution
   faltered, in December 1776, Paine wrote the *American Crisis* and turned the
   tide and filled the ranks of the Continental Army, where he was serving as
   an officer, and was the voice of the Americans throughout the Revolution in the other *Crisis* papers. He later became the secretary to committee on foreign affairs, and personally brought the crucial support of France into the fight.
