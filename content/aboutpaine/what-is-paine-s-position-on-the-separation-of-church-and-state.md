   Since Paine believed that all organized religion was a tool to monopolize
   power and profit and to oppress the people, his belief in the separation
   of church and state was vehement.  Witnessing first hand England's use of
   the church to wield the king's power, he learned early on to keep religion
   out of government and maintained that position throughout his life. He
   influenced many Founders, including Jefferson, during the Revolution, and
   his writings led to this basic tenet in the American creed. Simply put:
   Paine emphasized reason as the means to effective government, and showed
   in The Age of Reason - Part I and elsewhere that organized religion was
   man-made and unreasonable.
