   The Celebration and Damnation of Thomas Paine
   -------

   By Alfred F. Young, award-winning historian on labor history and
   the American Revolution
    

   The following is a paper presented to TPNHA by Dr. Young as a basis for
   his speech at a conference we held in 1991 commemorating the 200th
   anniversary of Rights of Man in New Rochelle, NY. We have left the
   footnotes as presented.

   This paper is an earlier version of an article contained in Science Mind
   and Art (Kluwer Academic Pub.) in Nederlands, and then an article in
   Alfred Young's Liberty Tree (New York University Press, 2006) by Young
   entitled "The Celebration and Damnation of Thomas Paine" (the subtitle of
   this paper). We recommend Liberty Tree and this article for complete
   footnotes, and additional context.
    
        
   When Thomas Paine was buried in New Rochelle on June 10, 1809, no
   more than a dozen people were at the funeral, perhaps less: Willett Hicks,
   a Quaker who had been unsuccessful in getting the Society of Friends to
   accept Paine's request that he be laid to rest in their burial grounds in
   New York City; Thomas Addis Emmett, a Paineite political refugee
   imprisoned in Ireland now a rising lawyer in the city; two African
   American men, one perhaps the grave-digger; Margaret de Bonneville and her
   two young sons, Benjamin and Thomas, Paine's godson, all refugees from
   Napoleonic France who Paine had sustained in the United States - a
   repayment of the support she and her husband Nicholas had given Paine in
   France both before and after his imprisonment. All these had made the
   25-mile journey from Greenwich Village, then on the outskirts of New York,
   where Paine had died. A few friends from New Rochelle may have joined
   them. No political leaders attended; no one, it seems, gave a eulogy.
   Years later Madame de Bonneville recollected the poignant moment:

   "The internment was a scene to affect and wound any sensible heart.
   Contemplating who it was, what man it was, that we were committing him to 
   an obscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land, I could not help 
   feeling most acutely. Before the earth was thrown down around the coffin, 
   I placing myself at the east end of the grave, said to my son Benjamin, 
   `stand you there, at the other end, as a witness for America'. Looking 
   around me, and beholding the small group of spectators, I exclaimed, as 
   the earth was tumbled into the grave, `Oh! Mr. Paine! My son stands here 
   as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I, for France!'
    
        A few others doubtless had paid their last respects to Paine at
   Greenwich in response to a paragraph the day before by Jacob Frank, the
   editor, in the New York Public Advertiser inviting friends "to attend the
   funeral from (Paine's) late residence", but if so, it was not enough to
   write about in the papers. There was no memorial service in New York or
   any other city. There were only a few published tributes in newspapers
   edited by Jacobin refugees from British persecution, now successful
   Jeffersonians. New York politicians who had known Paine and his record,
   Vice President George Clinton and his nephew Dewitt Clinton, the Mayor of
   New York, were silent, as were the national leaders who had been his
   co-workers: Thomas Jefferson who had played host to him for a stay in the
   White House on his return from France in 1802; James Monroe who had
   intervened to free him from a French prison in 1795; Benjamin Rush who had
   given the title to Common Sense - silent, all of them. And when James
   Cheetham, the renegade Paineite editor, brought out his scurrilous
   biography of Paine later in 1809, it went unchallenged for years. Philip
   Freneau, alone among American writers of his day, paid Paine tribute in
   poetry.
    
        What had happened? Thomas Paine was the author of the three most
   widely read and influential pamphlets in the English language in the last
   quarter of the eighteenth century: Common Sense, Rights of Man, and The
   Age of Reason. In 1776 Common Sense, Paine rightly claimed, "awaked
   America to a declaration of Independence" [Paine Will in Foner ed.].
    During the war his American Crisis papers - "These are the times that try
   men's souls" - sealed his reputation as a leading patriot. Washington had
   them read to his troops. Congress appointed him Secretary to its Committee
   on Foreign Affairs. After the war while Congress never awarded him
   adequately financially, the State of New York granted him a 250 acre farm
   in New Rochelle confiscated from a Loyalist for his "eminent services" and
   "distinguished merit" in the Revolution. Rights of Man published in the
   1790's renewed his popular reputation.

        What explains Paine's fall from grace in the United States? The most
   commonly offered explanation lies in the response to The Age of Reason,
   the third of his best selling works which followed on the heels of Rights
   of Man in 1794 and 1795, circulated through the late 1790s. His attack on
   organized religion as the historical handmaiden of political oppression
   and on the Bible as superstition brought deism out of the gentlemen's
   drawing rooms to the common people as no other work before or since. But
   it probably eclipsed Rights of Man in the breadth and intensity of the
   reaction it provoked. [ft Marcus Daniel thesis on English response].

        When Paine returned to the United States in 1802 after a fifteen year
   absence he was greeted with a wave of abuse in which the dominant theme
   was religious blended with an attack on his private moral character. He
   was, to take the epithets only from the most genteel Federalist papers, "a
   lying, drunken, brutal infidel", "the loathsome Thomas Paine, a drunken
   atheist", "an obscene old sinner; he was "godless", "impious", "a
   blasphemer" [Knudson article NYHSQJ, Hawke].

        The attack on Paine struck roots among ordinary people. In Washington
   inn keepers refused to put Paine up and he finally entered one under an
   assumed name. At Trenton, one stagecoach driver refused to carry Paine to
   New York: "I'll be damned if he shall go on my stage." And another
   refused, saying, "My stage and horses were once struck by lightning, and I
   don't want them to suffer again." A minister who visited Paine in New York
   was disciplined. In New Rochelle mothers warned their children to stay
   away from Paine - he was a bad man. [Hawke}

        The religious explanation is appealing. The orthodox clergy attacked
   him with an unprecedented fury. Federalist leaders exploited the religious
   issue. And many Jeffersonian politicians, even closet deists, found
   Paine's irreligion politically embarrassing, especially because so many
   supporters of the party were evangelical Baptists and Methodists. The
   second great Awakening of the early 1800's sank roots among poorer farmers
   in the countryside and artisans and journeymen in the cities, the natural
   constituents of the Democratic Republicans. It may be that in the last
   analysis that Paine's deism sealed his fate.

        But was it so simple? I would like to offer three other hypotheses
   for the eclipse of Thomas Paine. [NB other scholars on this issue: Dixon
   Wecter, Eric Foner, Aldridge, Conway]. First, from the outset of his
   career Paine was under attack for his political radicalism. From 1776 to
   1794, long before The Age of Reason made its appearance, Paine was the
   target of one wing of the American conservative elite for his political
   views and he remained so throughout his life. Second, the failure of Paine
   to retain the popular reputation he won during the Revolution is part of
   the larger problem in American history of passing on the heritage of one
   generation to another, particularly the legacy of radical achievement. And
   third, Paine might be considered a "victim of the Rights of Man", a phrase
   Robert R. Palmer used some 40 years ago.[article] The election of
   Jefferson in 1801 and certainly his reelection in 1804, guaranteed the
   triumph of the core principles Paine advocated. Paine the person thus was
   a victim of the success of his political ideas. And in quite a different
   way he was a victim, of what might be called the limitations of 18th
   century radical thought in coping with the new social issues of the 19th
   century.

        To probe the seeming puzzle of the rejection of Paine in his last
   years we should try to unlock the secrets of his success. To make my case
   I would therefore like to tum to an exploration of the reception, first in
   Common Sense in 1776 and then of Rights of Man in the 1790s, first in the
   United States and then briefly in England and then return to the American
   scene from 1802 to 1809.
                                                                           I
      
        One needs Common Sense to understand Rights of Man. It was the basis
   of his subsequent reputation. On the title page of Rights of Man Paine
   identified himself as the author of Common Sense. More important, as Paine
   had no hesitation in admitting, the principles of Rights of Man "were the
   same as those in Common Sense ... The only difference between the two
   works was, that one was adapted to the local circumstances of England and
   the other to those in America [cited Clark 423]. Indeed the very structure
   of the argument of Part II and much of the language follow the first
   pamphlet.

        Common Sense has come down in history oversimply as an argument for
   American Independence. Actually the message to Americans was
   triple-barreled: independence, republicanism and empowerment of the common
   people. Abandon the goal of reconciliation with the mother country, he
   argued, and adopt the goal of independence; reject not only King George
   III but the principle of monarchy and put in its place republican
   government based on broad popular participation; and third - a message
   implicit in the medium addressed as it was to an audience of farmers and
   artisans - rely not on learned authorities but on your own reason, your
   own common sense.

        The tone of the writing was warmly equalitarian. "Male and female are
   the distinctions of nature, good and bad the distinctions of heaven; but
   how a race of men came into the world so exalted above the rest ... is
   worth inquiring into". "Of more worth is one honest man to society, and in
   the light of God than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived". [pg 16
   Foner ed]

        The tone was irreverent, often coarse. The first king was "nothing
   better than the principal ruffian of some restless gang". The claim of
   William the Conqueror, "a French bastard landing with an armed banditti
   and establishing himself king of England against the consent of the
   natives, in plain terms a very paltry rascally original. It certainly hath
   no divinity in it". [pg 14]

        And the appeal was suffused with a millennialist idealism, "We have
   it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation similar to the
   present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now. The birthday
   of a new world is at hand ..." [pg 45 Foner edn]

        It is these combined qualities that account for the phenomenal
   popularity of the pamphlet. If its success was not quite as Paine
   proclaimed - "beyond anything since the invention of printing" - it very
   likely was read by or read to a large share of the adult white male
   population colonies. Paine who could observe something of the printing
   history from the vantage point of Philadelphia (in effect the capital),
   claimed 120,000 copies by April, 1776; which he reduced (not necessarily
   accurately), to 100,000 in a footnote in Rights of Man in 1792. Scholars
   have generally accepted a circulation of 100,000 to 150,000 (although it
   is not at all clear how they reached their conclusions). [Footnote] This
   was in a country of about 2,500,000 (500,000 of whom were slaves) and in
   which some 200,000 men served in the militia or regular army over seven
   years of war. The pamphlet was cheap - one shilling, which put it in the
   category of the lowest priced publications. And it was relatively short,
   usually less than 60 pages, and arranged in four systematic chapters.

        The pamphlet went through some 35 separate printings (counting the
   various editions), 15 in Philadelphia, 16 in New England cities and towns,
   almost all between January and June, 1776. Boastful as he was, there was
   something to Paine's claim in April, 1776, that there was "never a
   pamphlet since the use of letters ... of which so great a number went off
   in so short a time" [Forester pamphlet]. Pamphlets were one of the
   principal forms of expression in the revolutionary decade; prior to Paine,
   the best seller may have been John Dickinson's pamphlet with a circulation
   of 15,000. [Bailyn?] A sale of a few thousand was more common. A wealth of
   anecdotal evidence from sources high and low attest to the enormous
   popularity of Common Sense early in 1776. [cite several letters]

        It was successful because it came at precisely the time when masses
   of people were ready for its message. A war was on. Tens of thousands of
   men were in action in the militia or the new regular army. Committees were
   forming everywhere. British government was collapsing as provincials were
   erecting in effect a dual government. The prospect of reconciliation with
   Britain was running out. A war was on but what were the Americans fighting
   for?
        In weighing influence, the active role of the reader is often
   unappreciated. Reading is an act of volition. People had to buy the
   pamphlet; one shilling was cheap as pamphlets went but costly to a
   housewright who might make 3/ or 4/ a day or a weaver, tailor or carpenter
   who made even less. [Jackson Main p 77; Billy Smith article]. Or when it
   was read aloud, a person had to make a decision to come to listen or stay
   to hear it out.

        As one soldier remembered it [Ashbel Green memoir] Common Sense
   "struck a string which required but a touch to make it vibrate". Joseph
   Hawley, a leader in western Massachusetts said it somewhat differently:
   "every sentiment has sunk into my well prepared heart" [Foner pg 86]. Thus
   John Adams was accurate in his recollection years later, even if he was
   putting down Paine that "the idea of independence was familiar, even among
   the common people, much earlier than some persons pretend" and that the
   first idea of independence was not "suggested to them by the pamphlet
   Common Sense". [pg 88 Rush Adams Correspondence]

        Paine's special contribution - which Adams could not abide - was to
   crystallize this mounting sentiment for independence, link it to
   republicanism, and, to use the lingo of the late twentieth century, lift
   the consciousness of the "common people" to a more democratic level.

        What Adams well knew was that Paine's pamphlet precipitated a
   three-cornered debate. The first between the opponents and advocates of
   independence - between Paine and some now forgotten Tory pamphleteers -
   was easily won and was irrelevant after July 4, 1776. The second was among
   patriots as to what kind of a republic should replace British rule and
   this continued through the revolutionary era and into the 1790's. Here the
   debate was explicitly between Paine and a host of radical democrats on the
   one hand and conservative patriots like John Adams and Carter Braxton of
   Virginia on the other. From the outset Adams was ambivalent about Paine's
   message. Years later he vividly remembered his mood in 1776:

   "The arguments in favor of Independence I liked very well [but] the part 
   relative to a form of government I considered as flowing from simple 
   ignorance, and a mere desire to please the Democratic party in Philadelphia 
   ... I dreaded the effect so popular a pamphlet might have ... His plan was 
   so democratical without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium 
   or counterpoise." [diary]

        Very soon Adams circulated in manuscript his own "Thoughts on
   Government" which he put into print to instruct patriot leaders in
   drafting constitutions for the newly independent states. Paine's ideals
   led to the Pennsylvania constitution, the most democratic of all: a one
   house legislature elected annually by a broad taxpayer suffrage with no
   property qualifications for office holding, a weak executive, laws passed
   only after the legislature allowed them to circulate among the
   people. Adams's ideals were embodied in the Massachusetts Constitution of
   1780 he helped draft: a legislature with two branches with graduated
   property qualifications for office holding and voting; a governor with a
   high property qualification; and an independent judiciary. The two houses
   would check and balance each other and the Governor could veto their
   laws. Adams's plan made numerous concessions to the town meeting democracy
   of New England; but a fundamental principle was respect for persons in
   authority - the antithesis of Paine's egalitarianism. [Page Smith; Elisha
   Douglass]

        What Adams detested most in Paine was what he called his
   "impudence". He had a taste of it in his own family. In March, '76 out of
   the blue, Adams' wife, Abigail wrote to him to "remember the ladies" in
   recasting a code of laws for America. "Do not put such unlimited power
   into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all men would be tyrants if they
   could". Adams playfully put her down. He was shocked. Everyone was casting
   off deference. "We have been told that our struggle has loosened the bonds
   of government everywhere. That children and Apprentices were disobedient -
   that schools and colleges were grown turbulent - that Indians slighted
   their Guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their masters". "Depend upon
   it, we know better than to repeal our masculine systems". It could not
   have been lost upon John Adams that Abigail had read the copy of Common
   Sense he had sent her the month before. [Young article on Women of Boston]

        In 1819, forty years later smoke still came out of his ears as Adams
   fumed about the pamphlet. "What a poor, ignorant, malicious, short-sighted
   crapulous mass is Tom Paine's Common Sense." [Letters 1819, Hawke]
    
                                                                           II
    
        In the 1790's Rights of Man revived the conflict between the two
   types of republicanism epitomized in the 1776 debate between Paine and
   Adams. To understand the celebration and damnation of Rights of Man two
   contexts are needed: the history of the fifteen years gone by and the
   history of Federalist policies of the 1790's providing new "strings which
   required but a touch to vibrate". Without these it is a puzzle why Rights
   of Man should have been popular at all in the United States.   Paine wrote
   both Part I and Part II in England for an English audience. Part I was a
   lengthy, discursive defense of the French Revolution in response to the
   arguments by an English politician, Edmund Burke. It had neither the
   immediacy nor the style of Common Sense. Part II, (with the exception of
   Ch 5) was a restatement of Common Sense, which set up the American
   political system as a model for England to follow. Why should such a work
   have become so popular in the United States?

        Let me in a kind of historical shorthand offer my sense of what
   happened between 1776 and 1789 in the struggle between the two kinds of
   republicanism. During the Revolution patriot elites - the would-be ruling
   classes - divided in their strategy as to how to deal with the democratic
   tide that overflowed all banks. Some were advocates of accommodation, some
   were advocates coercion or repression. Two New York aristocrats illustrate
   the difference. Robert R. Livingston, Jr., head of the great landed family
   of the Hudson Valley, was convinced "of the propriety of Swimming with a
   stream which it is impossible to stem"; he advised his colleagues "that
   they should yield to the torrent if they hoped to direct its course." On
   the other hand, Gouverneur Morris, the young son of the owner of the
   tenanted estate of Morrisania which embraced a good part of Westchester,
   used the metaphor of a snake to describe the popular movement. Staring at
   a vast demonstration of mechanics and tradesmen in New York City, he
   wrote: "The mob begins to think and reason. Poor reptiles. It is with them
   a vernal morning; they are struggling to cast off their winter's slough,
   they bask in the sunshine and ere none they will bite, depend on it ...
   They fairly contended about the future forms of our government, whether it
   should be founded upon aristocratic or democratic principles." A snake had
   to be scotched. Others compared the people to a horse which had to be
   whipped. John Adams sometimes leaned towards accommodation, sometimes
   towards coercion. [Young, Democratic Republicans, and articles 1981, 1990]

        The first New York State constitution was, in the words of John Jay,
   a "perfect blend of the aristocratic and democratic". Much the same could
   be said of Adams's Massachusetts constitution and the federal constitution
   which emerged in 1787. The federal convention at Philadelphia was
   dominated by the gentry who had been tutored by men like Adams in the
   virtues of a balanced government. Many framers were intrigued by Alexander
   Hamilton's extremist proposal for a president elected for life, a senate
   elected for life, a house for two year terms and a president with the
   power to appoint the state governors and veto state laws. Gouverneur
   Morris was enthusiastic. But the framers as a whole knew that a government
   of King, Lords and Commons was not suited to what James Madison called
   "the genius of the people" - we would say spirit of the people - which was
   much more Paineite. And so they adopted a more accommodating
   middle-of-the-road conservative plan which pleased John Adams no end but
   left Thomas Paine - now off in Paris - dissatisfied. Paine swallowed his
   objections because any national government was better than the weak
   confederation as long as it provided the means for future amendment. In
   1787-88 the Federalists under the leadership of Madison were
   accommodaters. In 1789 they accommodated the democratic opponents of the
   constitution still further by adding a Bill of Rights.
       
                                                               III
    
        The Rights of Man won an audience in the 1790's because the
   Federalists in power moved away from accommodation towards coercion.
   Federalists strung the "strings" which Rights of Man could "vibrate"
   First, they attempted to give the government what they called a "high
   tone", raising the seemingly dead issues of aristocracy and monarchy.
   Federalists toyed with the idea of titles. Adams as Vice President asked
   the Senate whether he should address George Washington as "His most benign
   highness,' or "His elective highness". Some irreverent Senators suggested
   Adams might be called the "Duke of Braintree" (his home town) or "His
   Rotundity." But the cat was out of the bag, and Adams, undismayed, was
   soon in print with a series of articles justifying titles as necessary to
   create an aura of dignity around officials to command the respect of the
   common people. [Senator MacClay; Page Smith]
    
       Second, Hamilton by his financial policies-- funding the national
   debt, assuming the state debts, chartering a Bank of the United States
   based on stock with certificates of debt -  by a wave of the Secretary of
   the Treasury's wand, created a monied interest to support the national
   government. Consciously modeled after the British, his system raised
   questions as to whether the United States was adopting the corruption it
   had abandoned. Moreover the taxes to raise this grand Hamiltonian edifice
   seemed to fall heavily on farmers.
    
        Federalist foreign policies provided a third string to vibrate. The
   French Revolution at first was not a partisan issue; France had been
   America's indispensable ally in the revolution and a formal French
   alliance was still in place. But as the French revolution moved to the
   left establishing a republic, as the republic practised the regicide
   Americans had done symbolically in '76 as a radical reform movement
   threatened revolution in Great Britain; as France and Britain went to war,
   two contrasting philosophies of government were at stake. The Federalists
   by pursuing a policy of economic and ideological alliance with Britain,
   brought the French Revolution into American politics. By1791-92 the
   coalition that Washington held together was fracturing on the national
   level as Jefferson and Madison parted company with Hamilton. From 1792 to
   1794 popular opposition to the internal excise taxes on the farmer's
   production of whiskey was in full bloom. In '93 the splits over the French
   Revolution moved to center stage,  in the '95 po1icy to Great Britain. By
   1795 more than 40 Democratic Republican Societies were in existence.
   Electoral battles f o r Congress underway in '94 were in f u l l swing in
   '95 as Jefferson challenged Adams for the presidency.
    
        Repression rapidly replaced accommodation as Federalist policy. They
   sent an army to put down the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania, attempted
   in Congress to "censure" the Democratic Socit.ies as "self created" ,
   condemned the crowds demonstrating against Jay's Treaty with Great Britain
   as "the swinish multitude " and ended up in l798 passing the Alien and
   Sedition Laws under which they could prosecute criticism of the government
   as sedition.
    
        Thus Rights of Man thus unintentionally could vibrate the same
   American strings that Common Sense had plucked.  Once again Paine blasted
   away at monarchy: "If I ask the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant,
   the tradesman and down through all the occupations of  life to the common
   laborer, what service is monarchy to him? He can give me no answer"
   (326-327). Yet John Adams and Alexander Hamilton had defended the system
   of King, Lord and Commons as appropriate for Great Britain enough to give
   an American resonance to Paine's attack.
    
        Paine went after what he called the "farce of titles " which Adams
   had openly advocated. "Titles are like circles drawn by the magicians
   wand," wrote Paine, "to contract the sphere of man's felicity. He lives
   immured within the Bastille of a word, and surveys at a distance the
   envied life of man" (p 287). Paine was merciless to the hereditary
   principle in language that struck sparks with Americans who sought
   recognition on the basis of achievement. "Hereditary succession is a
   burlesque upon monarchy.... It requires some talents to be a common
   mechanic, but to be a king, requires only the animal figure of a man-a
   sort of breathing automaton" (p 356). Paine had harsh words for the
   English funding system which his American readers could construe against
   its Hamiltonian imitation . Most important, Paine returned again and again
   to the theme of the "excess and inequality of taxation." His target was
   always Britain; in America, he thought, "Their taxes are few because their
   government is just. There the poor are not oppressed, the rich are not
   privileged" (p 360) But to farmers in western Pennsylvania and Kentucky
   ready to tar and feather excise tax collectors such lines may have been
   more an incitement than comfort.
    
        Paine linked the cost of  monarchy and aristocracy to taxation. He
   framed the issue for the individual as "whether the fruits of his labor
   shall be enjoyed by himself, or consumed by the profligacy of governments"
   (p 404), and in so doing he touched a deep nerve among American farmers
   which when rubbed raw had contributed to agrarian rebellions and the
   American Revolution. It is also entirely likely that Paine's remarkable
   chapter 5 in Part II, addressing the "mass of wretchedness" in civilized
   countries-- "we see age going to the work-house and youth to the
   gallows"-- also resonated in America. One might not be "shocked by ragged
   and hungry children and persons of seventy and eighty years of age begging
   for bread" that Paine described for England. But in the seaboard cities
   the poor houses and poor relief were often strained, and hard put
   journeymen conducted the first strikes against master artisans. And
   unquestionably there were as Paine wrote, "a considerable number of
   middling tradesmen who having lived decently in the former part of  life,
   [who] begin, at age approaches to lose their business and at last fall
   into decay." In 1818 when Congress got around to pensions for veterans of
   the Revolution, restricting them to those "in the lowest grade of
   poverty", 20,000 men applied. Such men and women might well have responded
   to Paine's plan in chapter 5 for a system of old age pensions, education,
   child subsidies,--the liniments of the welfare state .
    
        Paine no less in the 1790s than in 1776 appealed to the idealism,
   indeed the millennial streak among Americans. "It is an age of revolutions
   in which everything may be looked for" (p 344). And everything was not
   confined to governments. "When it shall be said in any country in the
   world, my poor are happy; neither ignorance nor distress is to be found
   among them; my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the
   aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive; the rational world is
   my friend because I am a friend of its happiness--when these things can be
   said then may that country boast of its constitution and its government."
   ( p 446)
    
    
        That Rights of Man thus had the potential to reach a wide audience in
   the United States is clear. Exactly how popular was it? There is no study
   of the publishing history of the pamphlet in the United States. It clearly
   was one of the most widely circulated titles of the I790s.  How many
   copies is difficu1t to say. This time neither Paine - who was in England
   until 1792 and in France until 1802 - nor any other contemporary made a
   claim for the total sales in the United States.  The frequency and
   location of printings offers the best clue. Printers were in business to
   make money. Whatever their politics, they could not afford to bring out
   non sellers. [Botein; Eliz Reilly thesis]
    
        Using the standard bibliographic guides [Evans; Mooney-Shipton] I
   count about 26 printings of Rights of Man, 12 of part I in seven different
   cities and I9 of Part II in six cities, plus several combined printings of
   Parts I and II.   If the circulation statistics are beyond recovery, there
   are several clues as its popularity. The multiple editions were in the
   large coastal cities, primarily New York and Philadelphia but there were
   also editions in small towns where printers had distribution networks into
   the countryside ( Bennington, Vt, CarlisIe, Penn., Albany, New York and
   New London, Conn.). Secondly, beginning in 1792 and especially in 1794
   printers were willing to risk bringing out the collected works of Paine in
   two volumes. The Albany printers acted {or a consortium of printers at
   Lansingburgh, Hudson, Poughkeepsie and New York. Third in Federalist
   Bogton T and J Fleet who catered to the poor with broadside ballads and
   chap books, advertised a "cheap edition in two parts stitched together at
   only 3 shillings" (still cheap allowing for inflation since the 1 shilling
   price of Common Sense in 1776).   My guess, taking into account all of
   these printings is that Rights of Man had a total circulation of from
   50,000 to 100,000.  But this does not measure its full readership. It was
   stocked by circulating libraries; about 266 were in existence by 1800. And
   passages were frequently reprinted in the newspapers which grew in number
   from about 100 in 1790 to 230 in 1800.
    
        The Age of Reason. to get a comparison in place, followed from 1794
   to 1796 with 18 printings in five cities , seven in New York by John
   Fellows, the deist. Even Isaiah Thomas America's most successful printer,
   ever attuned to what would sell, whether it was Mother Goose or Fanny Hill
   , brought out two printings in Worcester in central Massachusetts,
   Congregational and Baptist country.   In the l790s it probably did not
   match Rights of Man in number of copies, although if the number of titles
   published directly against it are a measure, it was far more provocative.
    
   Measuring the impact of all these copies of Rights of Man is difficult.
   Unlike Common Sense, it was not focused on a single goal like independence
   and it circulated over a longer period of time. It began as a cause
   celebre because of the brouhaha over the first printing of Part I in
   Philadelphia. Madison sent Jefferson his copy, one of the first to arrive
   from England, Jefferson by agreement sent it to S. H. Smith, the printer,
   with a note  he claimed he did not intend for publication which Smith ran
   as a preface: "I am extremely pleased to find it will be reprinted here,
   and that something is at length to be publicly said against the political
   heresies which have sprung up amongus. I have no doubt our citizens will
   rally a second time round the standard of Common Sense".  Jefferson of
   course had John Adams in mind. Adams obligingly put the shoe on. "I detest
   that book and its tendency from the bottom of my heart" he wrote privately
   in 1791. Curbing himself, he allowed his son John Quincy to take on Paine
   writing as "PubIicola" (which everyone took to be Adams himself).
   Republican writers took up the gauntlet and the controversy was hot and
   heavy in the newspapers. It was as if all the characters in the political
   play had taken their assigned parts, dramatizing the issues Paine was
   discussing . In l791 shortly after Part I appeared Jefferson wrote
   enthusiastically to Paine from the capitol at Philadelphia that it was
   "much read here with avidity and pleasure," but I can not match this with
   comment for the rest of the decade.
    
        There are several measures of its impact. One lies in the toasts that
   were a common feature of political celebrating on the fourth of July or
   victories of the French Revolution. Toasts in New York may well be
   representative. In New York City in mid July 1792 the Tammany Society-- a
   fraternal order rising in its liberalism-toasted "The Clarion of
   Freedom--Thomas Paine" and by December "The Citizen of the Wor1d, Thomas
   Paine." The General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen toasted, "The
   mechanic, Thomas Paine". On July 4, 1793, the Mechanics, Tammany and the
   Democrats in a joint celebration sang a song "The Rights of Man" which
   dwelled on the nexus of aristocracy to taxes:
    
   "Luxurious pomp, which brings taxes and woes

   No more we'll maintain with the sweat of our brows."

   and ended

   "To conclude-- Here's success to Honest TOM PAINE

   May he live to enjoy what he well does explain."

   After 1795 the toasts to Paine seem to fade and when they reappeared again
   in 1797 it was in a toast from the Patriotic Junior Association which
   showed that the process of disassociation from deism was underway: "Thomas
   Paine: May his Rights of Man be handed down to our latest posterity but
   may his Age of Reason never live to see the rising generation". [Young Dem
   Repos book; Simon Newman toasts kindly provided from thesis l991; P Foner
   toasts]
    
        A second measure of the influence of the pamphlet is the usage of the
   phrase "the rights of man". On July Fourth celebrations which were rapidly
   becoming Democratic-Republican festivals, there invariably was a toast to
   the "The Rights of Man" but the reference, I think, trag less to the book
   than to the concept which Paine's title unquestionably had popularized.
    In the 1760's and 1770's Americans were defending their "liberties" or
   their "rights as Englishmen", then their "natural rights" The phrase
   "rights of man" does not seem to have entered the American political
   vocabulary until the 1790's with the French Revolution and thanks to
   Paine's pamphlet.
    
   Finally the rhetoric of the democratic-republican societies, some forty to
   fifty of which made their appearance between 1793 and l797, measure
   Paine's influence. The largest and most influential clubs were in the
   cities where their membership was overwhelmingly drawn from mechanics and
   tradesmen but included merchants and lawyers. But they were also in
   smaller cities and country towns, some four in Vermont, two on the
   Pennsylvania frontier, three in Kentucky, five in South Carolina. They did
   not, as Federalists charged, owe their founding to Paine or Citizen Genet.
   Yet as one reads through their statements of principles and resolutions it
   is impossible not to feel that these were the work of writers who had read
   Paine. And one can say the same of the more numerous Fourth of July
   orations under Republican auspices. [Eugene Link; P. Foner, ed documents]
   
        A comparison of the response to Rights of Man in the United States to
   Great Britain sets off both. The pamphlet almost did for the British what
   Common Sense had done for Americans in 1776. In the l790's, we have it on
   the commanding authority of E.P Thompson, "something like an 'English
   Revolution' took place" [Making 177]. And in this Paine's pamphlets played
   a decisive role.  Edmund Burke's Reflections on the French Revolution to
   which Part I of Rights of Man was addressed, sold an estimated 30,000
   copies in two years. Part I sold 50,000 copies in 1791 and by 1793 Parts I
   and II together, Thompson is convinced, sold 200,000 copies in England,
   Wales and Scotland. In a population of 10,000,000, this was "in a true
   sense phenomenal." Part I was priced at 3 shillings, part II sold at 6
   pence.
    

        The pamphlet reached deep into the laboring classes. One could not
   write for the United States a paragraph comparable to Thompson's summary
   for England: 

   In Sheffield it was said that 'every cutler' had a copy. At
   Newcastle , Paine's publications were said to be 'in almost
   every hand' and in particular those of the journeymen
   potters: "more than two thirds of this populous neighborhood
   are ripe for revolt, especially the lower class inhabitants ".
   Pai ne's book was found in Cornish tin-mines,
   in Mendip villager , in the Scottish highlands, and a little
   later in most parts of Ireland . . . The book, wrote an English
   correspondent "is now made as much a standard book in this
   country as Robinson Crusoe & the Pilgrim's Progress"
   .
   Small wonder then that the government indicted Paine for sedition and
   after he fled to France tried him and found him guilty in absentia.
   [Thompson 107-108] The movement for radical reform was suppressed but the
   book became in the l9th-century in Thompson's words "a foundation text of
   the British working class'' together with The Age of Reason.
    
        The influence of Rights of Man in America, thus it could be argued
   was neither as widespread nor as intense nor did it sink roots as deeply
   among the laboring classes and the poor. Rather it percolated through a
   democratic movement over a period of years, helping to set its tone. Paine
   was simply not as much of a hero in America in the 1790's as he was in
   Britain or as he had been in America in the l770's. And perhaps this helps
   to explain why he failed to consolidate his reputation.
    
                                                                           IV
    
        Let me return now to the hypotheses I suggested to explain the
   eclipse of Paine in 1809.
    
       First the question of Paine's deism. Given the long history of
   political opposition to Paine, The Age of Reason was a god-send to his
   enemies, to use a phrase that would not have found favor with Paine. The
   attack on it was essentially political. Paine got the nub of it a letter
   to Samuel Adams in l803. "Al1 this war whoop of the pulpit has some
   concealed object. Religion is not the cause but is the stalking horse.
   They put it forward to conceal themselves behind it." [Foner, ed 1436]
     
        William Duane, the Paineite editor of the Philadelphia Aurora, put it
   this way:"It is not Thomas Paine's want of religion but his want of faith
   in kings and priests that has made him the object of Tory detestation."
   [180l Aldrich 277]  "His religious sentiments have been denounced for
   political puroses and nothing else" . [1803] John Adams offered a
   backhanded confirmation. "His political writings, " he wrote in 1810, "I
   am singular to believe, have done more harm than his irreligious ones. He
   understands neither government nor religion" [to Rush.1810 p 156-57 Koch].
    
         The antagonism of evangelical religion to deism was real but we
   should not exaggerate it. During the revolutionary era in America at key
   moments there had been an alliance of evangelicals and deists. The
   Philadelphia radicals drew from both groups; even in Boston Samuel Adams,
   the Puritan politician, protected from religious wrath his lieutenant Dr.
   Thomas Young, the deist who had been tried for blasphemy in New York and
   whose book Reason the OnIv Oracle of Man co-authored with Ethan Allen
   would be published after the Revolution. [Maier article] Allen himself was
   the deist leader of the movement of Congregationalist and Baptist settlers
   of Vermont who shared a common hatred of New York landlord aristocrats.
   [Belleseills thesis] And in Virginia Jefferson, the gentleman deist, and
   Madison formed an alliance with the state's dissenting sects in a common
   cause of separating church and state which led to the famous Statute for
   Religious Liberty in 1796.  [Malone on TJ] Baptists all over remembered
   this and later voted for Jefferson. After 1801 the Baptists of Connecticut
   paid homage to their benefactor by sending a mammoth 400 pound cheese to
   President Jefferson in the White House. [Butterfield article]
    
        Paine himself was aware of the common stake in religious liberty of
   deists and evangelicals in the election campaign for Jefferson in the Fall
   of 1804. In the sleepy fishing village of Stonington, Connecticut Paine
   was visited by a group of Baptists who included three ministers: "They cry
   out against Mr. Jefferson because they say he is a deist," a Baptist spoke
   up. "Well a deist may be a good man, and if he think it right, it is right
   to him. For my own part I had rather vote for a deist than a blue-skin
   Presbyterian." (a reference to the rigid Connecticut blue laws)
       
        "You judge right", Paine responded, "for a man that is not of any of
   the sectaries will hold the balance between all; but give power to a bigot
   of any sectary and he will use it to the oppression of the rest, as the
   blue skins do in Connecticut [Hawke,m p 371 from Foner vol II 1459-060]
    
        Equally important there was a species of evangelical who blended the
   Bible with Paine. Thompson has called attention to them, in Wales, for
   example: "itinerant methodist preachers who descant on the Rights of Man
   and attack Kingly government" [EPT 108]. Nathan Hatch has identified them
   in the United States. Lorenzo Dow, the Methodist circuit rider, who
   according to Hatch "preached to more people, travelled more miles, and
   consistently attracted larger audiences to camp meetings than any preacher
   in his day" . . . " could begin a sermon by quoting Tom Paine." Dow wrote
   a pamphlet Analects upon the Rights of Man which breathed Paine's
   egalitarianism. They shared a "deep seated aversion to traditional
   inquiry", (Hatch, Democratization book,36-37)
    
        The religious issue functioned to divide the Jeffersonians. True
   believers were hostile. Unitarians like Joseph Priestly wanted to
   disassociate their liberalism from radicalism. [Marcus Daniel thesis] And
   the Jeffersonian politicians fearful of losing their constituents were
   scared off. Unwilling to come out of the closet with their deism, such
   politicians were unwilling to take a stand on the principle that religion
   was a matter of private opinion. [see Hawke p 353].
    
        Second, Paine's fading from public memory made possible the attack
   that isolated him. This was part of the larger problem of passing on the
   experience of one generation to another, a persistent problem which
   shocked the revolutionary generation no less than generations before and
   since. Paine put his finger on it in 1806 after he suffered the
   humiliation of the New Rochelle election inspectors denying him the right
   to vote on grounds (inspired by Federalists like Gouverneur Morris) that
   he was not an American citizen. He beseeched Vice President George Clinton
   for support "As it is a new generation that has risen up since the
   declaration of independence, they know nothing of what the political state
   of the country was at the time the pamphlet Common Sense appeared; and
   besides this there are but few of the old standers left and known that I
   know of in this city," NewYork..[Conway 307]
    
        The institutions that pass on heritage: historians, historical
   societies, museums, were in their infancy and those underway were often
   under the auspices of conservative gentry. Fourth of July orations passed
   on historical abstractions. The tens of thousands of veterans of the
   Revolution passed on largely their personal experiences by oral
   transmission. The year Paine died, even conservatives like John Adams were
   complaining of "a very extraordinary and unaccountable inattention in our
   countrymen to the History of their own country". The "original historians"
   of colonial times were very much neglected" and patriots like Samuel Adams
   and John Hancock were "almost buried in oblivion" [Adams ms Chi Hist Soc;
   also Page Smith] Adams, of course was, especially jealous of his own place
   in history, overshadowed as he had always been by great men Washington,
   Franklin, Jefferson, and defeated in public opinion by men like Paine. But
   in general most of the men whose chief claim to fame lay in the making of
   the Revolution were being cast aside in favor of George Washington, the
   nation builder. Parson Weems life of Washington replete with its
   fabricated cherry tree stories was on the way to becoming the best selling
   historical work of the 19th century. To recover the heritage of Paine the
   radical would require the reappearance of radical movements - British and
   German immigrant working class radicals, freethinkers and deists. And has
   it not been ever thus? [Mark Lause article; Sean Wilentz;Michael Kammen]
    
        Finally, Paine, as others have suggested, was the victim of the
   success of his ideas. There was never a serious prospect of monarchy in
   America. As Paine put it, "If I ask a man in America if he wants a king,
   he retorts, and asks me if I take him for an idiot" [Foner 326-27]. The
   idea of a hereditary aristocracy never took root; see the fate of the
   Society of Cincinatti. Mathew Lyon, the Vermont Congressman who had been
   found guilty of Sedition in 1799 for assailing John Adams for "his
   unbounded thirst for ridiculous Pomp" was reelected to congress from jail
   while John Adams was retired to private life. In l80l the coercive school
   of American conservatism was defeated and Jefferson, Madison, the
   accommodators, took over and even new school Federalists tried
   accommodation [David Fischer]. Hamilton out of power reflected ruefully
   "This American world was not for me".
    
        It was not that the principles of Rights of Man were irrelevant. The
   Jacobin refugees from English persecution who established themselves as
   Jeffersonian editors and politicians in American cities took up the causes
   of expanding suffrage, reforming the judicial system, eliminating English
   common law and expanding education. [Twomey book] But had not the core of
   his ideas triumphed?
    
       
        Neither Paine nor the middle class bearers of his 18th century
   radicalism were prepared to extend the principles of Book II ch 5 of
   Rights of Man to do battle in a war on poverty. The
   causes of poverty to Paine lay in corrupt governments redistributing the
   "fruits of labor" of the common people via unjust taxes. Neither Paine nor
   the Paineites were prepared in the first decade of the 19th century to
   take up the cause of journeymen shoemakers, printers, or furniture makers
   as they went out on strike against the poverty created by master artisans
   or take up the cause of women workers in the sweatshops,   much less the
   families of women and children in the new textile mills of Rhode Island
   and Massachusetts.  There was a mote in Paine's eye in his utopian
   optimism about America, that may have blinded him to the harshest
   realities of American life. Others would take up these causes in the next
   generation.
    
        Perhaps it is fitting to allow John Adams, Paine's life-long foe to
   offer the final testimony. Adams is a strange witness to call for the
   defense.  Paine was Adams's nemesis in 1776, in 1791,  even in 180l , his
   ideas contributing to Adams 's defeat.   Adams's judgment was not always
   reliable; he often used hyperbole and he clearly was vitriolic, but over
   the decades he had calibrated Paine's influence the way a seismograph
   tracks an earthquake. In 1805 a friend had written Adams using the phrase
   the "Age of Reason" to refer to the era of the American and French
   Revolutions.. Adams was beside himself.   "Call it the Age of Folly, Vice,
   Frenzy, Fury Brutality . . . or the age of the burning brand from the
   bottomless Pitt...anything but the age of Reason."  Then he made a quick
   leap. "I know not whether any man in the world has had more influence on
   its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine. There
   can be no severer satyr [satire?] on the age. For such a mongrel between
   pigs and puppy, begotten by a wild boar on a bitch wolf,  never before in
   any age of the world was suffered by the Poltroonery of Mankind to run
   through such a career of mischief. Call it then the Age of Paine". [ in
   147-48 collected Koch; check against original for sp of satyr].
