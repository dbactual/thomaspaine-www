   Preface to Rickman's "Life"

   The two following letters are explanatory of the reasons why the
   publication of the life of Mr. Paine has been so long delayed, and are so
   well calculated to excite the candor of the reader toward the work, that
   no apology is offered for making them a part of the preface.

   "To the Editor of the Universal Magazine:

   [November, 1811.]

   "On Mr. Clio Rickman's Supposed Undertaking of the 'Life of Thomas Paine'

   "Sir: The public has been, within the last year or two, led to expect a
   Life of the celebrated Thomas Paine, from the pen of Mr. Clio Rickman,
   well known, on various accounts, to be more thoroughly qualified for that
   task than any other person in this country.

   "This information, however, I repeat as I received it, uncertain whether
   it came abroad in any authenticated shape; and can only add, that no doubt
   need be entertained of sufficient attention from the public in times like
   the present, to a well-written life of that extraordinary character, whose
   principles and precepts are at this moment in full operation over the
   largest and richest portion of the habitable globe, and which in regular
   process of time may, from the efficacious influence of the glorious
   principles of freedom, become the grand theater of civilization.

   "I have often desired to make a communication of this kind to your
   magazine, but am particularly impelled thereto at this moment, from
   observing in some periodical publications devoted to political and
   religious bigotry, a sample of their usual sophistical accounts of the
   last moments of men who have been in life eminent for the independence and
   freedom of their opinions; but the whole that the bigot to whom I allude
   has been able to effect in the case of Mr. Paine, amounts to an
   acknowledgment that the philosopher died steadfast to those opinions of
   religion in which he had lived; and the disappointment is plain enough to
   be seen, that similar forgeries could not, with any prospect of success,
   be circulated concerning Paine's tergiversation and death-bed conversion,
   which were so greedily swallowed for a length of time by the gulls of
   fanaticism respecting Voltaire, D'Alembert, and others, until the Monthly
   Review, in the real spirit of philosophy, dispelled the imposition.

   "The late 'Life of Thomas Paine' by Cheetham of New York, gave rise to the
   above magazine article. Cheetham, humph! Now should it not rather be
   spelled Cheat'em, as applicable to every reader of that farrago of
   imposition and malignity, miscalled the 'Life of Paine'?

   "Probably it may be but a traveling name in order to set another book
   a-traveling, for the purpose of scandalizing and maligning the reputation
   of a defunct public man, instead of the far more difficult task of
   confuting his principles.

   "Nothing can be more in course than this conjecture, authorized indeed by
   the following fact, with which I believe the public is, to this day,
   unacquainted; namely, that Mr. Chalmers publicly at a dinner acknowledged
   himself the author of that very silly and insipid catchpenny, formerly
   sent abroad under the misnomer of a 'Life of Thomas Paine, by F. Oldys, of
   America.'

   "The chief view of this application is to ascertain whether or not Mr.
   Rickman really intends to undertake the work in question.

   "I am, Sir, etc., etc.

   "Politicus."

   -----------------------------

   Universal Magazine, December, 1811.

   "Mr. Clio Rickman's Reply to Politicos

   "Sir: If you had done me the favor of a call, I would readily have
   satisfied all your inquiries about the 'Life of Mr. Paine.'

   "It is true I had the memoirs of that truly wise and good man in a great
   state of forwardness about a year ago; but a series of the most severe and
   dreadful family distresses since that time have rendered me incapable of
   completing them.

   "Though an entire stranger to me (for I have not the least idea from whom
   the letter I am replying to came), I feel obliged to you for the liberal
   opinion therein expressed of me and of my fitness for the work.

   "I have taken great pains that the life of my friend should be given to
   the world as the subject merits; and a few weeks, whenever I can sit down
   to it, will complete it.

   "Unhappily, Cheetham is the real name of a real apostate. He lived, when
   Mr. Paine was my inmate in 1792, at Manchester, and was a violent and
   furious idolater of his.

   "That Mr. Paine died in the full conviction of the truth of the principles
   he held when living I shall fully prove, and should have answered the
   contemptible trash about his death, so industriously circulated, but that
   the whole account exhibited on the face of it fanatical fraud; and it was
   pushed forward in a mode and manner so ridiculous and glaringly absurd, as
   to carry with it its own antidote.

   "Such Christians would be much better employed in mending their own lives,
   and showing in them an example of good manners and morals, than in
   calumniating the characters and in detailing silly stories of the deaths
   of those Deists who have infinitely outstripped them, in their journey
   through life, in every talent and virtue, and in diffusing information and
   happiness among their fellowmen.

   "I again beg the favor of a call, as the circumstances attached to the
   query of yours, and the delays and hindrances, which are of a family and
   distressing nature, to the publication of Mr. Paine's life, are better
   adapted for private than for public discussion.

   "I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

   "Clio Rickman."

   It may not be necessary for me to promise anything further than to say,
   that I affect not to rank with literary men, nor, as they rise, do I wish
   it; that authorship is neither my profession nor pursuit; and that, except
   in an undeviating attention to truth, and a better acquaintance with Mr.
   Paine and his life than any other man, I am perhaps the most unfit to
   arrange it for the public eye.

   What I have hitherto written and published has arisen out of the moment,
   has been composed on the spur of the occasion, inspired by the scenery and
   circumstances around me, and produced abroad and at home, amid innumerable
   vicissitudes, the hurry of travel, business, pleasure, and during a life
   singularly active, eventful and checkered.

   Latterly, too, that life has been begloomed by a train of ills which have
   trodden on each other's heel, and which, added to the loss of my inspirer,
   my guide, my genius, and my muse; of her, the most highly qualified and
   best able to assist me, have rendered the work peculiarly irksome and
   oppressive.

   In the year 1802, on my journey from France, I had the misfortune to lose
   my desk of papers -- a loss I have never lamented more than on the present
   occasion. Among these were Mr. Paine's letters to me, particularly those
   from France in the most interesting years to Europe, 1792, 1793. Not a
   scrap of these, together with some of his poetry, could I ever recover. By
   this misfortune the reader will lose much entertaining and valuable
   matter.

   These memoirs [1819] have remained untouched from 1811 till now, and have
   not received any addition of biographical matter since. They were written
   by that part of my family who were at hand, as I dictated them; by those
   loved beings of whom death has deprived me, and from whom other severe
   ills have separated me. The manuscript, on these and many other accounts,
   awakens "busy meddling memory," and tortures me with painful remembrances;
   and save that it is a duty I owe to the public and to the memory and
   character of a valued friend, I should not have set about its arrangement.

   My heart is not in it. There are literary productions, which, like some
   children, though disagreeable to everybody else, are still favorites with
   the parent: this offspring of mine is not of this sort, it hath no such
   affection.

   Thus surrounded, and every way broken in upon by the most painful and
   harassing circumstances, I claim the reader's candor; and I now literally
   force myself to the publication of Mr. Paine's Life, lest it should again
   be improperly done, or not be done at all, and the knowledge of so great
   and good a man be thereby lost to the world.

   The engraving of Mr. Paine, prefixed to this work, is the only true
   likeness of him; it is from his portrait by Romney, and is perhaps the
   greatest likeness ever taken by any painter: to that eminent artist I
   introduced him in 1792, and it was by my earnest persuasion that he sat to
   him.

   Mr. Paine in his person was about five feet ten inches high; and rather
   athletic; he was broad-shouldered, and latterly stooped a little.

   His eye, of which the painter could not convey the exquisite meaning, was
   full, brilliant, and singularly piercing; it had in it the "muse of fire."
   In his dress and person he was generally very cleanly, and wore his hair
   cued, with side curls, and powdered, so that he looked altogether like a
   gentleman of the old French school.

   His manners were easy and gracious; his knowledge was universal and
   boundless; in private company and among friends his conversation had every
   fascination that anecdote, novelty and truth could give it. In mixed
   company and among strangers he said little, and was no public speaker.

   Thus much is said of him in general, and in this place, that the reader
   may the better bear us company in his Life.

   -----------------------------------------------------------

   Life of Thomas Paine
   by Thomas Clio Rickman
   [1819]

   The following memoirs of Mr. Paine, if they have no other merit, at least
   have that of being true.

   Europe and America have for years been in possession of his works: these
   form the most important part of his life, and these are publicly sold and
   generally read; nor will the spirit of inquiry and sound reasoning, which
   the publication of them is so well calculated to promote, be long confined
   to any part of the world; for, to use his own words, "An army of
   principles will penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot. It will
   succeed where diplomatic management would fail. It is neither the Rhine,
   the Channel, nor the Ocean, that can arrest its progress. It will march on
   the horizon of the world, and it will conquer."

   "What manner of man" Mr. Paine was, his works will best exhibit, and from
   these his public, and much of his private character, will be best
   ascertained. But, as solicitude about the life of a great man and an
   extraordinary writer is common to all, it is here attempted to be
   gratified.

   The Life of Mr. Paine by Francis Oldys was written seventeen years before
   Mr. Paine's death; and was in fact, drawn up by a person employed by a
   certain lord, and who was to have five hundred pounds for the job, if he
   calumniated and belied him to his lordship's and the Ministry's
   satisfaction.

   A continuation of this Life, printed at Philadelphia in 1796, is in the
   same strain as the above, and equally contemptible.

   A most vile and scandalous memoir of Paine, with the name of William
   Cobbett as the author, though we hope he was not so, appeared in London
   about the year 1795 with this motto:

   A life that's one continued scene                   
   Of all that's infamous and mean.                    


   Mr. James Cheetham's Life of Mr. Paine, published at New York after Mr.
   Paine's death in 1809, is a farrago of still more silly, trifling, false
   and malicious matter. It is an outrageous attack upon Paine which bears
   upon the face of it, idle gossiping and gross misrepresentation.

   The critique of this Life, in the British Review for June, 1811, consists
   of more corrupt trash about Mr. Paine than even Cheetham's book and is in
   its style inflated and bombastic to a laughable excess. Whence this came,
   and for what purpose published, the candid will readily discern and cannot
   but lament the too frequent abuse, both by the tongue and by the pen, of
   characters entirely unknown to those who libel them, and by whom, if they
   were known, they would be approved and esteemed.

   Indeed the whole of these works are so ridiculously overstrained in their
   abuse that they carry their own antidote with them.

   The Life by Cheetham is so palpably written to distort, disfigure,
   mislead, and vilify, and does this so bunglingly, that it defeats its own
   purposes, and becomes entertaining from the excess of its labored and
   studied defamation.

   It is indeed "guilt's blunder," and subverts all it was intended to
   accomplish. It is filled with long details of uninteresting American
   matter, bickering letters of obscure individuals, gossiping stories of
   vulgar fanatics, prejudiced political cant and weak observations on
   theology.

   It may be supposed, from my long and affectionate intercourse with Mr.
   Paine, that these memoirs will have an opposite bias, and portray a too
   flattering and exalted character of him.

   To this I reply, that I am not disposed to advocate the errors or
   irregularities of any man, however intimate with him, nor to suffer the
   partialities of friendship to prevent the due appreciation of character,
   or induce me to disregard the hallowed dictates of truth.

   Paine was of those --

   Who, wise by centuries before the crowd,            
   Must by their novel systems, though correct,    
   Of course offend the wicked, weak and proud --      
   Must meet with hatred, calumny, neglect.        

   In his retirement to America, toward the close of his life, Mr. Paine was
   particularly unfortunate; for, as the author of the "Age of Reason," he
   could not have gone to so unfavorable a quarter of the world.

   A country abounding in fanatics, could not be a proper one for him whose
   mind was bold, inquiring, liberal and soaring, free from prejudice, and
   who from the principle was a Deist.

   Of all wrath, fanatical wrath is the most intense, nor can it be a matter
   of surprise that Mr. Paine received from great numbers in America, an
   unwelcome reception, and was treated with neglect and illiberality.

   It is true on his return to that country in 1802, he received great
   attention from many of those who remembered the mighty influence of his
   writings in the gloomy period of the Revolution; and from others who had
   since embraced his principles; but these attentions were by many not long
   continued.

   Thousands, who had formerly looked up to Mr. Paine as the principal
   founder of the Republic, had imbibed a strong dislike to him on account of
   his religious principles; and thousands more, who were opposed to his
   political principles, seized hold of the mean and dastardly expedient of
   attacking those principles through the religious feelings and prejudices
   of the people. The vilest calumnies were constantly vented against him in
   the public papers, and the weak-minded were afraid to encounter the
   popular prejudice.

   The letter he wrote to General Washington also estranged him from many of
   his old friends, and has been to his adversaries a fruitful theme of
   virulent accusation, and a foundation on which to erect a charge of
   ingratitude and intemperance. It must certainly be confessed that his
   naturally warm feelings, which could ill brook any slight, particularly
   where he was conscious he so little deserved it, appear to have led him to
   form a somewhat precipitate judgment of the conduct of the American
   President, with regard to his (Mr. Paine's) imprisonment in France, and to
   attribute to design and wilful neglect what was probably only the result
   of inattention or perhaps of misinformation; and under the influence of
   this incorrect impression he seems to have indulged, rather too hastily,
   suspicions of Washington's political conduct with respect to England.

   But surely some little allowance should be made for the circumstances
   under which he wrote; just escaped from the horrors of a prison where he
   had been for several months confined under the sanguinary reign of
   Robespierre, when death strode incessantly through its cells, and the
   guillotine floated in the blood of its wretched inhabitants; and if, with
   the recollection of these scenes of terror fresh in his memory, and
   impressed with the idea that it was by Washington's neglect that his life
   had been thus endangered, he may have been betrayed into a style of
   severity which was perhaps not quite warranted, we can only lament,
   without attaching blame to either, that anything jarring should have
   occurred between two men who were both stanch supporters of the cause of
   freedom, and thus have given the enemies of liberty occasion to triumph
   because its advocates were not more than mortal.

   The dark and troublous years of the Revolution having passed away, and a
   government being firmly established, wealth possessed more influence than
   patriotism; and, a large portion of the people consisting of dissenters,
   fanaticism was more predominant than toleration, candor and charity.

   These causes produced the shameful and ungrateful neglect of Mr. Paine in
   the evening of his days, of that Paine who by his long, faithful, and
   disinterested services in the Revolution, and afterwards by inculcating
   and enforcing correct principles, deserved, above all other men, the most
   kind and unremitting attention from, and to be held in the highest
   estimation by, the American people.

   There were indeed a chosen and enlightened few, who, like himself "bold
   enough to be honest and honest enough to be bold," feeling his value,
   continued to be his friends to his last hour.

   Paine was not one of the great men who live amid great events, and forward
   and share their splendor; he created them; and, in this point of view, he
   was a very superior character to Washington.

   Mr. Paine having ever in his mind the services he had rendered the United
   States, of whose independence he was the principal author and means, it
   cannot be a matter of wonder that he was deeply hurt and affected at not
   being recognized and treated by the Americans as he deserved, and as his
   labors for their benefit merited.

   Shunned where he ought to have been caressed, coldly neglected where he
   ought to have been cherished, thrown into the background where he ought to
   have been prominent, and cruelly treated and calumniated by a host of
   ignorant and canting fanatics, it cannot be a subject of surprise, though
   it certainly must of regret, that he sometimes, toward the close of his
   life, fell into the too frequent indulgence of stimulants, neglected his
   appearance, and retired, mortified and disgusted, from an ill-judging,
   unkind, unjust world, into obscurity, and the association of characters in
   an inferior social position.

   In this place it is absolutely necessary to observe that during his
   residence with me in London, in and about the year 1792, and in the course
   of his life previous to that time, he was not in the habit of drinking to
   excess; he was clean in his person, and in his manners polite and
   engaging; and ten years after this, when I was with him in France, he did
   not drink spirits, and wine he took moderately; he even objected to any
   spirits being laid in as a part of his sea stock, observing to me, that
   though sometimes, borne down by public and private affliction, he had been
   driven to excesses in Paris, the cause and effect would cease together,
   and that in America he should live as he liked, and as he ought to live.

   That Mr. Paine had his failings is as true as that he was a man, and that
   some of them grew on him at a very advanced time of life, arising from the
   circumstances before detailed, there can be no doubt: but to magnify
   these, to give him vices he had not, and seek only occasions of
   misrepresenting and vilifying his character, without bringing forward the
   great and good traits in it, is cruel, unkind, and unjust.

   "Let those who stand take heed lest they fall." They too, when age
   debilitates the body and mind, and unexpected trials and grievances assail
   them, may fall into errors that they now vauntingly value themselves in
   not having. Singularly blest are they who are correct in their conduct;
   they should be happy and thankful that they are so; and instead of
   calumniating and being hard upon, should compassionate those who are not.

   The throwers of the first stone would indeed be few if the condition were
   complied with on which it should be cast. That Mr. Paine in his declining
   years became careless of his personal appearance, and maybe, somewhat
   parsimonious, is in some measure true; but, to these errors of his old
   age, we ought to oppose his being the principal agent in creating the
   government of the American States; and that through his efforts millions
   have now the happiness of sitting at ease under their own vines and their
   own fig trees; his fair and upright conduct through life, his honest
   perseverance in principles which he might have had immense sums for
   relinquishing, or for being silent about, his never writing for money or
   making his works matter of pecuniary advantage to himself, but, on the
   contrary, as will be exemplified in these memoirs, his firmness in
   resisting all such emolument and in not listening to the voice of the
   briber.

   Even amidst the violent party abuse of the day there were contemporary
   writers who knew how to appreciate Mr. Paine's talents and principles, and
   to speak of him as he deserved.*

   * Footnote:                                         
   There were also public meetings held, and addresses 
   to him from Nottingham, Norwich, etc., etc., from   
   the Constitutional Society in London, to which      
   belonged persons of great affluence and influence,  
   and some of the best informed, best intentioned,    
   and most exalted characters. From these and from    
   many other bodies of men were published the highest 
   testimonies of thanks and approbation of Mr. Paine  
   and his political works. These addresses and the    
   resolutions of the public meetings may be seen in   
   the papers and hand bills of the day.               
                                                       
   --------------------------------------------------- 

   "We are now," says one of these, "to treat of a real great man, a noble of
   nature, one whose mind is enlarged and wholly free from prejudice; one who
   has most usefully and honorably devoted his pen to support the glorious
   cause of general liberty and the rights of man. In his reply to Mr.
   Burke's miserable rhapsody in favor of oppression, popery, and tyranny, he
   has urged the most lucid arguments, and brought forward truths the most
   convincing. Like a powerful magician he touches with his wand the hills of
   error and they smoke; the mountains of inhumanity and they melt away."

   "Had Thomas Paine," says another most enlightened writer in 1795, in reply
   to Cheetham, Cobbett, Oldys, etc., "been nothing superior to a vagabond
   seaman, a bankrupt stay-maker, a discarded exciseman, a porter in the
   streets of Philadelphia, or whatever else the insanity of Grub Street
   chooses to call him, hundreds of thousands of copies of his writing had
   never announced his name in every village on the globe where the English
   language is spoken, and very extensively where it is not; nor would the
   rays of royal indignation have illuminated that character which they
   cannot scorch."

   Even Mr. Burke, writing on one of Mr. Paine's works, "Common Sense," says,
   "that celebrated pamphlet, which prepared the minds of the people for
   independence."

   It has been a fashion among the enemies of Mr. Paine, when unable to cope
   with his arguments, to attack his style, which they charge with inaccuracy
   and want of elegance; and some, even of those most friendly to his
   principles have joined in this captious criticism. It had not, perhaps,
   all the meretricious ornaments and studied graces that glitter in the
   pages of Burke, which would have been so many obscurities in the eyes of
   that part of the community for whose perusal his writings were principally
   intended, but it is singularly nervous and pointed; his arguments are
   always forcibly stated, nor does a languid line ever weary the attention
   of the reader. It is true, he never studied variety of phrase at the
   expense of perspicuity. His object was to enlighten, not to dazzle; and
   often, for the sake of more forcibly impressing an idea on the mind of the
   reader, he has made use of verbal repetitions which to a fastidious ear
   may perhaps sound unmusical. But although, in the opinion of some, his
   pages may be deficient in elegance, few will deny that they are copious in
   matter; and, if they sometimes fail to tickle the ear, they will never
   fail to fill the mind.

   Distinctness and arrangement are the peculiar characteristics of his
   writings: this reflection brings to mind an observation once made to him
   by an American girl, "that his head was like an orange -- it had a
   separate apartment for everything it contained."

   Notwithstanding this general character of his writings, the bold and
   original style of thinking which everywhere pervades them often displays
   itself in a luxuriance of imagery, and a poetic elevation of fancy, which
   stand unrivaled in the pages of our English classics.

   Thomas Paine was born at Thetford in the County of Norfolk in England, on
   the twenty-ninth of January, 1736. His father, Joseph Paine, who was the
   son of a reputable farmer, followed the trade of a stay-maker, and was by
   religious profession a Quaker. His mother's maiden name was Frances Cocke,
   a member of the Church of England, and daughter of an attorney at
   Thetford.

   They were married at the parish church of Euston, near Thetford, the
   twentieth of June, 1734.

   His father, by this marriage out of the Society of Quakers, was disowned
   by that community.

   Mr. Paine received his education at the grammar school at Thetford, under
   the Rev. William Knowles, master; and one of his schoolmates at that time
   was the late Counsellor Mingay.

   He gave very early indication of talents and strong abilities, and
   addicted himself when a mere boy, to reading poetical authors; but this
   disposition his parents endeavored to discourage.

   When a child he composed some lines on a fly being caught in a spider's
   web, and produced when eight years of age, the following epitaph on a crow
   which he buried in the garden:

   Here lies the body of John Crow,                    
   Who once was high but now is low:                   
   Ye brother Crows take warning all,                  
   For as you rise, so must you fall.                  


   At this school his studies were directed merely to the useful branches of
   reading, writing, and arithmetic, and he left it at thirteen years of age,
   applying, though he did not like it, to his father's business for nearly
   five years.

   In the year 1756, when about twenty years of age, he went to London, where
   he worked some time in Hanover Street, Long Acre, with Mr. Morris, a noted
   stay-maker.

   He continued but a short time in London, and it is probable about this
   time made his seafaring adventure of which he thus speaks: "At an early
   age, raw and adventurous, and heated with the false heroism of a master
   [Rev. Mr. Knowles, master of the grammar school at Thetford] who had
   served in a man-of-war, I began my fortune, and entered on board the
   Terrible, Captain Death. From this adventure I was happily prevented by
   the affectionate and moral remonstrances of a good father, who from the
   habits of his life, being of the Quaker profession, looked on me as lost;
   but the impression, much as it affected me at the time, wore away, and I
   entered afterwards in the King of Prussia privateer, Captain Mendez, and
   went with her to sea."

   This way of life Mr. Paine soon left, and about the year 1758, worked at
   his trade for near twelve months at Dover. In April, 1759, he settled as a
   master stay-maker at Sandwich, and the twenty-seventh of September
   following married Mary Lambert, the daughter of an exciseman of that place
   In April, 1760, he removed with his wife to Margate, where she died
   shortly after, and he again mingled with the crowds of London.

   In July, 1761, disgusted with the toil and little gain of his late
   occupation, he renounced it for ever, and determined to apply himself to
   the profession of an exciseman, toward which, as his wife's father was of
   that calling, he had some time turned his thoughts.

   At this period he sought shelter under his father's roof at Thetford, that
   he might prosecute, in quiet and retirement, the object of his future
   course. Through the interest of Mr. Cocksedge, the recorder of Thetford,
   after fourteen months of study, he was established as a supernumerary in
   the excise, at the age of twenty-five.

   In this situation at Grantham and Alford, etc., he did not continue more
   than two or three years, when he relinquished it in August, 1765, and
   commenced it again in July, 1766.

   In this interval he was teacher at Mr. Noble's academy in Leman Street,
   Goodman's Fields, at a salary of twenty-five pounds a year. In a similar
   occupation he afterwards lived for a short time, at Kensington, with a Mr.
   Gardner.

   I remember when once speaking of the improvement he gained in the above
   capacities and some other lowly situations he had been in, he made this
   observation. "Here I derived considerable information; indeed I have
   seldom passed five minutes of my life, however circumstanced, in which I
   did not acquire some knowledge."

   During this residence in London, Mr. Paine attended the philosophical
   lectures of Martin and Ferguson, and became acquainted with Dr. Bevis of
   the Temple, a great astronomer. In these studies and in the mathematics he
   soon became a proficient.

   In March, 1768, he was settled as an exciseman at Lewes, in Sussex, and
   there, on the twenty-sixth of March, 1771, married Elizabeth Olive,
   shortly after the death of her father, whose trade of a tobacconist he
   entered into and carried on.

   In this place he lived several years in habits of intimacy with a very
   respectable, sensible, and convivial set of acquaintance, who were
   entertained with his witty sallies, and informed by his more serious
   conversations.

   In politics he was at this time a Whig, and notorious for that quality
   which has been defined perseverance in a good cause and obstinacy in a bad
   one. He was tenacious of his opinions, which were bold, acute, and
   independent, and which he maintained with ardor, elegance, and argument.

   At this period, at Lewes, the White Hart Evening Club was the resort of a
   social and intelligent circle who, out of fun, seeing that disputes often
   ran very warm and high, frequently had what they called the "Headstrong
   Book." This was no other than an old Greek Homer which was sent the
   morning after a debate vehemently maintained, to the most obstinate
   haranguer of the club: this book had the following title, as implying that
   Mr. Paine the best deserved and most frequently obtained it.

                                Eulogy on Paine.
                  Immortal Paine, while mighty reasoners jar,
                  We crown thee General of the Headstrong War;
                     Thy logic vanish'd error, and thy mind
               No bounds, but those of right and truth, confined.
                   Thy soul of fire must sure ascend the sky,
                    Immortal Paine, thy fame can never die;
                  For men like thee their names must ever save
                   From the black edicts of the tyrant grave.

   My friend Mr. Lee, of Lewes, in communicating this to me in September,
   1810, said: "This was manufactured nearly forty years ago, as applicable
   to Mr. Paine, and I believe you will allow, however indifferent the
   manner, that I did not very erroneously anticipate his future celebrity."

   During his residence at Lewes, he wrote several excellent little pieces in
   prose and verse, and among the rest the celebrated song on the death of
   General Wolfe, beginning

   "In a mouldering cave where the wretched retreat.""    

   It was about this time he wrote " The Trial of Farmer Carter's Dog
   Porter," in the manner of a drama, a work of exquisite wit and humor.

   In 1772 the excise officers throughout the kingdom formed a design of
   applying to Parliament for some addition to their salaries. Upon this
   occasion Mr. Paine, who, by this time, was distinguished among them as a
   man of talent, was fixed upon as a fit person, and solicited to draw up
   their case, and this he did in a very succinct and masterly manner. This
   case makes an octavo pamphlet, and four thousand copies were printed by
   Mr. William Lee, of Lewes. It is entitled "The Case of the Salary of the
   Officers of Excise, and Thoughts on the Corruption Arising from the
   Poverty of Excise Officers." No application, however, notwithstanding this
   effort, was made to Parliament.

   In April, 1774, the goods of his shop were sold to pay his debts. As a
   grocer, he trafficked in excisable articles, and being suspected of unfair
   practices, was dismissed the excise after being in it twelve years.
   Whether this reason was a just one or not never was ascertained; it was,
   however, the ostensible one. Mr. Paine might perhaps have been in the
   habit of smuggling, in common with his neighbors. It was the universal
   custom along the coast, and more or less the practise of all ranks of
   people, from lords and ladies, ministers and magistrates, down to the
   cottager and laborer.

   As Mr. Paine's being dismissed the excise has been a favorite theme with
   his abusers it may be necessary here to relate the following fact:

   At the time he was an exciseman at Lewes, he was so approved for doing his
   duty that Mr. Jenner, principal clerk in the excise office, London, had
   several times occasion to write letters from the Board of Excise, thanking
   Mr. Paine for his assiduity in his profession, and for his information and
   calculations forwarded to the office.

   In May following Mr. Paine and his wife separated by mutual agreement,
   articles of which were finally settled on the fourth of June. Which of
   them was in this instance wrong, or whether either of them was so, must be
   left undetermined, as on this subject no knowledge or judgment can be
   formed. They are now both removed, where, as we are told, none "are either
   married or given in marriage," and where, consequently, there can be no
   disagreements on this score. This I can assert, that Mr. Paine always
   spoke tenderly and respectfully of his wife, and several times sent her
   pecuniary aid, without her knowing even whence it came.

   Toward the end of the year 1774, he was strongly recommended to the great
   and good Dr. Franklin, "the favor of whose friendship," he says, "I
   possessed in England and my introduction to this part of the world
   [America] was through his patronage."*

   --------------------------------------------------- 
                                                       
   * Footnote:

   --------------------------------------------------- 

   Mr. Paine now formed the resolution of quitting his native country, and
   soon crossed the Atlantic; and, as he himself relates, arrived in
   Philadelphia in the winter, a few months before the battle of Lexington,
   which was fought in April, 1775.

   It appears that his first employment in the new world was with Mr. Aitken,
   a book-seller, as editor of the Pennsylvanian Magazine; and his
   introduction to that work, dated January 24, 1775, is thus concluded:
   "Thus encompassed with difficulties, this first number of the
   Pennsylvanian Magazine entreats a favorable reception, of which we shall
   only say, that like the early snow-drop it comes forth in a barren season,
   and contents itself with foretelling the reader that choicer flowers are
   preparing to appear."

   Soon after his return [sic] to America, as foreign supplies of gunpowder
   were stopped, he turned his attention to chemistry, and set his fertile
   talents to work in endeavoring to discover some cheap and expeditious
   method of furnishing Congress with saltpeter, and he proposed, in the
   Pennsylvanian Journal, November 2, 1775, the plan of a saltpeter
   association for voluntarily supplying the national magazines with
   gunpowder.

   His popularity in America now increased daily, and from this era he became
   a great public character and an object of interest and attention in the
   world. In 1776, on the tenth of January, he published the celebrated and
   powerfully discriminating pamphlet, "Common Sense." Perhaps the greatest
   compliment that can be paid to this work is the effect it so rapidly had
   on the people, who had before no predisposition toward its principles.

   Even Mr. Cheetham, whom no one will suspect of flattering Mr. Paine, thus
   forcibly describes the effects of "Common Sense" on the people of America:

   "This pamphlet of forty octavo pages, holding out relief by proposing
   independence to an oppressed and despairing people, was published in
   January, 1776, speaking a language which the colonists had felt, but not
   thought of. Its popularity, terrible in its consequences to the parent
   country, was unexampled in the history of the press. At first involving
   the colonists, it was thought, in the crime of rebellion, and pointing to
   a road leading inevitably to ruin, it was read with indignation and alarm,
   but when the reader, (and everybody read it), recovering from the first
   shock, re-perused it, its arguments nourishing his feelings, and appealing
   to his pride, reanimated his hopes and satisfied his understanding, that
   'Common Sense,' backed up by the resources and force of the colonies, poor
   and feeble as they were, could alone rescue them from the unqualified
   oppression with which they were threatened. The unknown author, in the
   moments of enthusiasm which succeeded, was an angel sent from heaven to
   save from all the horrors of slavery by his timely, powerful and unerring
   councils, a faithful but abused, a brave but misrepresented people."

   "Common Sense," it appears, was universally read and approved; the first
   edition sold almost immediately, and the second with very large additions
   was before the public soon after.

   Owing to this disinterested conduct of Mr. Paine, it appears that though
   the sale of "Common Sense" was so great, he was in debt to the printer
   -L-29 12s 1d. This liberality and conscientious discharge of his duty with
   respect to his serviceable writings, as he called them, he adopted through
   life. "When I bring out my poetical and anecdotical works," he would often
   say to me, "which will be little better than amusing, I shall sell them;
   but I must have no gain in view, must make no traffic of my political and
   theological writings. They are with me a matter of principle and not a
   matter of money; I cannot desire to derive benefit from them or make them
   the subject to attain it."

   In the course of this year, 1776, Mr. Paine accompanied the army with
   General Washington, and was with him in his retreat from the Hudson River
   to the Delaware. At this period our author stood undismayed, amid a flying
   Congress, and the general terror of the land. The Americans, he loudly
   asserted, were in possession of resources sufficient to authorize hope,
   and he labored to inspire others with the same sentiments which animated
   himself. To effect this, on the nineteenth of December he published "The
   Crisis," wherein, with a masterly hand, he stated every reason for hope,
   and examined all the motives for apprehension. This work he continued at
   various intervals, till the Revolution was established. The last number
   appeared on the nineteenth of April, 1783, the same day a cessation of
   hostilities was proclaimed.

   In 1777, Congress unanimously, and unknown to Mr. Paine, appointed him
   Secretary in the Foreign Department, and from this time a close friendship
   continued between him and Dr. Franklin. From his office went all letters
   that were officially written by Congress, and the correspondence of
   Congress rested afterwards in his hands. This appointment gave Mr. Paine
   an opportunity of seeing into foreign courts, and their manner of doing
   business and conducting themselves. In this office, which obliged him to
   reside with Congress wherever it fled, or however it was situated, Mr.
   Paine deserved the highest praise for the clearness, firmness and
   magnanimity of his conduct. His uprightness and entire fitness for this
   office did not, however, prevent intrigue and interestedness, or defeat
   cabal; for a difference being fomented between Congress and him,
   respecting one of their commissioners then in Europe (Mr. Silas Deane), he
   resigned his secretaryship on the eighth of January, 1779, and declined,
   at the same time, the pecuniary offers made him by the ministers of France
   and Spain, M. Gerard and Don Juan Mirralles.

   This resignation of, or dismissal from his situation as Secretary for
   Foreign Affairs, has been so variously mentioned and argued upon, that the
   reader is referred to the tedious detail of it in the journals of the day,
   if he has patience to wade through so much American temporary and party
   political gossip. Mr. Paine's own account in his letter to Congress
   shortly is, "I prevented Deane's fraudulent demand being paid, and so far
   the country is obliged to me, but I became the victim of my integrity."

   The party junto against him say he was guilty of a violation of his
   official duty, etc.

   And here I shall leave it, as the bickerings of parties in America, in the
   year 1779, cannot be worth a European's attention; and as to the Americans
   themselves they have various means, by their legislatural records,
   registers of the day, and pamphlets, then and since, to go into the
   subject if they think it of importance enough.

   About this time Mr. Paine had the degree of Master of Arts conferred on
   him by the University of Philadelphia, and in 1780 was chosen a member of
   the American Philosophical Society, when it was revived by the Legislature
   of the Province of Pennsylvania.

   In February, 1781, Colonel Laurens, amidst the financial distress of
   America, was sent on mission to France in order to obtain a loan, and Mr.
   Paine, at the solicitation of the Colonel, accompanied him.

   Mr. Paine, in his letter to Congress, intimates that this mission
   originated with himself, and takes upon himself the credit of it.

   They arrived in France the following month, obtained a loan of ten
   millions of livres and a present of six millions, and landed in America
   the succeeding August with two millions and a half in silver. His value,
   his firmness, his independence, as a political character, were now
   universally acknowledged; his great talents, and the high purposes to
   which he devoted them, made him generally sought after and looked up to,
   and General Washington was foremost to express the great sense he had of
   the excellence of his character and the importance of his services, and
   would himself have proposed to Congress a great remuneration of them, had
   not Mr. Paine positively objected to it as a bad precedent and an improper
   mode.

   In August, 1782, he published his spirited letter to the Abbe Raynal; of
   this letter a very sensible writer observes, "that it displays an accuracy
   of judgment and strength of penetration that would do honor to the most
   enlightened philosopher. It exhibits proofs of knowledge so comprehensive,
   and discrimination so acute, as must in the opinion of the best judges
   place the author in the highest ranks of literature."

   On the twenty-ninth of October he brought out his excellent letter to the
   Earl of Shelburne, on his speech in the House of Lords, July 10, 1782.

   To get an idea of the speech of this Earl it may not be necessary to quote
   more than the following sentence: "When Great Britain acknowledges
   American independence the sun of Britain's glory is set forever."

   "When the war ended," says Mr. Paine, "I went from Philadelphia to Borden
   Town on the East end of the Delaware, where I have a small place. Congress
   was at this time at Prince Town, fifteen miles distant, and General
   Washington had taken his headquarters at Rocky Hill, within the
   neighborhood of Congress, for the purpose of resigning his commission, the
   object for which he had accepted it being accomplished, and of retiring to
   private life. While he was on this business he wrote me the letter which I
   here subjoin:"

   "Rocky Hill, September 10,1783.

   "I have learned since I have been at this place that you are at Borden
   Town. Whether for the sake of retirement or economy I know not; be it for
   either, for both, or whatever it may, if you will come to this place and
   partake with me, I shall be exceedingly happy to see you at it. Your
   presence may remind Congress of your past services to this country, and if
   it is in my power to impress them, command my best services with freedom;
   as they will be rendered cheerfully by one who entertains a lively sense
   of the importance of your works, and who with much pleasure, subscribes
   himself,

   "Your sincere friend,
   G. Washington.

   In 1785, Congress granted Mr. Paine three thousand dollars for his
   services to the people of America, as may be seen by the following
   document:

   "Friday, August 26, 1785.

   "On the report of a committee consisting of Mr. Gerry, Mr. Petet and Mr.
   King, to whom was referred a letter of the thirteenth from Thomas Paine,

   "Resolved, That the early, unsolicited, and continued labors of Mr. Thomas
   Paine, in explaining the principles of the late Revolution, by ingenious
   and timely publications upon the nature of liberty and civil government,
   have been well received by the citizens of these states, and merit the
   approbation of Congress; and that in consideration of these services, and
   the benefits produced thereby, Mr. Paine is entitled to a liberal
   gratification from the United States."

   "Monday, October 3, 1785.

   "On a report of a committee consisting of Mr. Gerry, Mr. Howell and Mr.
   Long, to whom were referred sundry letters from Mr. Thomas Paine, and a
   report on his letter of the fourteenth of September,

   "Resolved, That the Board of Treasury take order for paying to Mr. Thomas
   Paine, the sum of three thousand dollars, for the considerations of the
   twenty-third of August last." -- Journals of Congress.

   The State of Pennsylvania, in which he first published "Common Sense" and
   the "Crisis," in 1785, presented him, by an act of Legislature, five
   hundred pounds currency. New York gave him the estate at New Rochelle, in
   the county of Westchester, consisting of more than three hundred acres of
   land in high cultivation. On this estate was an elegant stone house, 125
   by 28 feet, besides outhouses; the latter property was farmed much to his
   advantage, during his long stay in Europe, by some friends, as will
   hereafter be more fully noticed.

   Mr. Monroe, when Ambassador in England, once speaking on this subject at
   my house, said that Mr. Paine would have received a very large
   remuneration from the State of Virginia, but that while the matter was
   before the Assembly, and he was extremely popular and in high favor, he
   published reasons against some proceedings of that State which he thought
   improper, and thereby lost, by a majority of one, the high reward he would
   otherwise have received;* -- a memorable instance of the independence of
   his mind, and of his attachment to truth and right above all other
   considerations. A conduct exactly opposite to that of the pensioned Burke,
   whose venality cannot be better pointed out than in the following
   conversation with Mr. Paine, after dining together at the Duke of
   Portland's at Bulstrode.

   ---------------------------------------------------

   This work was entitled "Public Good, being an       
   Examination of the Claim of Virginia to Vacant      
   Western Territory."                                 
                                                       
   --------------------------------------------------- 

   Burke was very inquisitive to know how the Americans were disposed toward
   the King of England, when Mr. Paine, to whom the subject was an ungracious
   one, and who felt teased, related the following anecdote:

   At a small town, in which was a tavern bearing the sign of the King's
   head, it was insisted on by the inhabitants that a memento so odious
   should not continue up, but there was no painter at hand to change it into
   General Washington, or any other favorite, so the sign was suffered to
   remain, with this inscription under it:

   This is the sign of the Loggerhead!                 


   Burke, who at this moment was a concealed pensioner, though a public
   oppositionist, replied, peevishly: "Loggerhead or any other head, he has
   many good things to give away, and I should be glad of some of them."

   This same Mr. Burke, in one of his speeches in the House of Commons, said,
   "kings were naturally fond of low company," and "that many of the nobility
   act the part of flatterers, parasites, pimps and buffoons, etc.," but his
   character will be best appreciated by reading Mr. Paine's "Letter to the
   Addressers."

   In 1786 he published in Philadelphia "Dissertation on Government, the
   Affairs of the Bank, and Paper Money," an octavo pamphlet of sixty-four
   pages. The bank alluded to is the Bank of North America, of which he thus
   speaks:

   "In the year 1780, when the British Army, having laid waste the Southem
   States, closed its ravages by the capture of Charleston, when the
   financial sources of Congress were dried up, when the public treasury was
   empty, and the army of independence paralyzed by want, a voluntary
   subscription for its relief was raised in Philadelphia." This voluntary
   fund, amounting to three hundred thousand pounds, afterwards converted
   into a bank by the subscribers, headed by Robert Morris, supplied the
   wants of the army; probably the aids which it furnished enabled Washington
   to carry into execution his well-concerted plan against Cornwallis.
   Congress, in the year 1781, incorporated the subscribers to the fund,
   under the title of the Bank of North America. In the following year it was
   further incorporated by an Act of the Pennsylvanian Assembly. Mr. Paine
   liberally subscribed five hundred dollars to this fund.

   After the establishment of the independence of America, of the vigorous
   and successful exertions to attain which glorious object he had been the
   animating principle, soul and support; feeling his exertions no longer
   requisite in that country, he embarked for France, and arrived in Paris
   early in 1787, carrying with him his fame as a literary man, an acute
   philosopher, and most profound politician.

   At this time he presented to the Academy of Science the model of a bridge
   which he invented, the principle of which has been since so highly
   celebrated and approved.

   From Paris he arrived in England the third of September, just thirteen
   years after his departure for Philadelphia. Prompted by that filial
   affection which his conduct had ever manifested, he hastened to Thetford
   to visit his mother, on whom he settled an allowance of nine shillings a
   week. Of this comfortable solace she was afterwards deprived by the
   bankruptcy of the merchant in whom the trust was vested.

   Mr. Paine resided at Rotherham in Yorkshire during part of the year 1788,
   where an iron bridge upon the principle alluded to was cast and erected,
   and obtained for him among the mathematicians of Europe a high reputation.
   In the erection of this, a considerable sum had been expended, for which
   he was hastily arrested by the assignees of an American merchant, and
   thrown into confinement. From this, however, and the debt, he cleared
   himself in about three weeks.*

   More or less upon this plan of Mr. Paine's, the     
   different iron bridges in Europe have been          
   constructed.                                        
                                                       
   --------------------------------------------------- 

   The publication of Mr. Burke's "Reflections on the French Revolution,"
   produced in reply from Mr. Paine his great, universally known, and
   celebrated work, "Rights of Man." The first part of this work was written
   partly at the Angel, of Islington, partly in Harding Street, Fetter Lane,
   and finished at Versailles. In February, 1791, this book made its
   appearance in London, and many hundred thousand copies were rapidly sold.
   In May following he went again to France and was at Paris at the time of
   the flight of the King, and also on his return. On this memorable occasion
   he made this observation: "You see the absurdity of your system of
   government; here will be a whole nation disturbed by the folly of one
   man." Upon this subject also he made the following reply to the Marquis
   Lafayette, who came into his bedroom before he was up, saying, "The birds
   are flown." "'Tis well, I hope there will be no attempt to recall them."

   On the thirteenth of July he returned to London, but did not attend the
   celebration of the anniversary of the French Revolution the following day,
   as has been falsely asserted.

   On the twentieth of August he drew up the address and declaration of the
   gentlemen who met at the Thatched House Tavern.

   The language of this address is bold and free, but not more so than that
   of the late Lord Chatham, or of that once violent advocate of reform, the
   late Mr. Pitt, better known by the title of the "Enemy of the Human Race."

   On the subject of the address at the Thatched House Tavern, which Mr.
   Paine did write, it is impossible not to quote Cheetham's "Life," just to
   exhibit his blindness and ignorance, and to show how prejudice had warped
   this once idolizer of Mr. Paine: "Home Tooke, perhaps the most acute man
   of his age, was at this meeting; and as it was rumored, Paine observes,
   that the great grammarian was the author of the address, he takes the
   liberty of mentioning the fact, that he wrote it himself. I never heard of
   the rumor, which was doubtless a fiction formed and asserted by Paine
   merely to gratify his egotism. No one could mistake the uncouth and
   ungrammatical writings of one, for the correct and elegant productions of
   the other." But what can be expected from him who calls "Common Sense" a
   wretched work; the "Rights of Man" a miserable production, and "Burke's
   Reflections" a book of the proudest sagacity?

   What can be expected from him who a few years before writing the above, in
   England deified Mr. Paine, and called his writings immortal?

                              Thomas Clio Rickman
                                      1819

   Mr. Paine's life in London was a quiet round of philosophical leisure and
   enjoyment. It was occupied in writing, in a small epistolary
   correspondence, in walking about with me to visit different friends,
   occasionally lounging at coffee-houses and public places, or being visited
   by a select few. Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the French and American
   ambassadors, Mr. Sharp the engraver, Romney the painter, Mrs. Mrs.
   Wollstonecraft, Joel Barlow, Mr. Hull, Mr. Christie, Dr. Priestley, Dr.
   Towers, Colonel Oswald, the walking Stewart, Captain Sampson Perry, Mr.
   Tuffin, Mr. William Choppin, Captain De Stark, Mr. Horne Tooke, etc.,
   etc., were among the number of his friends and acquaintance, and of
   course, as he was my inmate, the most of my associates were frequently
   his.

   At this time he read but little, took his nap after dinner, and played
   with my family at some game in the evening, as chess, dominos, and drafts,
   but never at cards; in recitations, singing, music, etc., or passed it in
   conversation; the part he took in the latter was always enlightened, full
   of information, entertainment and anecdote. Occasionally we visited
   enlightened friends, indulged in domestic jaunts, and recreations from
   home, frequently lounging at the White Bear, Piccadilly, with his old
   friend, the walking Stewart, and other clever travelers from France, and
   different parts of Europe and America.

   When by ourselves we sat very late, and often broke in on the morning
   hours, indulging the reciprocal interchange of affectionate and
   confidential intercourse. "Warm from the heart and faithful to its fires,"
   was that intercourse, and gave to us the "feast of reason and the flow of
   soul."

   The second part of "Rights of Man," which completed the celebrity of its
   author, and placed him at the head of political writers, was published in
   February, 1792. Never had any work so rapid and extensive a sale; and it
   has been calculated that near a million and a half of copies were printed
   and published in England.

   From this time Mr. Paine generally resided in London, and principally with
   me, till the twelfth of September, 1792, when he sailed for France with
   Mr. Achilles Audibert, who came express from the French Convention to my
   house to request his personal assistance in their deliberations.

   On his arrival at Calais a public dinner was provided, a royal salute was
   fired from the battery, the troops were drawn out, and there was a general
   rejoicing throughout the town. He has often been heard to remark that the
   proudest moment of his life was that in which, on this occasion, he set
   foot upon the Gallic shore.

   In his own country he had been infamously treated, and at the time of his
   quitting Dover most rudely dealt with both by the officers who ransacked
   his trunks, and a set of hirelings who were employed to hiss, hoot and
   maltreat, and it is strongly suspected, to destroy him.

   It depressed him to think that his endeavors to cleanse the Augaean stable
   of corruption in England should have been so little understood, or so ill
   appreciated as to subject him to such ignominious, such cowardly
   treatment. Yet seven hours after this, those very endeavors obtained him
   an honorable reception in France, and on his landing he was respectfully
   escorted, amidst the loud plaudits of the multitude, to the house of his
   friend, Mr. Audibert, the chief magistrate of the place, where he was
   visited by the commandant and all the municipal officers in form, who
   afterwards gave him a sumptuous entertainment in the town hall.

   The same honor was also paid him on his departure for Paris.*

   * Footnote:                                       
   The reader is referred to Brissot's paper, Le     
   Patriot Franc,ois, and Le Journal de Gorsas, for  
   minute particulars of Mr. Paine's introduction to 
   the president of the Convention, to the ministers 
   and different committees; his being appointed a   
   deputy, a member of the committee of              
   constitution, etc., etc., etc.                    

   About the time of his arrival at Paris the National Convention began to
   divide itself into factions; the King's friends had been completely
   subdued by the suppression of the Feuillans, the affair of the tenth of
   August, and the massacre of the second and third of September; while the
   Jacobins, who had been hitherto considered as the patriotic party, became
   in their turns divided into different cabals, some of them wishing a
   federative government, others, the enrages, desiring the death of the
   King, and of all allied to the nobility; but none of those were
   republicans.

   Those few deputies who had just ideas of a commonwealth, and whose leader
   was Paine, did not belong to the Jacobin Club.

   I mention this, because Mr. Paine took infinite trouble to instil into
   their minds the difference between liberty and licentiousness, and the
   danger to the peace, good order, and welldoing of society, that must arise
   from letting the latter encroach upon the prerogatives of the former.

   He labored incessantly to preserve the life of the King, and he succeeded
   in making some converts to his opinions on this subject; and his life
   would have been saved but for Barrere, who, having been appointed by
   Robespierre to an office he was ambitious of obtaining, and certainly very
   fit for, his influence brought with it forty votes; so early was
   corruption introduced into this assembly. For Calais, Mr. Paine was
   returned deputy to the Convention; he was elected as well for Versailles,
   but as the former town first did him the honor he became its
   representative. He was extremely desirous and expected to be appointed one
   of the deputies to Holland; a circumstance that probably would have taken
   place had not the Committee of Constitution delayed so long the production
   of the new form that the Jacobins anticipated them, and published
   proposals for a new constitution before the committee.

   This delay was owing to the jealousy of Condorcet, who had written the
   preface, part of which some of the members thought should have been in the
   body of the work. Brissot and the whole party of the Girondites lost
   ground daily after this; and with them died away all that was national,
   just and humane: they were, however, highly to blame for their want of
   energy.

   In the beginning of April, 1793, the Convention received the letter from
   Dumourier that put all France in a panic: in this letter he mentioned the
   confidence the army had in him, and his intention of marching to Paris to
   restore to France her constitutional King: this had the strongest effect,
   as it was accompanied by an address from the Prince of Coburg, in which he
   agreed to co-operate with Dumourier.

   Mr. Paine, who never considered the vast difference between the
   circumstances of the two countries, France and America, suggested an idea
   that Dumourier might be brought about by appointing certain deputies to
   wait on him coolly and dispassionately, to hear his grievances, and armed
   with powers to redress them.

   On this subject he addressed a letter to the Convention, in which he
   instanced the case of an American general who receded with the army under
   his command in consequence of his being dissatisfied with the proceedings
   of Congress. The Congress were panic-struck by this event, and gave up all
   for lost; and when the first impression of alarm subsided they sent a
   deputation from their own body to the general, who with his staff gave
   them the meeting; and thus matters were again reinstated. But there was
   too much impetuosity and faction in the French Convention to admit of such
   temperate proceedings.

   Mr. Paine, however, had written the letter, and was going to Brissot's in
   order to meet Barrere for the purpose of proposing an adjustment, when he
   met a friend who had that moment left the Convention, who informed him
   that a decree had been passed offering one hundred thousand crowns for
   Dumourier's head, and another making it high treason to propose anything
   in his favor.

   What the consequence of Mr. Paine's project might have been I do not know,
   but the offer of the Convention made hundreds of desperate characters
   leave Paris as speedily as possible, in hopes of the proffered reward; it
   detached the affection of the soldiers from their general, and made them
   go over to the enemy.

   Toward the close of 1792 his "Letter to the Addressers" was published,
   which was sought after with the same avidity as his other productions.

   Of this letter, which, with many other things, he wrote at my house, I
   have the original manuscript, and the table on which they were written is
   still carefully preserved by me. It has a brass plate in the center with
   this inscription, placed there by my direction on his quitting England:

                            "This Plate is inscribed
                            by Thomas Clio Rickman,
                       in remembrance of his dear friend,
                                 Thomas Paine,
                      who on this Table in the Year 1792,
                        wrote several of his invaluable
                                    Works."

   The "Letter to the Addressers" possesses all Mr. Paine's usual strength of
   reasoning, and abounds also in the finest strokes of genuine satire, wit
   and humor. About this time a prosecution took place against the publishers
   of "Rights of Man."

   As the Proclamation which gave rise to the "Letter to the Addressers" is a
   curious document, and evinces the temper of the powers that were of that
   day, it is for the entertainment of the reader here inserted:

   "The London Gazette, published by authority, from Saturday, May
   nineteenth, to Tuesday, May twenty-second.

   "By the King, a Proclamation.

   "George R.

   "Whereas, Divers wicked and seditious writings have been printed,
   published, and industriously dispersed, tending to excite tumult and
   disorder, by endeavoring to raise groundless jealousies and discontents in
   the minds of our faithful and loving subjects respecting the laws and
   happy constitution of government, civil and religious, established in this
   kingdom, and endeavoring to vilify, and bring into contempt, the wise and
   wholesome provisions made at the time of the glorious Revolution, and
   since strengthened and confirmed by subsequent laws for the preservation
   and security of the rights and liberties of our faithful and loving
   subjects: and whereas divers writings have also been printed, published,
   and industriously dispersed, recommending the said wicked and seditious
   publications to the attention of all our faithful and loving subjects:

   "And whereas we have also reason to believe that correspondencies have
   been entered into with sundry persons in foreign parts with a view to
   forward the criminal and wicked purposes above mentioned: and whereas the
   wealth, happiness and prosperity of this kingdom do, under Divine
   Providence, chiefly depend upon a due submission to the laws, a just
   confidence in the integrity and wisdom of Parliament, and a continuance of
   that zealous attachment to that government and constitution of the kingdom
   which has ever prevailed in the minds of the people thereof: and whereas
   there is nothing which we so earnestly desire as to secure the public
   peace and prosperity, and to preserve to all our loving subjects the full
   enjoyment of their rights and liberties, both religious and civil:

   "We, therefore, being resolved, as far as in us lies, to repress the
   wicked and seditious practices aforesaid, and to deter all persons from
   following so pernicious an example, have thought fit, by the advice of our
   Privy Council, to issue this our Royal Proclamation, solemnly warning all
   our loving subjects, as they tender their own happiness, and that of their
   posterity, to guard against all such attempts, which aim at the subversion
   of all regular government within this kingdom, and which are inconsistent
   with the peace and order of society: and earnestly exhorting them at all
   times, and to the utmost of their power, to avoid and discourage all
   proceedings, tending to produce tumults and riots: and we do strictly
   charge and command all our magistrates in and throughout our kingdom of
   Great Britain, that they do make diligent inquiry, in order to discover
   the authors and printers of such wicked and seditious writings as
   aforesaid, and all others who shall disperse the same: and we do further
   charge and command all our sheriffs, justices of the peace, chief
   magistrates in our cities, boroughs and corporations, and all other our
   officers and magistrates throughout our kingdom of Great Britain.

   "That they do, in their several and respective stations, take the most
   immediate and effectual care to suppress and prevent all riots, tumults
   and other disorders, which may be attempted to be raised or made by any
   person or persons, which, on whatever pretext they may be grounded, are
   not only contrary to law, but dangerous to the most important interests of
   this kingdom: and we do further require and command all and every our
   magistrates aforesaid that they do from time to time transmit to one of
   our principal secretaries of state due and full information of such
   persons as shall be found offending as aforesaid, or in any degree aiding
   or abetting therein: it being our determination, for the preservation of
   the peace and happiness of our faithful and loving subjects, to carry the
   laws vigorously into execution against such offenders as aforesaid. Given
   at our Court at the Queen's House, the twenty-first day of May, one
   thousand seven hundred and ninety-two, in the thirty-second year of our
   reign. -- God save the King."

   Soon after this, Mr. Paine's excellent "Letters" to Lord Onslow, to Mr.
   Dundas, and the Sheriff of Sussex were published.

   Mr. Paine's trial for the second part of "Rights of Man" took place on the
   eighteenth of December, 1792, and he being found guilty, the booksellers
   and publishers who were taken up and imprisoned previously to this trial
   forbore to stand one themselves, and suffered judgment to go by default,
   for which they received the sentence of three years' imprisonment each. Of
   these booksellers and publishers I was one, but by flying to France I
   eluded this merciful sentence.

   On the subject of these prosecutions I wrote to Mr. Fox, whom I well knew,
   and my intimate friend for years, Lord Stanhope, as I was myself the
   subject of two of them, and was well acquainted with the party factions of
   the day, and the iniquitous intrigues of the opposing leaders, in and out
   of office; for the writings of Mr. Paine, which were as broad as the
   universe, and having nothing to do with impure elections and auger-hole
   politics, gave equal offense to all sides.

   In the course of these letters, which are still extant, it was impossible
   not to dwell on the absurdity of trial by jury in matters of opinion, and
   the folly of any body of men deciding for others in science and
   speculative discussion, in politics and religion. Is it not applying the
   institution of juries to purposes for which they were not intended, to set
   up twelve men to judge and determine for a whole nation on matters that
   relate to systems and principles of government? A matter of fact may be
   cognizable by a jury, and certainly ascertained with respect to offenses
   against common law and in the ordinary intercourses of society, but on
   matters of political opinion, of taste, of metaphysical inquiry, and of
   religious belief, everyone must be left to decide as his inquiries, his
   experience, and his conviction impel him.

   If the arm of power in every country and on every doctrine could have
   enforced its tyranny, almost all we now possess, and that is valuable,
   would have been destroyed; and if all the governments and factions that
   have made the world miserable could have had their way, everything
   desirable in art, science, philosophy, literature, politics and religion,
   would have been by turns obliterated, and the Bible, the Testament, the
   Alcoran, the writings of Locke, Erasmus, Helvetius, Mercier, Milton,
   Shakespeare, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Swift, Bolanger, Hume, Penn, Tucker,
   Paine, Bacon, Bolingbroke, and of thousands of others on all sides would
   have been burned, nor would there be a printing press in the world.

   It has happened happily for many years past, thanks to the art of printing
   and the means adopted to crush the circulation of knowledge, that the very
   modes employed to accomplish this end have not only proved abortive, but
   have given wings to truth, and diffused it into every corner of the
   universe. The publication of trials containing quotations from the works
   to be put down have disseminated their contents infinitely wider than they
   would else have reached, and have excited inquiries that would otherwise
   have lain dormant.

   So ludicrously did this strike Mr. Paine that his frequent toast was, "The
   best way of advertising good books -- by prosecution."

   As the attorney-general's attacks upon prosecuted works of a clever and
   profound description, and the judges' charges upon them contain nothing
   like argument or refutation, but follow up the criminating and absurd
   language of the indictment or ex-officio information, and breathe only
   declamation and ignorant abuse, they by their weakness expose the cause
   they espouse, and strengthen the truths they affect to destroy.

   I shall close these observations by quoting two old and good humored
   lines:

   Treason does never prosper -- what's the reason?         
   When it prospers -- it is never treason!                 

   This trial of Mr. Paine, and these sentences, subverted of course the very
   end they were intended to effect.

   Mr. Paine was acknowledged deputy for Calais the twenty-first of
   September, 1792. In France, during the early part of the Revolution, his
   time was almost wholly occupied as a deputy of the Convention and as a
   member of the Committee of Constitution. His company was now coveted and
   sought after universally among every description of people, and by many
   who for some reasons never chose to avow it. With the Earl of Lauderdale
   and Dr. Moore, whose company he was fond of, he dined every Friday till
   Lord Gower's departure made it necessary for them to quit France, which
   was early in 1793.

   About this period he removed from White's Hotel to one near the Rue de
   Richelieu, where he was so plagued and interrupted by numerous visitors,
   and sometimes by adventurers, that in order to have some time to himself
   he appropriated two mornings in a week for his levee days. To this indeed
   he was extremely averse, from the fuss and formality attending it, but he
   was nevertheless obliged to adopt it.

   Annoyed and disconcerted with a life so contrary to his wishes and habits,
   and so inimical to his views, he retired to the Faubourg St. Denis, where
   he occupied part of the hotel that Madame de Pompadour once resided in.

   Here was a good garden well laid out, and here, too, our mutual friend,
   Mr. Choppin, occupied apartments: at this residence, which for a town one
   was very quiet, he lived a life of retirement and philosophical ease,
   while it was believed he was gone into the country for his health, which
   by this time indeed was much impaired by intense application to business,
   and by the anxious solicitude he felt for the welfare of public affairs.

   Here, with a chosen few, he unbent himself; among whom were Brissot, the
   Marquis de Chatelet le Roi, of the galerie de honore, and an old friend of
   Dr. Franklin's, Banc,al, and sometimes General Miranda. His English
   associates were Christie and family, Mrs. Wollstonecraft, Mr. and Mrs.
   Stone, etc. Among his American friends were Captain Imlay, Joel Barlow,
   etc., etc. To these parties the French inmates were generally invited.

   Joel Barlow was for many years Mr. Paine's intimate friend, and it was
   from Mr. Paine he derived much of the great knowledge and acuteness of
   talent he possessed.

   Joel Barlow was a great philosopher, and a great poet; but there are spots
   in the sun, and I instance the following littleness in his conduct as a
   warning, and to prove how much of honest fame and character is lost by
   anything like tergiversation.

   Joel Barlow has omitted the name of Mr. Paine in his very fine poem, "The
   Columbiad"; a name essential to the works, as the principal founder of the
   American Republic and of the happiness of its citizens.

   Omitting the name of Mr. Paine in the history of America, and where the
   amelioration of the human race is so much concerned, is like omitting the
   name of Newton in writing the history of his philosophy, or that of God
   when creation is the subject; yet this, Joel Barlow has done, and done so,
   lest the name of Paine, combined with his theological opinions, should
   injure the sale of the poem. Mean and unhandsome conduct!

   He usually rose about seven, breakfasted with his friends, Choppin,
   Johnson, and two or three other Englishmen, and a Monsieur La Borde, who
   had been an officer in the ci-devante garde du corps, an intolerable
   aristocrat, but whose skill in mechanics and geometry brought on a
   friendship between him and Paine: for the undaunted and distinguished
   ability and firmness with which he ever defended his own opinions when
   controverted, do not reflect higher honor upon him than that unbounded
   liberality toward the opinions of others which constituted such a
   prominent feature in his character, and which never suffered mere
   difference of sentiment, whether political or religious, to interrupt the
   harmonious intercourse of friendship, or impede the interchanges of
   knowledge and information.

   After breakfast he usually strayed an hour or two in the garden, where he
   one morning pointed out the kind of spider whose web furnished him with
   the first idea of constructing his iron bridge; a fine model of which, in
   mahogany, is preserved at Paris.

   The little happy circle who lived with him here will ever remember these
   days with delight: with these select friends he would talk of his boyish
   days, play at chess, whist, piques, or cribbage, and enliven the moments
   by many interesting anecdotes: with these he would play at marbles, scotch
   hops, battledores, etc., on the broad and fine gravel walk at the upper
   end of the garden, and then retire to his boudoir, where he was up to his
   knees in letters and papers of various descriptions. Here he remained till
   dinner time, and unless he visited Brissot's family, or some particular
   friend in the evening, which was his frequent custom, he joined again the
   society of his favorites and fellow-boarders, with whom his conversation
   was often witty and cheerful, always acute and improving, but never
   frivolous.

   Incorrupt, straightforward and sincere, he pursued his political course in
   France, as everywhere else, let the government or clamor or faction of the
   day be what it might, with firmness, with clearness, and without a "shadow
   of turning."

   In all Mr. Paine's inquiries and conversations he evinced the strongest
   attachment to the investigation of truth, and was always for going to the
   fountain head for information. He often lamented we had no good history of
   America, and that the letters written by Columbus, the early navigators,
   and others, to the Spanish Court, were inaccessible, and that many
   valuable documents, collected by Philip II, and deposited with the
   national archives at Simania, had not yet been promulgated. He used to
   speak highly of the sentimental parts of Raynal's "History."

   It is not intended to enter into an account of the French Revolution, its
   progress, the different colors it took and aspects it assumed. The history
   of this most important event may be found at large detailed by French
   writers as well as those of other nations, and the world is left to judge
   of it.

   It is unfortunate for mankind that Mr. Paine by imprisonment and the loss
   of his invaluable papers, was prevented giving the best, most candid, and
   philosophical account of these times. These papers contained the history
   of the French Revolution, and were no doubt a most correct,
   discriminating, and enlightened detail of the events of that important
   era. For these papers the historian, Gibbon, sent to France, and made
   repeated application, upon a conviction that they would be impartial,
   profound, and philosophical documents.

   It is well known that Mr. Paine always lamented the turn affairs took in
   France, and grieved at the period we are now adverting to, when corrupt
   influence was rapidly infecting every department of the state. He saw the
   jealousies and animosities that were breeding, and that a turbulent
   faction was forming among the people that would first enslave and
   ultimately overwhelm even the Convention itself.

   On the day of the trial of Marat, Mr. Paine dined at White's Hotel with
   Mr. Milnes, a gentleman of great hospitality and profusion, who usually
   gave a public dinner to twenty or thirty gentlemen once a week. At table,
   among many others besides Mr. Paine, was a Captain Grimstone, who was a
   lineal descendant from Sir Harbottle Grimstone, was a member of Cromwell's
   Parliament and an officer in his army. This man was a high aristocrat, a
   great gambler, and it was believed could not quit France on account of his
   being much in debt. He took little pains to conceal his political
   principles, and when the glass had freely circulated, a short time after
   dinner he attempted, loudly and impertinently, to combat the political
   doctrines of the philosopher; this was, to be sure, the viper biting at
   the file.

   Mr. Paine, in few words, with much acuteness and address, continued
   exposing the fallacy of his reasoning, and rebutting his invectives.

   The Captain became more violent, and waxed so angry, that at length,
   rising from his chair, he walked round the table to where Mr. Paine was
   sitting, and here began a volley of abuse, calling him incendiary, traitor
   to his country, and struck him a violent blow that nearly knocked him off
   his seat. Captain Grimstone was a stout young man about thirty, and Mr.
   Paine at this time nearly sixty.

   The company, who suspected not such an outrage against everything decent,
   mannerly, and just, and who had occasion frequently during dinner to call
   him to order, were now obliged to give him in charge of the National
   Guard. It must be remembered that an act of the Convention had made it
   death to strike a deputy, and every one in company with the person
   committing the assault refusing to give up the offender was considered as
   an accomplice.

   But a short period before this circumstance happened, nine men had been
   decapitated, one of whom had struck Bourdeur de L'oise, at Orleans. The
   other eight were walking with him in the street at the time.

   Paine was extremely agitated when he reflected on the danger of his
   unprovoked enemy, and immediately applied to Barrere, at that time
   president of the Committee of Public Safety, for a passport for the
   unhappy man, who must otherwise have suffered death; and though he found
   the greatest difficulty in effecting this, he however persevered and at
   length accomplished it, at the same time sending Grimstone money to defray
   his traveling expenses; for his passport was of so short a duration that
   he was obliged to go immediately from his prison to the messagerie
   nationale.

   Of Mr. Paine's arrest by Robespierre and his imprisonment, etc., we cannot
   be so well in formed as by himself in his own affecting and interesting
   letters.

   While Mr. Paine was in prison he wrote much of his "Age of Reason," and
   amused himself with carrying on an epistolary correspondence with Lady
   S*** under the assumed name of The Castle in the Air, and her ladyship
   answered under the signature of The Little Corner of the World. This
   correspondence is reported to be extremely beautiful and interesting.

   At this period a deputation of Americans solicited the release of Thomas
   Paine from prison; and as this document, and the way in which it is
   introduced in Mr. Sampson Perry's "History of the French Revolution," bear
   much interest, and are highly honorable to Mr. Paine, the deputation, and
   Mr. Perry, I give it in his own words:

   "As an historian does not write in conformity to the humors or caprice of
   the day, but looks to the mature opinions of a future period, so the
   humble tracer of these hasty sketches, though without pretensions himself
   to live in after times, is nevertheless at once desirous of proving his
   indifference to the unpopularity of the moment, and his confidence in the
   justice posterity will exercise toward one of the greatest friends of the
   human race. The author is the more authorized to pass this eulogium on a
   character already sufficiently renowned, having had the means and the
   occasion of exploring his mind and his qualities, as well with suspicion
   as with confidence.

   "The name of Thomas Paine may excite hatred in some, and inspire terror in
   others. It ought to do neither, he is the friend of all, and it is only
   because reason and virtue are not sufficiently prevalent, that so many do
   not love him: he is not the enemy of those even who are eager to have his
   fate at their disposal. The time may not be far off when they will be glad
   their fate were at his; but the cowardly as well as the brave have
   contributed to fill England with dishonor for silently allowing the best
   friends of the human race to be persecuted with a virulence becoming the
   darkest ages only.

   "The physical world is in rapid movement, the moral advances perhaps as
   quick; that part of it which is dark now will be light; when it shall have
   but half revolved, men and things will be seen more clearly, and he will
   be most esteemed by the good who shall have made the largest sacrifice to
   truth and public virtue. Thomas Paine was suspected of having checked the
   aspiring light of the public mind by opinions not suitable to the state
   France was in. He was for confiding more to the pen, and doubting the
   effect of the guillotine.

   "Robespierre said, that method would do with such a country as America,
   but could avail nothing in one highly corrupted like France. To disagree
   in opinion with a mind so heated was to incur all the resentment it
   contained. Thomas Paine had preserved an intimacy with Brissot from an
   acquaintance of long date, and because he spoke the English language; when
   Brissot fell, Paine was in danger, and, as his preface to the second part
   of the 'Rights of Man,' shows, he had a miraculous escape.

   "The Americans in Paris saw the perilous situation of their
   fellow-citizen, of the champion of the liberty of more than one-quarter of
   the world; they drew up an address and presented it at the bar of the
   Convention; it was worded as follows:

   "'Citizens! the French nation had invited the most illustrious of all
   foreign nations to the honor of representing her.

   "'Thomas Paine, the apostle of liberty in America, a profound and valuable
   philosopher, a virtuous and esteemed citizen, came to France and took a
   seat among you. Particular circumstances rendered necessary the decree to
   put under arrest all the English residing in France.

   "'Citizens! representatives! we come to demand of you Thomas Paine, in the
   name of the friends of liberty, in the name of the Americans your brothers
   and allies; was there anything more wanted to obtain our demand we would
   tell you. Do not give to the leagued despots the pleasure of seeing Paine
   in irons. We shall inform you that the seals put upon the papers of Thomas
   Paine have been taken off, that the Committee of General Safety examined
   them, and far from finding among them any dangerous propositions, they
   only found the love of liberty which characterized him all his lifetime,
   that eloquence of nature and philosophy which made him the friend of
   mankind, and those principles of public morality which merited the hatred
   of kings and the affection of his fellow-citizens.

   "'In short, citizens! if you permit us to restore Thomas Paine to the
   embraces of his fellow-citizens we offer to pledge ourselves as security
   for his conduct during the short time he shall remain in France.'"

   After his liberation he found a friendly asylum at the American Minister's
   house, Mr. Monroe, and for some years before Mr. Paine left Paris, he
   lodged at M. Bonneville's, associating occasionally with the great men of
   the day, Condorcet, Volney, Mercier, Joel Barlow, etc., etc., and
   sometimes dining-with Bonaparte and his generals.* He now indulged his
   mechanical turn and amused himself in bridge and ship modeling, and in
   pursuing his favorite studies, the mathematics and natural philosophy.
   "These models," says a correspondent of that time, "exhibit an
   extraordinary degree not only of skill but of taste in mechanics, and are
   wrought with extreme delicacy entirely by his own hands. The largest of
   these, the model of a bridge, is nearly four feet in length: the
   iron-works, the chains, and every other article belonging to it were
   forged and manufactured by himself. It is intended as a model of a bridge
   which is to be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet with
   only one arch. The other is to be erected over a narrower river, whose
   name I forget, and is likewise a single arch, and of his own workmanship
   excepting the chains, which instead of iron are cut out of pasteboard, by
   the fair hands of his correspondent, The Little Corner of the World, whose
   indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary. He was offered -L-3,000 for
   these models and refused it. He also forged himself the model of a crane
   of a new description, which when put together exhibited the power of the
   lever to a most surprising degree."

   This anecdote is only related as a fact. Of the     
   sincerity of the compliment, those may judge who    
   know Bonaparte's principles best.

   * Footnote:                                       
   When Bonaparte returned from Italy he called on   
   Mr. Paine and invited him to dinner: in the       
   course of his rapturous address to him he         
   declared that a statue of gold ought to be        
   erected to him in every city in the universe,     
   assuring him that he always slept with his book   
   "Rights of Man" under his pillow and conjured him 
   to honor him with his correspondence and advice.  

   During this time he also published his "Dissertation on First Principles
   of Government," his "Essay on Finance," his first and second part of the
   "Age of Reason," his "Letter to Washington," his "Address to the
   Theophilanthropists," "Letter to Erskine," etc., etc. Poetry, too,
   employed his idle hours, and he produced some fine pieces, which the world
   will probably one day see.

   Wearied with the direction things took in France, which he used to say,
   was "the promised land, but not the land of promise," he had long sighed
   for his own dear America.

   "It is," he would say, "the country of my heart and the place of my
   political and literary birth. It was the American Revolution made me an
   author, and forced into action the mind that had been dormant and had no
   wish for public life, nor has it now." Mr. Paine made many efforts to
   cross the Atlantic, but they were ineffectual.

   In July, 1802, Mr. Jefferson, the then President of America, in a letter
   to Mr. Paine writes thus:

   "You express a wish in your letter to return to America by a national
   ship.

   "Mr. Dawson, who brings over the treaty, and who will present you this
   letter, is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland, to receive
   and accommodate you back if you can be ready to return at such a short
   warning. You will in general find us returned to sentiments worthy of
   former times; in these it will be your glory to have steadily labored, and
   with as much effect as any man living. That you may live long to continue
   your useful labors, and reap the reward in the thankfulness of nations, is
   my sincere prayer. Accept the assurance of my high esteem and affectionate
   attachment.

   "Thomas Jefferson."

   Washington, July, 1802.

   By the Maryland, as Mr. Paine states, he did not go; and it was not till
   the first of September, 1802, after spending some time with him at Havre
   de Grace, that I took leave of him on his departure for America, in a ship
   named the London Pacquet, just ten years after his leaving my house in
   London.

   The ardent desire which Mr. Paine ever had to retire to and dwell in his
   beloved America is strongly portrayed in the following letter to a female
   friend in that country, written some years before.

   "You touch me on a very tender point when you say that my friends on your
   side of the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of my abandoning
   America even for my native England.

   "They are right, I had rather see my horse 'Button' eating the grass of
   Borden Town or Morrisania, than see all the pomp and show of Europe.

   "A thousand years hence, for I must indulge a few thoughts, perhaps in
   less, America may be what Europe now is. The innocence of her character
   that won the hearts of all nations in her favor may sound like a romance,
   and her inimitable virtue as if it had never been.

   "The ruins of that liberty for which thousands bled may just furnish
   materials for a village tale, or extort a sigh from rustic sensibility,
   while the fashionable of that day, enveloped in dissipation, shall deride
   the principles and deny the fact.

   "When we contemplate the fall of empires and the extinction of the nations
   of the ancient world we see but little more to excite our regret than the
   moldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty pyramids,
   and walls and towers of the most costly workmanship; but when the empire
   of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow will be
   infinitely greater than crumbling brass or marble can inspire. It will not
   then be said, here stood a temple of vast antiquity, here rose a babel of
   invisible height, or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance; but here
   (ah! painful thought!) the noblest work of human wisdom, the grandest
   scene of human glory, and the fair cause of freedom, rose and fell! Read
   this, and then ask if I forget America."

   There is so uncommon a degree of interest, and that which conveys an idea
   of so much heart intercourse in this letter, that the reader may be led to
   desire some knowledge of the person to whom it was addressed. This lady's
   name was I believe Nicholson, and afterwards the wife of Colonel Few;
   between her and Mr. Paine a very affectionate attachment and sincere
   regard subsisted, and it was no small mortification on his final return to
   New York to be totally neglected by her and her husband.

   But against the repose of Mr. Paine's dying moments there seems to have
   been a conspiracy, and this lady after years of disregard and inattention
   sought Mr. Paine on his death bed.

   Mr. Few was with her, but Mr. Paine, refusing to shake hands with her,
   said firmly and very impressively, "You have neglected me, and I beg you
   will leave the room."

   Mrs. Few went into the garden, and wept bitterly.

   Of Mr. Paine's reception in America and some interesting account of his
   own life and its vicissitudes, his "Letters to the Citizens of America,"
   before noticed, speak better than I can.

   These letters, under the care of Mr. Monroe, he sent me in 1804, and I
   published them, with the following one of his own accompanying them.

   "My dear Friend,

   "Mr. Monroe, who is appointed Minister Extraordinary to France, takes
   charge of this, to be delivered to Mr. Este, banker in Paris, to be
   forwarded to you.

   "I arrived at Baltimore, thirtieth of October, and you can have no idea of
   the agitation which my arrival occasioned. From New Hampshire to Georgia
   (an extent of 1,500 miles) every newspaper was filled with applause or
   abuse.

   "My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and is
   now worth six thousand pounds sterling; which put in the funds will bring
   me -L-400 sterling a year.

   "Remember me in friendship and affection to your wife and family, and in
   the circle of our friends.

   "I am but just arrived here, and the Minister sails in a few hours, so
   that I have just time to write you this. If he should not sail this tide I
   will write to my good friend Colonel Bosville, but in any case I request
   you to wait on him for me.

   "Yours in friendship,

   "Thomas Paine."

   What course he meant to pursue in America, his own words will best tell,
   and best characterize his sentiments and principles: they are these:

   "As this letter is intended to announce my arrival to my friends, and my
   enemies if I have any, for I ought to have none in America, and as
   introductory to others that will occasionally follow, I shall close it by
   detailing the line of conduct I shall pursue.

   "I have no occasion to ask, nor do I intend to accept, any place or office
   in the Government.

   "There is none it could give me that would in any way be equal to the
   profits I could make as an author (for I have an established fame in the
   literary world) could I reconcile it to my principles to make money by my
   politics or religion; I must be in everything as I have ever been, a
   disinterested volunteer. My proper sphere of action is on the common floor
   of citizenship, and to honest men I give my hand and my heart freely.

   "I have some manuscript works to publish, of which I shall give proper
   notice, and some mechanical affairs to bring forward, that will employ all
   my leisure time.

   "I shall continue these letters as I see occasion, and as to the low party
   prints that choose to abuse me, they are welcome; I shall not descend to
   answer them. I have been too much used to such common stuff to take any
   notice of it.

   "Thomas Paine.

   "City of Washington."

   From this period to the time of his death, which was the ninth of June,
   1809, Mr. Paine lived principally at New York, and on his estate at New
   Rochelle, publishing occasionally some excellent things in the Aurora
   newspaper, also "An Essay on the Invasion of England," "On the Yellow
   Fever," "On Gun-Boats, etc., etc.," and in 1807, "An Examination of the
   Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old, and Called Prophecies
   Concerning Jesus Christ, etc."

   This is a most acute, profound, clear, argumentative, and entertaining
   work, and may be considered and is now entitled "The Third Part of the Age
   of Reason."

   In the course of Mr. Paine's life, he was often reminded of a reply he
   once made to this observation of Dr. Franklin's, "Where liberty is, there
   is my country:" Mr. Paine's retort was, "Where liberty is not, there is my
   country." And, unfortunately, he had occasion for many years in Europe to
   realize the truth of his axiom.

   Soon after Mr. Paine's arrival in America, he invited over Mr. and Mrs.
   Bonneville and their children. At Bonneville's house at Paris he had for
   years found a home, a friendly shelter, when the difficulty of getting
   supplies of money from America, and other and many ills assailed him.
   Bonneville and his family were poor, and sunk in the world, Mr. Paine
   therefore, though he was not their inmate without remuneration, offered
   them an asylum with him in America. Mrs. Bonneville and her three boys, to
   whom he was a friend during his life and at his death, soon joined him
   there.

   The particulars of Mr. Paine being shot at while sitting by his fireside
   at New Rochelle are given in his own letters. The bullet from the fire-arm
   shattered the glass over the chimney-piece very near to him. I find a
   letter in reply to one of mine, in which he writes, "the account you heard
   of a man's firing into my house is true -- the grand jury found the bill
   against him, and he lies over for trial."

   In January, 1809, Mr. Paine became very feeble and infirm, so much so, as
   to be scarcely capable of doing anything for himself.

   During this illness he was pestered on every hand with the intrusive and
   impertinent visits of the bigoted, the fanatic, and the designing. To
   entertain the reader, some specimens of the conduct of these intruders are
   here given.

   He usually took a nap after dinner, and would not be disturbed let who
   would call to see him. One afternoon a very old lady dressed in a large,
   scarlet, hooded cloak knocked at the door and inquired for Thomas Paine.
   Mr. Jarvis, with whom Mr. Paine resided, told her he was asleep.

   "I am very sorry," she said, "for that, for I want to see him
   particularly."

   Thinking it a pity to make an old woman call twice, Mr. Jarvis took her
   into Mr. Paine's bed room, and awoke him. He rose upon one elbow, and
   then, with an expression of eye that made the old woman stagger back a
   step or two, he asked,

   "What do you want?"

   "Is your name Paine?"

   "Yes."

   "Well then, I come from Almighty God to tell you that if you do not repent
   of your sins, and believe in our Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, you will be
   damned, and -- "

   "Poh, poh, it is not true," replied Paine, "you were not sent with any
   such impertinent message. Jarvis make her go away: pshaw! He would not
   send such a foolish, ugly old woman about with His messages; go away, go
   back, shut the door."

   The old lady retired, raised both her hands, kept them so, and without
   saying another word walked away in mute astonishment.

   The following is a curious example of a friendly, neighborly visit.

   About two weeks before his death he was visited by the Rev. Mr.
   Milledollar, a Presbyterian minister of great eloquence, and the Rev. Mr.
   Cunningham. The latter gentleman said:

   "Mr. Paine, we visit you as friends and neighbors. You have now a full
   view of death, you cannot live long, and whoever does not believe in Jesus
   Christ will assuredly be damned."

   "Let me," said Paine, "have none of your popish stuff. Get away with you.
   Good morning, Sir, good morning."

   The Rev. Mr. Milledollar attempted to address him but he was interrupted
   in the same language. When they were gone, he said to Mrs. Hedden, his
   housekeeper, "do not let them come here again, they intrude upon me."

   They soon renewed their visit, but Mrs. Hedden told them they could not be
   admitted, and that she thought the attempt useless, for if God did not
   change his mind, she was sure no human power could. They retired.

   Among others, the Rev. Mr. Hargrove, minister of a new sect called the New
   Jerusalemites, once accosted him with this impertinent stuff:

   "My name is Hargrove, Sir; I am a minister of the New Jerusalem Church.
   We, Sir, explain the Scripture in its true meaning; the key has been lost
   these four thousand years, and we have found it."

   "Then," said Paine in his own neat way, "it must have been very rusty."

   In his last moments he was very anxious to die, and also very solicitous
   about the mode of his burial; for as he was completely unchanged in his
   theological sentiments, he would on no account, even after death,
   countenance ceremonies he disapproved, containing doctrines and
   expressions of a belief which he conscientiously objected to, and had
   spent a great part of his life in combating.

   He wished to be interred in the Quakers' burying ground, and on this
   subject he requested to see Mr. Willet Hicks, a member of the Society, who
   called on him in consequence.

   Mr. Paine, after the usual salutations, said, "As I am going to leave one
   place it is necessary to provide another; I am now in my seventy-third
   year, and do not expect to live long; I wish to be buried in your burying
   ground."

   He said his father was a Quaker, and that he thought better of the
   principles of that Society than any other, and approved their mode of
   burial. This request of Mr. Paine was refused, very much to the discredit
   of those who did so; and as the Quakers are not unused to grant such
   indulgences, in this case it seemed to arise from very little and unworthy
   motives and prejudices on the part of those who complied not with this
   earnest and unassuming solicitation.

   The above named Quaker in a conversation of a serious nature with Mr.
   Paine, a short time before his death, was assured by him that his
   sentiments respecting the Christian religion were now precisely the same
   as when he wrote the "Age of Reason."

   About the fourth of May, symptoms of approaching dissolution became very
   evident to himself, and he soon fell off his milk-punch, and became too
   infirm to take anything; complaining of much bodily pain.

   On the eighth of June, 1809, about nine in the morning, he placidly, and
   almost without a struggle, died, as he had lived, a Deist.

   Why so much consequence should be attached to what is called a recantation
   in a man's last moments of a belief or opinion held through life, a thing
   I never witnessed nor knew anyone who did, it is difficult to say, at
   least with any credit, to those who harp so much upon it. A belief or an
   opinion is none the less correct or true even if it be recanted, and I
   strenuously urge the reader to reflect seriously, how few there are who
   really have any fixed belief and conviction through life of a metaphysical
   or religious nature; how few who devote any time to such investigation, or
   who are not the creatures of form, education, and habit; and take upon
   trust tenets, instead of inquiring into their truth and rationality.
   Indeed it appears that those who are so loud about the recantation of
   philosophers, are neither religious, moral, or correct themselves, and
   exhibit not in their own lives, either religion in belief, or principle in
   conduct.

   Paine was aged seventy-two years and five months. At nine of the clock in
   the forenoon of the ninth of June, the day after his decease, he was taken
   from his house at Greenwich, attended by seven persons, to New Rochelle;
   where he was afterwards interred on his own farm. A stone has been placed
   at the head of his grave according to the direction in his will, with the
   following inscription:

                                 THOMAS PAINE,
                                   AUTHOR OF
                                 COMMON SENSE,
                 Died June 8,1809, Aged 72 Years and 5 Months.

   The reader must from the foregoing pages be persuaded how unkindly teased
   and obtrusively tormented were the closing hours of Mr. Paine's life;
   hours that always should be soothed by tenderness, quietude, and every
   kind attention, and in which the mind generally loses all its strength and
   energy, and is as unlike its former self as its poor suffering companion
   the body.

            Infirmity doth still neglect all office,                 
            Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves        
            When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind          
            To suffer with the body. -- Shakespeare.                 

   To a rational man it should seem that a Deist, if he be so from principle,
   and he is as likely to be so as any other religionist, is no more to be
   expected to renounce his principles on his deathbed or to abandon his
   belief at that moment, than the Christian, the Jew, the Mahometan, or any
   other religionist.

   It will be seen that Mr. Paine very early, when a mere child, was inspired
   as it were with the anti-Christian principles which he held religiously
   through life.

   His philosophical and astronomical pursuits could not but confirm him in
   the most exalted, the most divine ideas of a supreme being, and in the
   purity and sublimity of Deism.

   A belief in millions of millions of inhabited worlds, millions of millions
   of miles apart, necessarily leads the mind to the worship of a God
   infinitely above the one described by those religionists who speak and
   write of Him as they do, and as if He were only the maker of our earth,
   and as alone being interested in what concerns it. In contemplating the
   immense works of God, "the creation" is the only book of revelation in
   which the Deist can believe; and his religion consists in contemplating
   the power, wisdom, and benignity of God in His glorious works, and
   endeavoring to imitate Him in everything moral, scientific and mechanical.
   It cannot be urged too strongly, so much wrongheadedness if not
   wrongheartedness is there on this subject, that the religion of the Deist
   no more precludes the blessed hope of salvation than that of the Christian
   or of any other religion.

   We see through different mediums, and in our pursuits and experience are
   unlike. How others have felt after reading maturely the "Age of Reason"
   and the "Rights of Man," and pursuing fairly, coolly, and assiduously the
   subjects therein treated, I leave to them; but for myself I must say,
   these works carried perfect conviction with them to my mind, and the
   opinions they contain are fully confirmed by much reading, by long,
   honest, unwearied investigation and observation.

   The best and wisest of human beings both male and female that I have known
   through life have been Deists, nor did anything in the shape of their
   recantation either in life or death ever come to my knowledge, nor can I
   understand how a real, serious, and long-adopted belief can be recanted.

   That Mr. Paine's religious belief had been long established and was with
   him a deep-rooted principle, may be seen by his conduct when imprisoned
   and extremely ill in the Luxembourg prison in 1794.*

   Mr. Bond, an English surgeon who was confined there at the same time,
   though by no means a friend to Mr. Paine's political or theological
   doctrines, gave me the following testimony of Mr. Paine's sentiments:

   "Mr. Paine, while hourly expecting to die, read to me parts of his 'Age of
   Reason'; and every night when I left him to be separately locked up, and
   expected not to see him alive in the morning, he always expressed his firm
   belief in the principles of that book, and begged I would tell the world
   such were his dying opinions. He often said that if he lived he should
   prosecute further that work, and print it." Mr. Bond's frequent
   observation when speaking of Mr. Paine was, that he was the most
   conscientious man he ever knew.

   While upon this subject, it will probably occur to the reader, as well as
   to the writer, how little belief from inquiry and principle there is in
   the world; and how much oftener religious profession is adopted from
   education, form, prudence, fear, and a variety of other motives, than from
   unprejudiced inquiry, a love of truth, of free discussion, and from entire
   conviction. Reasoning thus, it may fairly be inferred that men like Mr.
   Paine, a pious Deist, of deep research, laborious inquiry, and critical
   examination, are the most likely from disinterested motives to adopt
   opinions, and of course the least likely to relinquish them.

   Before I quit the subject I give the following authentic document,
   received in a letter from New York:

   "Sir: I witnessed a scene last night which occasioned sensations only to
   be felt, not to be described; the scene alluded to was no less
   extraordinary than the beholding the well-known Thomas Paine struggling to
   retain a little longer in connection his soul and body. For near an hour I
   sat by the bedside of that well-known character, to whom I was introduced
   by one of his friends. Could the memory have retained the suggestions of
   my mind in the moments when I was reviewing the pallid looks of him who
   had attempted to overthrow kingdoms and monarchies, of him who had
   astonished the world with the fruits of a vast mind, whose works have
   caused a great part of mankind to think and feel as they never did before,
   such suggestions would not be uninteresting to you. I could not
   contemplate the approaching dissolution of such a man, see him gasping for
   breath, without feelings of a peculiar nature. Poor Paine's body has given
   way before his mind, which is yet firm; mortification seems to have taken
   up its dwelling in his frame, and he will soon be no more. With respect to
   his principles he will die as he has lived; they are unaltered.

   "Some Methodists went to him a few days ago to endeavor to make a convert
   of him, but he would not listen to their entreaties."

   Before I take leave of my reader I would press upon his mind the necessity
   of candor; and if he be a Christian I must tell him he will cease to be so
   the moment he appeals to coercion and resorts to prosecution and to
   persecution in matters of belief and opinion: such conduct his own "New
   Testament" is decidedly against. It is better not to believe in a God than
   to believe unworthily of Him, and the less we make Him after our image the
   less we blaspheme Him. Let inquiry supersede calumny and censure, and let
   it be ever remembered that those systems in government and religion which
   will not bear discussion and investigation are not worth solicitude.
   Ignorance is the only original sin; spread information and knowledge, and
   virtue and truth will follow.

   Oppose argument to argument, reason to reason, opinion to opinion, book to
   book, truth must prevail; and that which is of divine origin will bring
   itself through.

   Set not attorney-generals and human laws at work, nor pay any religion
   which boasts an heavenly origin so bad a compliment, or libel its
   founders, by endeavoring to support it by such infamous means.

   How paltry, how detestable, is that criticism which only seeks to find out
   and dwell on errors and inaccuracies; passing over in silence, what is
   grand, sublime, and useful! How still more paltry, and detestable, is that
   disposition, which seeks only to find out and dwell on the defects and
   foibles of character!

   While Mr. Paine's enemies have labored, and are still laboring, to detect
   vices and errors in his life and manners, shall not his friends dwell on
   the immense good he has done in public life, on the happiness he has
   created for myriads, in private? Shall they not point to the abodes of
   delight and comfort, where live and flourish the blessings of domestic
   bliss; affection's dear intercourses, friendship's solaces, and love's
   sacred enjoyments? And there are millions of such abodes originating in
   his labors. Why seek occasion, surly critics and detractors! to maltreat
   and misrepresent Mr. Paine? He was mild, unoffending, sincere, gentle,
   humble, and unassuming; his talents were soaring, acute, profound,
   extensive, and original; and he possessed that charity, which covers a
   multitude of sins.
