   Paine was a strong advocate for women's equal rights, but he did not
   promote it publicly. His early writings reflect sympathy for women's
   social, economic and political rights. He associated and worked closely
   with Mary Wollstonecraft in England in the early 1790's while he wrote
   Rights of Man, and she wrote the feminist manifesto Vindication of the
   Rights of Women. It was a subject often put aside by the democratic
   movement in the 18th century which tried to rally the working men towards
   revolutionary change, and many, including Paine, held personal beliefs in
   favor of women's equality, but feared it would sidetrack the main thrust
   of changing governmental structures. Abolition of slavery took a more
   prominent role since it directly affected the corrupt power structure.
   They didn't see how women's rights were just as vital.
