   Yes. Previously it was claimed that American Crisis II was the
   source of this name. There are at least three private letters who
   use the language "United States of America", but two of them use
   "united" (small "U") as an adjective. However, writing as
   "Republicus" on June 29, 1776 Paine made the first public
   declaration calling for the country to be named the "United States
   of America".
