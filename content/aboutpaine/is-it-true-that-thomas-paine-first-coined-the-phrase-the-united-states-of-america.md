   Yes. In American Crisis II.  However there are some who refute that. One
   claim is that the Declaration of Independence uses it: but it uses it with
   a small "u" in united, as was common in the years leading up to the war
   (united Colonies, united States, etc.). Another claim is from a letter in
   June, 1776 from a Virginia planter, but he too uses"united states of
   America" in lower case. It was Paine in January of 1777, one year after
   Common Sense, that the name was made official by its use in capitals, and
   sunk into the subconscious of the nation.
