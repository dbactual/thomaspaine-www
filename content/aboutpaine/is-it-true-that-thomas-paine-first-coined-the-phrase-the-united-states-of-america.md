   Yes. Previously it was claimed that American Crisis III was the
   source of this name. There are at least two private letters who
   use the language "united States of America", but they use
   "united" (small "U") as an adjective. However, writing as
   "Republicus" on June 29, 1776 Paine made the first <em>public</em>
   declaration calling for the country to be named the "United States
   of America", which he knew appeared on the Declaration of Independence soon to be released.
