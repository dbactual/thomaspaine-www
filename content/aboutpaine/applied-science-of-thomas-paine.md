*Applied Science of Thomas Paine, Inventor of the United States of America, in the Physical and Organizational Domains*

Albert DiCanzio

An essay based on the author's presentation at the First Annual International Conference of Thomas Paine Studies, 19 October 2012 with a few script revisions
in year 2020

In the interest of more deeply understanding the phrase "the republic for which it stands" in the pledge of allegiance to this flag, let us explore a tripartite
proposition. I refer to this exploration as a proposition because, in the allotted time on our schedule, we can undertake no proof but at most explanation of these
conclusions.  First, that the United States of America, unlike many if not all other nations, is an invention; by this term I mean: a novel application of design
principles embodied in a durable mechanism. Second, that its inventor was that quintessential cosmopolitan Thomas Paine.  Third, that it falls to participants and
followers of this conference, who care about him, to help shore up his design against the ravages of past neglect and future abuse.  In thus honoring Paine and his
legacy, I propose that we honor a call to action inherent in that legacy, to fully implement his design of a cultural and political paradigm shift, that is, to
complete the still incomplete American Revolution.

Do not imagine that I hold Paine first among scientists to call for a cultural paradigm shift.  Galileo had thus preceded Paine, as seen in a story I recounted.(1)
By disproving the Ptolemaic cosmology, Galileo gave credibility to notions of geokinesis and of self-directed society,(2)  relocating Earth away from the center of
planetary motions while laying groundwork for Paine to compensate for lost centrality by placing a self-directed society at the center of a world formerly dominated
by monarchic and dynastic rule.  By also discovering dynamics, Galileo revolutionized how we harness natural laws of a vast universe in which terrestrials now see
their unfavored position offering no ready alternative to getting along with fellow inhabitants of an Earth that Galileo largely proved to be a planet. Just as
through his writing, Galileo taught physics to Newton; both men enlightened Thomas Paine, who expanded the Newtonian revolution by treating human behavior on the
scale of a nation as a natural phenomenon.

In *Rights of Man*, part 2, we read "What Archimedes said of the mechanical powers may be applied to Reason and Liberty. 'Had we', said he, 'a place to stand upon,
we might raise the world.'"  More than a change of "persons and measures", the nascent United States embodied in one nation of free and independent states a change
of principles and synthesis of ideas that marked out a position on which to freely apply the lever of reason. We see this in hindsight because, unlike some
unrealized or fleeting utopian dream, its design, though imperfect, has stood a test of time, following its encapsulation in durable founding documents. How did
that design come about?  Paine synthesized Locke's philosophy with the laws of mechanics of Galilei-Newton into the separation of the colonies as an exercise of
natural rights with a Constitution and autogovernance, writing: "The revolution of America presented in politics what was only theory in mechanics."(3)

In *The Life and Works of Thomas Paine*(4) one finds Thomas Edison having referred to the totality of Paine's works as "a crystallization of acute human reasoning"
and to his specific work Common Sense as embodying "... Paine's planning of this great American republic, of which he may very justly be termed the real founder".

Edison's two observations confirmed me in the intent to consider this question: How did Paine's immersion in post-Newtonian scientific thinking cross-fertilize the
fiery patriotic writings? A first clue to his rhetorical color and inspiration held firm on an inferential track lies in scientific clarity of thought and language.
As we now visit elements of Paine's story, there may arise additional clues both in the scope of his writings and in that of his inventiveness,(5)  including uses of
laws concerning energy, momentum, leverage, and even the spiderweb as a model.

In 1775, despite massive British interference in colonial affairs, few leading American colonists favored separation. A year later they declared independence. What
had happened in the interim? In January 1776, Paine released Common Sense. Ultimately it sold 120,000 copies, inspired the colonies to independence, and enabled
Washington to raise an army. The energy transfer of idea-disclosure, amplified by this factor (i.e., the transition from the first reader to all those that followed),
became re-amplified by the Declaration of Rights for Pennsylvania, of which Franklin was an author and principal intellectual architect, and Paine was a source of
philosophical influence. Together they formed an intellectual backdrop for the bill of rights, each amplification resulting from leverage on the fulcrum of Paine's
formidable pen. In Rights of Man Paine told us that he applied mechanical principles to the American Revolution. What passion drove him to scientize the social
domain?

Aside from the United States, of which he is also arguably the inventor, there were at least six known inventions by Paine, of which he modeled five of these six:

1.	A smokeless candle that he sent to Franklin in 1785, along with a description of its operating principle.
2.	An automotive carriage with wheels rotating by thrust of exploding gunpowder.  In this application of the 3rd law of Galilei-Newtonian mechanics,
Paine had put gunpowder to a peaceful use.
3.	An improved crane.
4.	A turbine to propel a steamboat, un-modeled, yet John Fitch, James Rumsey and Robert Fulton, all of whom were granted U.S. patents relating to the steamboat,
recognized Paine as its original inventor.  By shrinking the time to traverse distance, the steamboat accelerated the conversion of coastal colonies to a continental
commercial powerhouse.
5.	A patented method of constructing arches, vaulted roofs and ceilings, derived from Paine's examination of a spiderweb, and culminating in the iron bridge of
1787-1788.  The Sunderland Bridge(6) built at Wearmouth, England in 1796 was designed by Paine with a single cast iron 236-foot-span hingeless arch, an inverted
catenary that, like the cycloid advocated earlier by Galileo for bridge construction, yet even more effectively, increased the span without a central support.(7)
6.	A machine for planing wood, used in building models of his bridge.

From the invention fortifying a network of bridge components, Paine modeled a robust network topology for a web of associations among freedom-seeking individuals.
The American revolution had thus come to model the Newtonian one.

Analogously to Occam's Razor used in physics to winnow the best competing explanation of natural phenomena, Paine extracted governmental robustness from simplicity
and order in nature, a process in which, he wrote, "I draw my idea of the form of government from a principle implicit in nature which no art can overturn: that the
more simple any thing the less liable it is to be disordered, and the easier repaired when disordered."(8) Invoking the metaphor of a pulley for checks and balances
in essential governmental forms, he wrote: "... for as the greater weight will always carry up the less, and as all the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one,
it only remains to know which power in the constitution has the most weight, for that will govern; ..." In the Renaissance, Galileo had reached back to ancient Greece,
reviving Ionian science from the Dark Ages to create dynamics, groundwork for Newton's system of the world. By 1776, Newton's reformulation of Galilean dynamics had
blossomed in physics, yet remained unapplied to the social domain, until the then-future Paine arrived to apply it.

Paralleling Galileo, Paine turned to that once vibrant era of Athenian democracy to restore and advance autogovernance. The colonies, he explained, will separate
and re-form under a declaration of rights, a constitution, and a vacuum of royalty.  In 1787, he acknowledged the incompleteness of the American Revolution.(9) Though
a second outcome awaited its completion, Paine initially transposed Newtonian momentum to the social domain. Incomplete because it opposed only the most visible
slavery, yet this transposition promoted life with liberty and respect for individual property. Inadvertently, 125 years later another inventor elaborated on what
Paine had done. The functional relationship of Thomas Paine to Nikola Tesla first came to mind in research of mine aimed at grounding organizational dynamics in
physical dynamics, of which Galileo was the creator.(10)

Tesla, inventor of polyphase alternating current power distribution, in 1900 modeled a human as "a mass urged on by a force".(11)   Human energy he thought measurable
by "half the human mass multiplied with the square of a velocity which we are not yet able to compute."(12)   With this non-translatory velocity he associated a human's
"degree of enlightenment."  Laxity of morals, as manifested in organized warfare, was a mass-reducing phenomenon, against which a way to "reduce the force retarding
the human mass" would be to eliminate "frictional resistances" such as ignorance. That goal, in turn, called for rational planning whose direction lies "along the
resultant of all those efforts" designated as "self-preserving, useful, profitable, or practical".(13)  Under this concept (i.e., Tesla's concept, my observation) Paine
had designed a nation with less friction, and the possibility of rational planning, in an initial condition of autogovernance as a place to stand for launching human
achievement. Though Tesla did not elaborate "self-preserving", Paine proposed that government should assist in providing a secure foundation (i.e., safety from
attacks on property) for the pursuit of happiness.(14)

There is more to be observed about the link between Paine and the enlightenment progress of combining science and political structures. I begin a list of the "more
to be observed" with axiomatization and postulation. These are institutionalized in science. Their use in politics is illustrated by the phrases "we hold these
truths to be self-evident" and "the laws of nature ..." and "We the people".  A principle formulated by Paine that I infer to be infrastructural to the Constitutional
provision that "We the people" grant and limit the powers of the United States is:

"Mankind are not now to be told they shall not think, or they shall not read; and publications that go no farther than to investigate principles of government, to
invite men to reason and to reflect, and to show the errors and excellences of different systems, have a right to appear".(15)

Such telltale expressions of ideas as self-evident truths, laws of nature, and thinking people, that can be found in documents known to have been influenced, if not
also written by Paine in draft form, are marks of an applied scientist and technical innovator.

No less in importance is Paine's insistence on defining concepts and his habit of defining terms with great care and explanation, the mark of the mathematician that
Paine was, and eminently so in the New World.  Of a constitution he wrote: "... it will be first necessary to define what is meant by a Constitution. It is not
sufficient that we adopt the word; we must fix also a standard signification to it. ... A constitution is a thing antecedent to a government, and a government is
only the creature of a constitution. The constitution of a country is not the act of its government, but of the people constituting its government."  This preamble
is followed immediately by his definition of "Constitution".(16)

Another category of "more" evidence for Paine's inventorship of the U.S.A. is found in his attempts to encourage an evidence-based discourse, for example, with
Edmund Burke, with whom he poignantly disagreed, reacting by issuing Rights of Man.  This habit of communication can be compared with a method of controversy found
in analysis of Galileo's dialogues, the first in history (known to me) to aim dialogue at truth-seeking rather than, as in politics or in courtrooms today, at
polemicizing toward some pre-conceived conclusion. The Galilean Dialogue on the Two World Systems aims at transforming disagreement into exposure and evaluation
of facts and reasoning on both sides of it into common understanding through open-minded, fair-minded, and rational-minded evaluation of that with which one at first
may disagree.(17)

In my own professional experience in the development and testing of mathematical models of business products and processes, I observed that the creation of
predictive hypotheses and the design of tests that would evaluate them often require mathematical tools that include statistics, combinatorics, curve-fitting,
linear programming, Newtonian approximation, decision analysis, flow systems theory, and theory of competitive strategies. For the most part, development of such
tools post-dated the life of Paine, yet clearly it was not in a mathematical vacuum that he invented the iron bridge and several other aforementioned novelties.
Some such mathematical tools may be used here and there in elements of political practice. They are essential in the implementation of restoring and completing the
American Revolution - "restoring" because after Paine the power center that Eisenhower called the "military industrial complex" and includes "government" and the
central bank may be seen as substituting for the centralized authoritarian rule of the monarch George III.

Finally, a complete list of "more" evidence for Paine's inventorship of the United States would require a modern explanation of grounding organizational dynamics
in post-Newtonian physical dynamics.  This is my one of my personal projects which began in [3], about which a great deal more is to be done. That entire important
subtopic would exceed my time and space limits here.

As an instance of science starting with first principles, Common Sense first postulated society distinct from government.  Paine had proclaimed in Common Sense the
need to declare independence; he was known as the foremost writer in the colonies; a Librarian of Congress(18) found Jefferson's first draft copied from an earlier
document; Paine exclaimed "The decree is finally gone forth. Britain and America are now distinct empires",(19) about the time of the appointment by Congress of a
committee to draft the Declaration.

Regardless of the extent to which Paine may have been influenced the fundamental documents of the United States of America, a nation whose name and original support
are due to him, the friendship and cooperation of Benjamin Franklin with Paine cannot rightly be overlooked.  Franklin too was an inventor and, by virtue of
discovering the polarity of electricity, one of only three native American discoverers of laws of nature known to me.(20) It is implausible that merely by accident
Franklin, having been introduced to Paine by one of the latter's fellow mathematicians in his native England, understood Paine's genius as a fellow product of the
Newtonian revolution and arranged for him to live and work in England's colonies.  As far as I have been able to determine, the Declaration of Independence may have
been as much or more the work of Franklin, Jefferson, and the latter's committee members as Paine's, but Paine's ideas are reflected in it.(21)

As evidence, consider Paine's leading role in producing a preamble to the French Constitution, *The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens adopted by the
National Assembly of France*  and containing these declared rights (DRs) among others that echo the sentiments of Paine expressed in *Rights of Man*:
DR 2: "The end of all Political associations is the Preservation of the Natural and Imprescriptible Rights of Man; and these rights are Liberty, Property, Security,
and Resistance of Oppression."(22)
DR 4: "Political Liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not Injure another. The exercise of the Natural Rights of every Man, has no other limits than
those which are necessary to secure to every other Man the Free exercise of the same Rights; and these limits are determinable only by the Law."
DR 5: "The Law ought to Prohibit only actions hurtful to Society. What is not Prohibited by the Law should not be hindered; nor should anyone be compelled to that
which the Law does not Require."
DR 12: "A Public force being necessary to give security to the Rights of Men and of Citizens, that force is instituted for the benefit of the Community and not for
the particular benefit of the persons to whom it is intrusted."  It is noteworthy that the behavior of public officials in the United States has not even risen to
the height of the bar that Paine raised for France in DR12.

In Paine's writings I find an internally consistent blend of classical liberalism with what now is called capitalism. His civic philosophy synthesizes property and
the flow of rewards to achievers with the idea of social insurance for all.  In 1967, the term "capitalism" assumed its modern meaning by being defined simply as "a
social system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights, in which all property is privately owned".(23)   An assumption built into this
definition is: control of property is never, under no circumstances, separated from ownership. Paine noted; "There are two kinds of property. Firstly, natural
property, ... such as the earth, air, water. Secondly, ... acquired property -- the invention of men",(24)  the latter being acquired by contract.

In the commercial arena, Paine opposed intervention by a foreign monarch and domestic interference with the development of robust monetary foundations as exemplied
by the Coinage Act of 1792.  Paine "was trying to free commercial relations from a type of oligarchy. It developed into capitalism, and the forces aligning against
monarchy have their root in a nascent capitalism."(25)

Independently of that endeavor, Paine was faithful to what would later come to be known as capitalism.  Case in point: "In 'Agrarian Justice,' he developed the first
realistic proposal in the world to abolish systematic poverty: a universal social insurance system comprising old-age pensions and disability support and universal
stakeholder grants for young adults, funded by a 10% inheritance tax focused on land."(26) Lest this be wrongly seen as a redistribution of property, to see otherwise
consider Paine's argument for the proposal.  Passing over some of his preliminary argument, I bring you to these two postulations: (1) "[T]he first principle of
civilization ought to have been, and ought still to be, that the condition of every person born into the world, after a state of civilization commences, ought not
to be worse than if he had been born before that period. ... (2) "the earth in its natural, uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the common
property of the human race.  In that state, every man would have been born into property." Ultimately his argument culminates in: "Every proprietor of cultivated
lands owes to the community a ground-rent ... for the land which he holds".(27) Here he explains why, given principles (1) and (2), cultivators of large land parcels
owe a percentage rent to be collected as a tax. By this argument, Paine demonstrates the absence of expropriation or what might otherwise be seen as
anti-capitalistic intent in his "social insurance".

To complete Paine's mission, among other actions that can be taken are:
1.  ... to restore his legacy. History has denied Paine proper gratitude for inventing the United States. Athens, after exiling its great general Themistocles who
had saved the country from Persian invaders, and after forcing on its great philosopher Socrates a choice of exile or a cup of hemlock, fell into decline and never
recovered. Similarly, the United States, nearly oblivious to its inventor, has been in decline as measured by the Index of Economic Freedom and other metrics.
2. ... to hold officials to their oath of office,(28)  to remove the slavery of fiat currency inflation, consistently with Paine's advocacy of the death penalty for
those who would move for legal tender laws(29) and to free commerce from the imposition of trade restrictions and taxation without consent of the people.
3. ... to develop organizational dynamics. The design (and re-engineering) of a nation is a work of organizational dynamics, not to be confused with what is casually
and tenuously called "organizational dynamics" in universities today. Tesla articulated a qualitative concept of directed human motion affected by rational planning
and by innovation; his phrase "which we are not yet able to compute" suggested that he thought it could ultimately be quantified.  Kurt Lewin aimed at defining a
topological space suitable to represent social interaction. Until their successor(s) in organizational dynamics anchor that discipline in Galilean physical dynamics,
inadequate theoretical grounding will exist for fortifying the American Revolution.  That is an aim of my ongoing current research.(30)

Additionally, patriots can presently support scholarly research on Paine's legacy by donating to organizations of their choice, such as The Thomas Paine National
Historical Association in New Rochelle.  This litany is incomplete and enumerates only those fulfilling actions of which I have conceived independently of a
forthcoming work which would be far more complete. It is my hope and expectation that Rad Freeman's work will receive serious attention by scholars.(31)

From those who have raised their voices above their faculties to claim through ignorance of inconvenient facts that our country was founded entirely on oppression,
it would be refreshing to hear or read an explanation why they have been so silent about the inventor of the United States having been a consistent foe of slavery,
both physical and mental, and an uncompromising promoter of human happiness.  Where is the recognition and gratitude for this man Paine who endured severe risks and
hardships, devoting his life to the elimination of all forms of oppression in at least two countries and worldwide through his writings?

Dear reader, sursum corda! Is it necessary or prudent to attack a revolution on account of some darkness in its history? A revolution is a human endeavor that
embraces some mistakes and some darkness, as when revolving about the sun our planet is eclipsed by the moon.  The leading revolutionary of the United States has
written: "The sun needs no inscription to distinguish him from darkness; and no sooner did the American governments display themselves to the world, than despotism
felt a shock and man began to contemplate redress."(32) For a limited time, an option exists to sustain the shock to despotism.  Might we honor the brilliance in the
revolution's history and intent by completing and fulfilling it?

What darkness can anyone find that was in Paine's blueprint for this country?  Can you find any? Gratitude to the inventor means more than words.  It means action
that would culminate in the application of inventor Thomas Paine's principles that were provably morally correct. A revolution is not a rebellion; these two are
geometrically and consequentially different. From Galileo's physical demonstrations of the Copernican/Keplerian planetary arrangement, we learn that Earth is a
planet that spirals around the sun in an elliptical-helical orbit, climbing against gravity and never leaving that source of light.  The spiralling is, in its
cycle, a revolution, and the consequence is not only light but also life; a social revolution would climb toward both.  By contrast, a rebellion is a destructive
social movement that may produce death or removal of persons or organizations, replacing some actors with other actors; its consequences are events of a type that
includes coup d'&eacute;tat and/or insurrection. It solves nothing. It is a zig-zag kind of motion not climbing to light but yielding the darkness in continuing loss of
liberty.

What is the liberty at which Paine's revolution has been aimed? In the absence of full development of this subtopic, we can provisionally define liberty as the free
exercise of property rights.  Because you own your life as a natural right and have a natural right to liberty, no external source is required for these rights.
Naturally, you also have a right to what you produce, including your ideas, and the non-intellectual productions of others that you acquire ethically by contract.
There is no protection for these rights until there has been a full revolution. The revolution spirals away from any darkness of the founding to embrace the light
in Paine's invention of a nation. The revolution requires construction not destruction.

These are again "times that try men's souls", new times and dark times, yet times that have been nurtured by a supreme exemplar of converting inner passions to
patriotic action.(33)  Can you sense the ongoing presence of Paine in the United States? In the days after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the USA, I personally heard
in the U.S. media -- and even in advertising -- this passage from Paine's Crisis Papers but without crediting him: "THESE are the times that try men's souls.
The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks
of man and woman".  Thomas Paine did not stop at inventing the United States but left us guidance toward completing the invention.  Action now to fortify and finish
his work can pay down the price of the freedom that he bequeathed us.

take the first step into a thousand years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's children say of us we justified our brief moment
here. We did all that could be done."
