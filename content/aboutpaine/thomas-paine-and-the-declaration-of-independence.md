   by Gary Berton

   former President of TPNHA

    

   Van Buren Denslow, in his book on the great thinkers of western
   civilization, said of Thomas Paine: "If a set of opinions could be
   entitled to a place among political philosophers by reasons of millions
   having come to believe in and praise them, then indeed Paine would stand,
   more than any other, as the founder of the American school of political
   philosophy, as he certainly is the founder of the creed of American
   democracy".1 This creed was formulated in Common Sense, that great
   declaration of independence - independence not only from a foreign power,
   but integral to that, from the hereditary transmission of political power.
   To accomplish this independence, Paine laid out the system of democratic
   republicanism for an oppressed world.

   Viciously attacked from the first printing by the entrenched economic and
   political powers, both in London and in the American colonies, Common
   Sense still emerged as the great political manifesto of the 18th century.
   It marked the beginning of the era of democratic revolutions, providing
   its rationale and philosophy, and opening up to the masses of the
   disenfranchised people the world of political participation. In fact, it
   was Paine who later introduced democracy (literally) as a positive term
   and concept to the modern era.2 This era continues today.

   And so do these same attacks. These attacks first came from the landed and
   wealthy American aristocracy who saw in Common Sense a democratic threat
   to their power. These aristocrats (and their admirers like John Adams)
   created an American myth of the founding, a myth that put the most
   conservative wing at the center of importance and marginalized and
   distorted the contributions of the true radicals. "The history of American
   radicalism has long been buried or blurred by a liberal-conservative
   consensus".3 This conservative view of history is responsible more than
   anything else for the 200 years of attack and slander on Thomas Paine.

   While Common Sense's essential role of turning the country towards
   independence is acknowledged in the prevailing catechism of the Federalist
   interpretation of history its political philosophy is ignored or
   ridiculed. I call this catechism "Federalist" because the opposition to
   Paine and his philosophy was centered in the Federalist camp and the
   Federalist leaders are given the primary role in the founding of the
   country by this liberal-conservative consensus. This skewed version of
   history is best seen in the denial of the role Common Sense played in the
   creation of the Declaration of Independence. Pauline Maier in her book
   American Scriptures4, goes to great lengths to marginalize Common Sense
   and attack its significance. Maier, who greatly admires John Adams,
   accepts without question his every utterance, and she also adopts his
   prejudices. Like Adams, she appears to be obsessed with Paine and can't
   understand how "History is to ascribe the American Revolution to Thomas
   Paine".5

   Common Sense has been marginalized and attacked for its unswerving
   insistence on real democracy as essential to the founding of this country.
   As Richard Rosenfeld says:

   "Tom Paine urges freedom from Britain to secure American democracy, to
   achieve freedom and equality for every citizen. Freedom from Britain
   (independence), freedom of trade or property (free enterprise), the
   freedom of English subjects ("ordered liberty"), and the freedom of 
   democracy (equality) are different "freedoms," and Common Sense urges
   democratic freedom as the basis for an American Revolution."6

   This democratic basis of the American Revolution is what made Federalist
   John Adams choke on Common Sense, and consequently makes Maier choke as
   well. But even using Maier's facts, an objective mind cannot fail to see
   how Common Sense gave birth to the Declaration of Independence.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   There are two approaches which will demonstrate this fact - one
   historical, one analytical.

   Historically, before Common Sense no one dared speak of independence
   publicly. As Paine noted at the time in Crisis III, "Independence was a
   doctrine scarce and rare, even towards the conclusion of the year 1775..."
   It was merely whispered in parlor rooms, and more often denounced as
   traitorous. Common Sense had the effect of producing an "almost unrivaled
   political somersault"7 in transforming the attitudes in America. As
   Washington said, it was "working a powerful change ...in the minds of many
   men"8, not only for independence from Britain, but independence from
   monarchy. Gordon Wood points out a sudden and almost complete revolution
   in thinking towards republicanism taking place in the attitudes of the
   Americans in the spring of 1776.9

   As Hazelton10 and Burnett11 have shown, most of the old leaders who were
   in the Congress during the war rewrote their own history after the fact to
   fit with the myths that had been created. They scurried to lay claim on
   the heritage of the Declaration. Some of their memoirs contain boasts
   exclaiming how they supported independence before Common Sense appeared,
   but a quick read of what they were saying at the time refutes that. No one
   but Paine had the courage to stand up and proclaim it, and then to defend
   it in a tour de force of prose. One after another "founding father" took
   an opposite view of independence until Common Sense appeared.

   Despite John Adams' protestations to the contrary, he never stood up and
   defended the necessity for independence before the appearance of Common
   Sense. His claim that independence was repeatedly discussed in Congress
   before Common Sense is his attempt to minimize Paine's role. His dismissal
   of Common Sense in his memoirs as trite would be just sad if it weren't
   for Pauline Maier's use of this quote to "prove" that Common Sense should
   be marginalized.12 She even concludes from this lone quote that Congress
   "was already moving apace toward Independence".13  Her attempts to
   establish Adams as the focus of all activity and wisdom requires that
   Paine be pushed aside, and therefore she must lay doubt on the political
   somersault Common Sense caused.

   Maier's own facts contradict her conclusion: "But throughout 1775 every
   Congressional petition, address or declaration...sought a settlement of
   their differences with the Mother Country not Independence".14 And, "Even
   the most radical members of Congress professed a strong preference for
   remaining in the empire".15 And she observes that even by June of l776,
   the delegates "lagged behind" the people in regards to independence.16
   Maier's conclusion that therefore Congress was already moving apace
   towards independence is contradicted by facts she herself supplies.

   And Adams himself testifies to the importance of Common Sense in a letter
   in April, 1776: "...Common Sense , like a ray of revelation, has come in
   seasonably to clear our doubts, and to fix our choice".17 Adams' objection
   to Common Sense was not its call for independence, but rather its
   democratic foundation. Adams complains of Paine: "His plan is so
   democratical".18 Adams knew full well the impact of Common Sense on the
   rapid shift towards independence, and expressed it repeatedly. His hatred
   for Paine, who he called the "disastrous meteor"19 of democracy, clouded
   his account of the period. It would seem that Maier falls under the same
   prejudice.

   Others of the time support Adams' opinion of the importance of Common
   Sense in producing an about-face in the attitude toward independence. From
   a Bostonian on the impact of Common Sense, "Independence a year ago could
   not have been publickly mentioned with impunity. Nothing else is now
   talked of, and I know not what can be done by Great Britain to prevent
   it".20 In Maryland a letter to a newspaper said, "If you know the author
   of Common Sense tell him he has done wonders and worked miracles, made
   Tories Whigs and washed blackmoors white. He has made a great number of
   converts here".21 And in South Carolina, after denouncing Gadsden for
   introducing a call for independence in February, having been one of the
   few to read Common Sense by then, the Assembly turned an about face and
   issued its Declaration in April after Common Sense had been circulated
   there.22 A similar account took place in the New York Assembly.23

   Perhaps the best summation of the role Common Sense played is given by an
   Englishman, Sir George Trevelyan, in the 19th century:

   "It would be difficult to name any human composition which has had an
   effect at once so instant, so extended and so lasting...It was pirated,
   parodied and imitated, and translated into the language of every country
   where the new republic had well-wishers...According to contemporary
   newspapers Common Sense turned thousands to independence who before could
   not endure the thought. It worked nothing short of miracles and turned
   Tories into Whigs."24

   Despite Maier's animosity towards Paine, and repeated attempts to minimize
   his role, she cannot hide certain historical facts. For example, she shows
   how in the spring of 1776, from April to July, some 90 Declarations of
   Independence were spontaneously produced by towns, counties, cities and
   states. Her conclusion is that this is proof that the minds of the people
   were moving towards independence. She fails to state the obvious and fails
   to link the appearance of Common Sense as the cause of this effect.
   Certainly Paine was not writing in a vacuum, and he drew on the sentiments
   and potential among the people. But Maier's ignoring Common Sense as a
   prime factor demonstrates prejudice overcoming sound professional
   judgment.

   Even a cursory look at the content of these Declarations shows the
   underlying influence of Paine's work. The first recurring theme in them is
   condemning the King. From Maryland: "..the King of Great Britain has
   violated his compact with this people, and that they owe no allegiance to
   him".25 "America may become a free and independent state" is another
   typical theme.26 In Massachusetts they condemned an unfeeling king, and
   Virginia even uses "Tis time to part".27 Does Maier say these are isolated
   cases, and that a few might have used some language from Common Sense? No,
   just the opposite: "the contents of the various state and local
   resolutions on Independence are virtually identical".28  And: "What they
   said was, however, everywhere remarkably alike".29 What force of words
   existed in early 1776 to create such a phenomenon? To anyone but Maier the
   answer is plain - Common Sense.

   Here is where Maier makes her second error. Given all the weight of the
   evidence, how could she marginalize Common Sense?  Like this: referring to
   all these Declarations she says, "The case was tightly argued and
   essentially convincing. It was not, however, the argument of Thomas
   Paine".30 She says Paine attacked monarchy, but the Declarations did not,
   therefore Paine's influence was marginal. According to Maier, Paine merely
   provoked debate, and thereafter the argument for separation turned on what
   the Mother country did.31 But what had Britain done between January and
   April to cause the fury of Declarations? She has no answer. And whatever
   occurrences of British tyranny existed would be magnified in the wake of
   Common Sense. These tyrannies had been going on for 12 years, why would
   they become suddenly so horrific? Weren't the oppressive acts of the
   previous years more egregious? Only the radical call to revolution in
   Thomas Paine's Common Sense could turn these disputes into a cry for
   Independence.

   The obvious explanation for not condemning the monarchial system in the
   Declarations is that they were not the proper forum. Even Paine, in his
   outline of the Declaration in Common Sense, leaves no room for an attack
   on monarchy. That is the political philosophy behind writing the
   Declaration, but not its content. It was the fuel, not the fire; the cause
   not the effect. But the several attacks on the King in these 90
   Declarations, attacks which never existed to any scale before Common
   Sense, demonstrate Paine's influence. The separation would produce an
   independent sovereignty, and it was a separation with Britain AND their
   system that pervades every Declaration.

   The conservative wing of the Americans who supported separation but feared
   democracy have always made the case (even back then) to leave the door
   open for a new monarchy. Adams, Maier's hero, was the leader in this
   agitation, as shown when he wrote: "What do you mean ...by Republican
   systems? . . . You seem determined not to allow a limited monarchy to be a
   republican system, which it certainly is, and the best that has ever been
   tried. . ."32  Separating Common Sense into a useful Independence pamphlet
   and a "disastrous meteor", "so democratical", was Adams' way of
   diminishing Paine's importance, and keeping monarchy alive. Unlike Adams,
   Paine stood for a democratic republic, and the two sides have still not
   reconciled, nor should they.

    

   Now let us examine the analytical criteria for determining the role Common
   Sense played in the creation of the Declaration of Independence. To do
   that we need to see that all of Common Sense, when read cover to cover,
   leads up to the conclusion of declaring Independence.  In fact Paine
   emphasized the importance of this in his Crisis 13:

   "The cause of America made me an author. The force with which it struck my
   mind, and the dangerous condition the country appeared to me in, by
   courting an impossible and an unnatural reconciliation with those who were
   determined to reduce her, instead of striking out into the only line that
   could cement and save her, A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, made it
   impossible for me, feeling as I did, to be silent..."33

   Paine concludes Common Sense with "nothing can settle our affairs so
   expeditiously as an open and determined declaration for independence"34
   followed by four reasons. The first three formed the basis for much of the
   content of the arguments in favor of declarations of independence
   throughout America: no state could intervene as mediator, no assistance
   could be made, and foreign nations view us as only rebels without a
   declaration of independence. The fourth point reads:

   "Were a manifesto to be published, and despatched to foreign courts,
   setting forth the miseries we have endured, and the peaceful methods which
   we have ineffectually used for redress; declaring at the same time, that
   not being able any longer to live happily or safely under the cruel
   disposition of the British court, we had been driven to the necessity of
   breaking off all connections with her; at the same time, assuring all such
   Courts of our peaceable disposition towards them, and of our desire of
   entering into trade with them; such a memorial would produce more good
   effects to this continent, than if a ship were freighted with petitions to
   Britain."35

   If we now look at the Declaration of Independence we see essentially six
   sections, being: introduction, the foundation for a bill of rights, a list
   of charges against the King(the bulk of the document), peaceful methods of
   redress, the necessity of separation, and the benefits of an independent
   state. Paine's paragraph above outlines the last four sections of the
   Declaration of Independence. And it does so in the same order, using the
   same terminology. Quite a coincidence for a publication which only sparked
   a debate and did not share the arguments of the Declarations! This should
   lead any honest scholar of the Declaration to at least mention this
   paragraph, even if only to discredit it. Maier spends hundreds of pages
   documenting all the links to the Declaration, but has no room for this
   one. It is because this is the smoking gun, the part of Common Sense that
   obviously greatly influenced the author of the Declaration of
   Independence, directly or indirectly.

   To be thorough let's compare the Declaration text to the above paragraph
   from Common Sense. "The miseries we have endured" is plain enough: the end
   of the second paragraph of the Declaration says "The history of his
   present majesty, is a history of unremitting injuries and usurpations,
   among which no one fact stands single or solitary to contradict the
   uniform tenor of the rest...", followed by the long list of grievances
   endured.

   "The peaceful methods which we have ineffectually used for redress" is
   reflected in the Declaration in the third to last paragraph(immediately
   after the end of the grievance list): "In every stage of these oppressions
   we have petitioned for redress, in the most humble terms; our repeated
   petitions have been answered by repeated injuries."

   "We have been driven to the necessity of breaking off all connections with
   her" from the above quote from Common Sense is mirrored in the Declaration
   in the second to last paragraph: after a recounting of the "common" ties
   to be renounced forever it says "The road to happiness and to glory is
   open to us too; we will climb it, apart from them, and acquiesce in the
   necessity which denounces our eternal separation."

   And lastly, the phrase "assuring all such Courts of our peaceable
   disposition towards them, ... would produce more good effects to this
   continent, than if a ship were freighted with petitions to Britain" is
   reflected in the last paragraph of the declaration, "...as free and
   independent states they shall hereafter have power to levy war, conclude
   peace, contract alliances, establish commerce,..." etc.

   But there is more. In Maier's analysis of Jefferson's Declaration, she
   omits these last three sections for discussion. Why? If you read her book,
   you would think the Declaration consisted of the introduction, the bill of
   rights and the list of grievances alone.

   There is even more content correspondence between the Declaration and
   Common Sense. The political philosophy of Thomas Paine reflected in Common
   Sense is evident throughout the central themes of the Declaration. "All
   men are created equal", for example, is not unique to Paine in this era.
   But its application to the principles of government identical to both
   Common Sense and the Declaration are unique to this time. To point out
   that these principles appear in some other Declarations in the spring of
   1776 simply reinforces the link. "Mankind being originally equals in the
   order of creation, the equality could not be destroyed by some subsequent
   circumstance.. ." from Common Sense is one of the most profound and
   revolutionary principles of Paine, one which seeped into the subconscious
   of the American people. When the Declaration says, "To secure these
   rights, governments are instituted among men.", it echoes Common Sense's
   thesis on the design and end of government.

   Even smaller concepts like "he is now exciting those very people <slaves>
   to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has
   deprived them" from the Declaration is unique to Common Sense in origin.
   Uses of words such as "common blood", "common king" and "common kindred"
   in the Declaration is a concept introduced by Paine in Common Sense, where
   he never speaks of a mother country or parent country but always America
   and Britain as equals. Or compare, "These facts have given the last stab
   to agonizing affection, and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these
   unfeeling brethren" to similar sentiments in Common Sense such as "our
   affections wounded", and "forever renounce a power in whom we have no
   trust". And where else does the unique concept of labeling the King a
   "tyrant" come from except Common Sense - a term Adams took exception to in
   both documents.36   Even the phrase and concept "free and independent
   states" is at the end of both documents(the added appendix in Common
   Sense.

   Upon examination, therefore, it becomes evident that the concepts and
   language of Common Sense pervade not only the 90 Declarations written in
   the spring of I776, and not only the dialogue in newspapers, journals,
   assemblies and taverns of the period, but also the national Declaration of
   Independence itself.

   Far more than a treatise that stirred debate, more than the best selling
   piece of literature of the era, and more than a rallying cry for
   independence - Common Sense laid the groundwork for the official founding
   document of this country. All the principles of democratic republicanism
   and a government of laws based on a popular constitution are found in the
   unofficial founding document - Common Sense. It ushered in the epoch of
   democracy for the world, skillfully presented in sound and convincing
   arguments, and opened up a struggle to secure its aims that continues to
   this day. It was the manifesto of the American school of political
   philosophy, and the founding document of American democracy from which
   subsequent documents, from the Declaration of Independence, to the
   Gettysburg Address, to the Civil Rights laws of the 1960's have their
   roots.
