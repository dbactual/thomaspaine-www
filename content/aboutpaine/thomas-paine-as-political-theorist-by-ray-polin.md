   Some Observations on Thomas Paine's Birthday Celebration, January 29, 2000
   at the Memorial Building of TPNHA
    
   Following Director Brian McCartin's apt statement about the life and
   character of Thomas Paine, we preface our own remarks with the observation
   that Thomas Paine strongly believed that political power had to be
   limited. A good constitution and good laws can therefore serve to help
   tell us what should be the extent of a government's powers and what a
   person's rights and duties are-that is, so far as the people are
   reasonably able to determine and consent to.
    
   We should also see that Paine was not just an active foe of tyranny,
   monarchy, and slavery. Paine was a uniquely eloquent and persuasive
   advocate of a democratic republic and of an informed, enlightened
   citizenry. Indeed, he proudly called himself Citizen Paine and would have
   no subjects of any monarch!
    
   It is appropriate, therefore, that we citizens of America should
   gather here today to honor Paine's memory his ideas, and his contribution
   on the date of his birthday on January 29, 1737. Next, it is well that we
   grasp what Thomas Paine's essential historical role was. It was twofold.
   It was, first of all, as a visionary who gave us sharper understanding of
   certain fundamental truths; and secondly, it was as a catalyst who stirred
   countless others also to act, to carry these truths to realization "out in
   the real world." He showed Americans and others paths they should follow
   to fulfill their legitimate aspirations and destiny.
    
   Among the important political principles Paine clarified was the also
   two-fold one that individuals could not be securely free unless, to begin
   with, externally they were inhabitants of an independent country that made
   and enforced its own laws; and secondly, unless internally they also had
   above them no monarchy or class of nobles that could negate or interfere
   with such popular government (Abraham Lincoln's government of the people,
   by the people, and for the people).
    
   In short, Paine's historical role was first to help America win
   independence from Great Britain, and then to set up a democratic,
   republican form of government: that is, one that has no monarchy or
   nobility. In a res publica (a thing of the people), the people are not the
   property of a king or nobleman: instead the government belongs to the
   people.
    
   Independence of an individual or of a nation requires maturity and
   self reliance, not dependence and submission to parental or political
   authority. There comes a time, a coming of age, to cut the silver chord.
   Those who play it safe and fail to become self reliant, lack maturity as
   an individual or as a nation. They lack what Cicero, Machiavelli, Paine,
   and Jefferson would have called virtue (virtu) in its original sense:
   namely the manly, adult quality of the proud, rambunctious kind that an
   American frontiersman exemplified, because he could look anyone in the
   eye, and not shrink from a fight if offended or challenged. It comes from
   the Latin word for a grown male, vir, because he had developed
   virtue-qualities of responsibility, courage, honor, and self reliance (in
   contradistinction to qualities allowed an immature child, or supposedly
   more delicate, vulnerable, and dependent woman). Paine was consciously
   virtuous in this old fashioned way in word and deed.
    
   Paine should therefore be recognized as a brave and perceptively
   wise political theorist and activist, because of the way he hastened
   historical development toward independence, freedom, equality, justice,
   and fraternity within democratic republican forms of government in America
   and elsewhere.
    
   There is another aspect of Thomas Paine's corpus of political
   writings that should also be noted here today. If political theory applies
   to stated principles that have frequent applicability to basic problems of
   government, and especially if they gain wide, continuing acceptance, then
   Thomas Paine is entitled to be recognized and respected as a political
   theorist of stature.
    
   Not only was Paine an influential voice in his own day, but also many
   of his ideas continue to stand the test of time and to show their
   prophetic value. As he has for two centuries past, Paine remains relevant
   today because of his universal, global view of the human race, and its
   problems and how to deal with them. He emphasizes fundamental similarities
   and the need for warm fraternity among all mankind, not our superficial
   and transient differences. Paine's message is a declamation of freedom,
   equality, and active justice for all of mankind that is purposed to unite
   it in a peaceful, caring brotherhood. Its realization would be fulfillment
   of his passionately held and expressed deistic-quaker impulses and
   convictions that may be characterized as -- all at once -- religious,
   rational, and Romantic. Where he erred was in supposing all republics to
   be inherently more peaceable.
    
   As does every Romantic, Paine means to rouse the emotions; but unlike
   many a Romantic, he means to stir us to accept and act primarily upon
   rational principles and historic evidence. Paine does not represent simply
   a transition between politico-religious and politico-economic theory: he
   combines them. Also, Paine does not represent simply a transition between
   the Age of Reason and Romanticism: he combines them in his vision of an
   efficiently functioning semi-utopian society based on justice, science,
   and loving concern for one another that he propounds with reason and
   enthusiasm.
