   Paine never signed his name "Tom" Paine. He always used Thomas. "Tom" 
   was  invented by  his detractors, and they were the only ones who used it
   in the beginning.  "Tom" came from the attacks and slanders by his enemies
   (the churches and the monarchists and some of the Federalists) as a way to
   demean him as a commoner.  They usually linked "Tom" with another attempt
   at slander like "corset maker" which were designed for the same purpose -
   to demean him since they had no arguments to refute him.  So we prefer
   Thomas to "Tom" because of that.  However, many populist groups like to
   use "Tom" because it implies ties to the common man, which he had. So
   depending on the source and context, either one is fine. But remember, did
   anyone ever see Adams referred to as "Jack" Adams, or was there an "Al"
   Hamilton, or "Tom" Jefferson? Historians should show the same respect for
   Paine and use "Thomas".
