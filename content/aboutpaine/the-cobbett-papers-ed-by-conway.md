                               THE COBBETT PAPERS

   In the autumn of 1792, William Cobbett arrived in America. Among the
   papers preserved by the family of Thomas Jefferson is a letter from
   Cobbett, enclosing an introduction from Mr. Short, U. S. Secretary of
   Legation at Paris. In this letter, dated at Wilmington, Delaware, November
   2, 1792, the young Englishman writes: "Ambitious to become the citizen of
   a free state I have left my native country, England, for America. I bring
   with me youth, a small family, a few useful literary talents, and that is
   all."

   Cobbett had been married in the same year, on February 5th, and visited
   Paris, perhaps with an intention of remaining, but becoming disgusted with
   the revolution he left for America. He had conceived a dislike of the
   French revolutionary leaders, among whom he included Paine. He thus became
   an easy victim of the libellous Life of Paine, by George Chalmers, which
   had not been reprinted in America, and reproduced the statements of that
   work in a brief biographical sketch pulished in Philadelphia, 1796. In
   later life Cobbett became convinced that he had been deceived into giving
   fresh currency to a tissue of slanders.

   In the very year of this publication, afterwards much lamented, Paine
   published in Europe a work, that filled Cobbett with admiration. This
   was "The Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance," which
   predicted the suspension of gold payments by the Bank of England that
   followed the next year. The pamphlet became Cobbett's text-book, and
   his Register was eloquent in Paine's praise, the more earnestly, he
   confessed, because he had "been one of his most violent assailants." 

   "Old age having laid his hand upon this truly great man, this truly
   philosophical politician, at his expiring flambeau I lighted my taper."

   A sketch of Thomas Paine and some relate papers of Cobbett are generously
   confided to me by his daughter, Eleanor Cobbett, through he nephew,
   William Cobbett, Jr., of Woodlands, near Manchester, England. The public
   announcement (1818) by Cobbett, then in America, of his intention to write
   a Life of Paine , led to his negotiation with Madame Bonneville, who, with
   her husband, resided in New York. Madame Bonneville had been disposing of
   some of Paine's manuscripts, such as that on"Freemasonry," and the reply
   to Bishop Watson, printed in The Theophilanthropist (1810). She had also
   been preparing, with her husband's assistance, notes for a biography of
   Paine, because of the "unjust efforts to tarnish the memory of Mr. Paine";
   adding, "Et l'indignation m'a fait prendre la plume." ["And the
   indignation made me take the feather." -- Digital Editor's Translation.]
   Cobbett agreed to give her a thousand dollars for the manuscript, which
   was to contain important letters from and to eminent men. She stated
   (September 30, 1819) her conditions, that it should be published in
   England, without any addition, and separate from any other writings. I
   suppose it was one or all of these conditions that caused the
   non-completion of the bargain. Cobbett re-wrote the whole thing, and it is
   now all in his writing except a few passages by Madame Bonneville, which I
   indicate by brackets, and two or three by his son, J. P. Cobbett. Although
   Madame Bonneville gave some revision to Cobbett's manuscript, most of the
   letters to be supplied are merely indicated. No trace of them exists among
   the Cobbett papers. Soon afterward the Bonnevilles went to Paris, where
   they kept a small book shop. Nicolas died in 1828. His biography in
   Michaud's Dictionary is annotated by the widow, and states that in 1829
   she had begun to edit for publication the Life and posthumous papers of
   Thomas Paine. From this it would appear that she had retained the
   manuscript, and the original letters. In 1833 Madame Bonneville emigrated
   to St. Louis, where her son, the late General Bonneville, lived. Her
   Catholicism became, I believe, devout with advancing years, and to that
   cause, probably also to a fear of reviving the old scandal Cheetham had
   raised, may be due the suppression of the papers, with the result
   mentioned in the introduction to this work. She died in St. Louis, October
   30, 1846, at the age of 79. Probably William Cobbett did not feel entitled
   to publish the manuscript obtained under such conditions, or he might have
   waited for the important documents that were never sent. He died in 1835,

   The recollections are those of both M. and Madame Bonneville. The reader
   will find no difficulty in making out the parts that represent Madame's
   personal knowledge and reminiscences, as Cobbett has preserved her speech
   in the first person, and, with characteristic literary acumen, her
   expressions in such important points. His manuscript is perfect, and I
   have little editing to do beyond occasional correction of a date,
   supplying one or two letters indicated, which I have found, and omitting a
   few letters, extracts, etc., already printed in the body of this work,
   where unaccompanied by any comment or addition from either Cobbett or the
   Bonnevilles.

   At the time when this Cobbett-Bonneville sketch was written New York was
   still a provincial place. Nicolas, Bonneville, as Irving describes him,
   seated under trees at the Battery, absorbed in his classics, might have
   been regarded with suspicion had it been known that his long separation
   from his family was due to detention by the police. Madame Bonneville is
   reserved on that point. The following incident, besides illustrating the
   characters of Paine and Bonneville, may suggest a cause for the rigor of
   Bonneville's surveillance. In 1797, while Paine and Bonneville were
   editing the Bien Informe, a "suspect" sought asylum with them. This was
   Count Barruel-Beauvert, an author whose writings alone had caused his
   denunciation as a royalist. He had escaped from the Terror, and now
   wandered back in disguise, a pauper Count, who knew well the magnanimity
   of the two men whose protection he asked. He remained, as proof-reader, in
   the Bonneville house for some time, safely; but when the conspiracy of 18
   Fructidor (September 4, 1797) exasperated the Republic against royalists,
   the Count feared that he might be the means of compromising his
   benefactors, and disappeared. When the royalist conspiracy against
   Bonaparte was discovered, Barruel-Beauvert was again hunted, and arrested
   (1802). His trial probably brought to the knowledge of the police his
   former sojourn with Paine and Bonneville. Bonaparte sent by Fouche a
   warning to Paine that the eye of the police was upon him, and that "on the
   first complaint he would be sent to his own country, America." Whether
   this, and the closer surveillance on Bonneville, were connected with the
   Count, who also suffered for a time, or whether due to their antislavery
   writings on Domingo, remains conjectural. Towards the close of life
   Bonneville received a pension, which was continued to his widow. So much
   even a monarchy with an established church could do for a republican
   author, and a freethinker; for Bonneville had published heresies like
   those of Paine.

                      A SKETCH OF HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER.

   [More exactly than any other author Thomas Paine delineates every
   Circumstantial Events, private or Public in his Writings; nevertheless,
   since many pretended Histories of the Life of T. P. have been published,
   tracing him back to the day of his]1 birth, we shall shortly observe,
   that, as was never denied by himself, he was born at Thetford, in the
   County of Norfolk, England on the 29 January, in the year 1737; that his
   father Joseph Paine was a stay-maker, and by religion a Quaker; that his
   mother was the daughter of a country-attorney, and that she belonged to
   the Church of England; but, it appears, that she also afterwards became a
   Quaker; for these parents both belonged to the Meeting in 1787, as appears
   from a letter of the father to the son. The abovementioned histories
   relate (and the correctness of the statement has not been denied by him),
   that Paine was educated at the free-school of Thetford; that he left it in
   1752, when he was fifteen years of age, and then worked for some time with
   his father: that in a year afterwards, he went to London: that from London
   he went to Dover: that about this time he was on the eve of becoming a
   sailor: that he afterwards did embark on board a privateer: that, between
   the years 1759 and 1774 he was a staymaker, an excise officer, a grocer,
   and an usher to a school; and that, during the period he was twice
   married, and separated by mutual consent, from his second wife.2

   In this year 1774 and in the month of September, Paine sailed from England
   for Philadelphia, where he arrived safe; and now we begin his history; for
   here we have him in connection with his literary labours.

   It being an essential part of our plan to let Thomas Paine speak in his
   own words, and explain himself the reason for his actions, whenever we
   find written papers in his own hand, though in incomplete notes or
   fragments, we shall insert such, in order to enable the reader to judge
   for himself, and to estimate the slightest circumstances. Souvent d'un
   grand dessin un mot nous fait juger. "A word often enables us to judge of
   a great design."

   "I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of
   hostilities. I found the disposition of the people such that they might
   have been led by a thread and governed by a reed. Their suspicion was
   quick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate, and
   it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it. They disliked
   the Ministry, but they esteemed the Nation. Their idea of grievance
   operated without resentment, and their single object was reconciliation.
   Bad as I believed the Ministry to be, I never conceived them capable of a
   measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of hostilities; much less did
   I imagine the Nation would encourage it. I viewed the dispute as a kind of
   law-suit, in which I supposed the parties would find a way either to
   decide or settle it. I had no thoughts of independence or of arms. The
   world could not then have persuaded me that I should be either a soldier
   or an author. If I had any talents for either they were buried in me, and
   might ever have continued so had not the necessity of the times dragged
   and driven them into action. I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving
   myself happy wished everybody else so. But when the country, into which I
   had just set my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir.
   It was time for every man to stir."3

   His first intention at Philadelphia was to establish an Academy for young
   ladies, who were to be taught many branches of learning then little known
   in the education of young American ladies. But, in 1775, he undertook the
   management of the Pennsylvania Magazine.

   About this time he published, in Bradford's journal, an essay on the
   slavery of the negroes, which was universally well received; and also
   stanzas on the death of General Wolfe.

   In 1776, January 10, be published Common Sense. In the same year he joined
   the army as aid-de-camp to General Greene. Gordon, in his history of
   the Independence of the United States (vol. ii. p.78), says: [Wantiing.]
   -- Ramsay (Lond. ed. i. p.336) says: [Wanting.]   Anecdote of Dr. Franklin
   preserved by Thomas Paine: [Wanting, but no doubt one elsewhere given, in
   the Hall manuscripts.]

   When Washington had made his retreat from New York, Thomas Paine published
   the first number of the Crisis, which, was read to every corporal's guard
   in the camp. It revived the army, reunited the members of the [New York]
   Convention, when despair had reduced them to nine in number, while the
   militia were abandoning their standards and flying in all directions. The
   success of the army at Trenton was, in some degree, owing to this first
   number of the Crisis. In 1778 he discovered the robberies of Silas Deane,
   an agent of the United States in France. He gave in his resignation as
   Secretary, which was accepted by the Congress. In 1779 he was appointed
   Clerk to the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, which office he retained
   until 1780. In 1780 be departed for France with Col. John Laurens,
   commissioned especially by the Congress to the Court at Versailles to
   obtain the aid that was wanted. (See Gordon's Hist., v. iii., p.154.)  
   After his return from France he received the following letter from Col.
   Laurens: 

   "CAROLINA, April 18, 1782.

   "I received the letter wherein you mention my horse and trunk, (the latter
   of which was left at Providence). The misery which the former has suffered
   at different times, by mismanagement, has greatly distressed me. He was
   wounded in service, and I am much attached to him. If he can be of any
   service to you, I entreat your acceptance of him, more especially if you
   will make use of him in bringing you to a country (Carolina) where you
   will be received with open arms, and all that affection and respect which
   one, citizens are anxious to testify to the author of Common Sense, and
   the Crisis.

   "Adieu! I wish you to regard this part of America (Carolina) as your
   particular home -- and everything that I can command in it to be in common
   between us."

   On the 10th of April, 1783, the definitive treaty of peace was received
   and published. Here insert the letter from Gen. Nathaniel Greene: 

   "ASHLEY-RIVES (Carolina), Nov. 18, 1782. --

   "Many people wish to get you into this country. see you are determined to
   follow your genius and not your fortune. I have always been in hopes that
   Congress would have made some handsome acknowledgement to you for past
   services. I must confess that I think you have been shamefully neglected;
   and that America is indebted to few characters more than to you. But as
   your passion leads to fame, and not to wealth, your mortification will be
   the less. Your fame for your writings, will be immortal. At present my
   expenses are great; nevertheless, if you are not conveniently situated, I
   shall take a pride and pleasure in contributing all in my power to render
   your situation happy."4

   The letter from his father. 

   "Dear Son, &c." [Lost.]

   The following letter from William Livingston (Trenton, 4 November, 1784)
   will show that Thomas Paine was not only honored with the esteem of the
   most famous persons, but that they were all convinced that he had been
   useful to the country5.

   At this time Thomas Paine was living with Colonel Kirkbride, Bordentown,
   where he remained till his departure for France. He had bought a house
   [in], and five acres of marshy land over against, Bordentown, near the
   Delaware, which overflowed it frequently. He sold the land in 1787.

   "Congress gave an order for three thousand dollars, which Thomas Paine
   received in the same month.

   "Early in 1787 he departed for France. He carried with him the model of a
   bridge of his own invention and construction, which he submitted, in a
   drawing, to the French Academy, by whom it was approved. From Paris he
   went to London on the 3 September 1787; and in the same month he went to
   Thetford, where he found his father was dead, from the small-pox; and
   where he settled an allowance on his mother of 9 shillings a week.

   A part of 1788 he passed in Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where his bridge was
   cast and erected, chiefly at the expense of the ingenious Mr. Walker. The
   experiment, however, cost Thomas Paine a considerable sum.

   When Burke published his Reflexions on the French Revolution, Thomas Paine
   answered him in his First Part of The Rights of Man. In January, 1792,
   appeared the Second Part of the Rights of Man. The sale of the Rights of
   Man was prodigious, amounting in the course of one year to about a hundred
   thousand copies.

   In 1792 he was prosecuted for his Rights of Man by the Attorney General,,
   McDonald, and was defended by Mr. Erskine, and found guilty of libel. But
   he was now in France, and could not be brought up for judgment.

   Each district of France sent electors to the principal seat of the
   Department, where the Deputies to the National Assembly were chosen. Two
   Departments appointed Thomas Paine their Deputy, those of Oise and of Pas
   de Calais, of which he accepted the latter. He received the following
   letter from the President of the National Assembly, Herault de Sechelles: 

   "To THOMAS  PAINE:

   "France calls you, Sir, to its bosom, to perform one of the most useful
   and most honorable functions, that of contributing, by wise legislation,
   to the happiness of a people, whose destinies interest all who think and
   are united with the welfare of all who suffer in the world.

   "It becomes the nation that has proclaimed the Rights of Man, to desire
   among her legislators him who first dared to estimate the consequences of
   those Rights, and who has developed their principles with that Common
   Sense, which is the only genius inwardly felt by all men, and the
   conception of which springs forth from nature and truth.

   "The National Assembly gave you the title of Citizen, and bad seen with
   pleasure that its decree was sanctioned by the only legitimate authority,
   that of the people, who had already claimed you, even before you were
   nominated.

   "Come, Sir, and enjoy in France the most interesting of, scenes for an
   observer and a philosopher, -- that of a confiding and generous people
   who, infamously betrayed for three years, and wishing at last to end the
   struggle between slavery and liberty, between sincerity and perfidy, at
   length arises in its resolute and gigantic force, gives up to the sword of
   the law those guilty crowned things who betrayed them, resists the
   barbarians whom they raised up to destroy the nation. Her, citizens turned
   soldiers, her territory into camp and fortress, she yet calls and collects
   in congress the lights scattered. through the universe. Men of genius, the
   most capable for their wisdom and virtue, she now calls to give to her
   people a government the most proper to insure their liberty and happiness.

   "The Electoral Assembly of the Department of Oise, anxious to be the first
   to elect you, has been so fortunate as to insure to itself that honour;
   and when many of my fellow citizens desired me to inform you of your
   election, I remembered, with infinite pleasure, having seen you at Mr.
   Jefferson's, and I congratulated myself on having had the pleasure of
   knowing you. 

            "HERAULT,

   "President of the National Assembly."

   At the trial of Louis XVI. before the National Convention Thomas Paine at
   the Tribune, with the deputy Bancal for translator and interpreter, gave
   his opinion, written, on the capital sentence on Louis: -- That, though a
   Deputy of the National Convention of France, he could not forget, that,
   previous to his being that, he was a citizen of the United States of
   America, which owed their liberty to Louis, and that gratitude would not
   allow him to vote for the death of the benefactor of America. On the 21st
   of January, 1793, Louis XVI was beheaded in the Square of Louis XV 
   (Letter to Marat.)6.

   Thomas Paine was named by the Assembly as one of the Committee of
   Legislation, and, as he could not discuss article by article without the
   aid of an interpreter, he drew out a plan of a constitution7.

   The reign of terror began on the night of the 10th of March 1793, when the
   greatest number and the best part of the real friends to freedom had
   retired [from the Convention]. But, as the intention of the conspiracy
   against the Assembly had been suspected, as the greatest part of the
   Deputies they wished to sacrifice had been informed of the threatening
   danger, as, moreover, a mutual fear [existed] of the cunning tyrany of
   some usurper, the conspirators, alarmed, could not this night consummate
   their horrible machinations. They therefore, for this time, confined
   themselves to single degrees of accusation and arrestation against the
   most valuable part of the National Convention. Robespiere had placed
   himself at the head of a conspiring Common-Hall, which dared to dictate
   laws of blood and proscription to the Convention. All those whom he could
   not make bend under a Dictatorship, which a certain number of
   anti-revolutionists feigned to grant him, as a tool which they could
   destroy at pleasure, were guilty of being suspected, and secretly destined
   to disappear from among the living. Thomas Paine, as his marked enemy and
   rival, by favour of the decree on the suspected was classed among
   the suspected, and, as a foreigner, was imprisoned in the Luxembourg in
   December 1793   (See Letter to Washington.)8.

   From this document it will be seen, that, while in the prison, he was, for
   a month, afflicted with an illness that deprived him of his memory. It was
   during this illness of Thomas Paine that the fall of Robespierre took
   place. Mr. Monroe, who arrived at Paris some days afterwards, wrote to Mr.
   Paine, assuring him of his friendship, as appears from the letter to
   Washington. Fifteen days afterwards Thomas Paine received a letter from
   Peter Whiteside.9  In consequence of this letter Thomas Paine wrote a
   memorial to Mr. Monroe. Mr. Monroe now claimed Thomas Paine, and he came
   out of the prison an the 6th of November, 1794, after ten months of
   imprisonment. He went to live with Mr. Monroe, who had cordially offered
   him his house. In a short time after, the Convention called him to take
   his seat in that Assembly; which he did, for the reasons he alleges in his
   letter to Washington.

   The following two pieces Thomas Paine wrote while in Prison: "Essay on
   Aristocracy." "Essay on the Character of Robespierre." [Both missing.]

   Thomas Paine received the following letter from Madame Lafayette, whose
   husband was then a prisoner of war in Austria: 

   "19 BRUMAIRE, PARIS.

   "I was this morning so much agitated by the kind visit from Mr. Monroe,
   that I could hardly find words to speak; but, however, I was, my dear Sir,
   desirous to tell you, that the news of your being set at liberty, which I
   this morning learnt from General Kilmaine, who arrived here at the same
   time with me, has given me a moment's consolation in the midst of this
   abyss of misery, where I shall all my life remain plunged. Gen. Kilmaine
   has told me that you recollected me, and have taken great interest in my
   situation; for which I am exceedingly grateful.

   "Accept, along with Mr. Monroe, my congratulations upon your being
   restored to each other, and the assurances of these sentiments from her
   who is proud to proclaim them, and who well deserved the title of citizen
   of that second country, though I have assuredly never failed, nor shall
   ever fail, to the former. Salut and friendship.

   "With all sincerity of my heart, 

            "N. LAFAYETTE."

   On the 27 January, 1794, Thomas Paine published in Paris, the First Part
   of "The Age of Reason."

   Seeing the state of things in America, Thomas Paine wrote a letter to Gen.
   Washington, 22 February 1795. Mr. Monroe entreated him not to send it,
   and, accordingly it was not sent to Washington; but it was afterwards
   published.

   A few months after his going out of prison, he had a violent fever. Mrs.
   Monroe showed him all possible kindness and attention. She provided him
   with an excellent nurse, who had for him all the anxiety and assiduity of
   a sister. She neglected nothing to afford him case and comfort, when he
   was totally unable to help himself. He was in the state of a helpless
   child who has its face and hands washed by its mother. The surgeon was the
   famous Dessault, who cured him of an abscess which he had in his side.
   After the horrible 13 Brumaire, a friend of Thomas Paine being very sick,
   lie, who was in the house, went to bring his own excellent nurse to take
   care of his sick friend: a fact of little account in itself, but a sure
   evidence of ardent and active friendship and kindness.

   The Convention being occupied with a discussion of the question of what
   Constitution ought to be adopted, that of 1791 or that of 1793, Thomas
   Paine made a speech (July 7, 1795) as a member of the [original] Committee
   [on the Constitution] and Lanthenas translated it and read it in the
   Tribune. This speech has been translated into English, and published in
   London; but, the language of the author has been changed by the two
   translations. It is now given as written by the author. [Missing.]

   In April, 1796, he wrote his Decline and Fall of the British System of
   Finance; and, on the 30th of July of that year he sent his letter to
   Washington off for America by Mr. ____ who sent it to Mr. Bache, a
   newspaper printer of Philadelphia, to be published, and it was published
   the same year. The name of the gentleman who conveyed the letter, and who
   wrote the following to Thomas Paine, is not essential and therefore we
   suppress it. [Missing.]

   We here insert a letter from Talleyrand, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
   to show that Thomas Paine was always activeand attentive in doing every
   thing which would be useful to America. [Missing.]

   Thomas Paine after he came out of prison and had reentered the Convention
   wrote the following letter. [Missing.]

   The following is essentially connected with the foregoing: Paris, October
   4, 1796." [Missing.]

   In October, 1796, Thomas Paine published the Second Part of the Age of
   Reason.

   This year Mr. Monroe departed from France, and soon after Thomas Paine
   went to Havre de Grace, to embark for the United States. But, he did not,
   upon inquiry, think it prudent to go, on account of the great number of
   English vessels then cruizing in the Channel. He therefore came back to
   Paris; but, while at Havre, wrote the following letter, 13 April 1797, to
   a friend at Paris. [Missing.]

   The following letter will not, we hope, seem indifferent to the reader:
   "Dear Sir, I wrote to you etc." [Missing.]

   At this time it was that Thomas Paine took up his abode at Mr.
   Bonneville's, who had known him at the Minister Roland's, and as Mr. B.
   spoke English, Thomas Paine addressed himself to him in a more familiar
   and friendly manner than to any other persons of the society. It was a
   reception of Hospitality which was here given to Thomas Paine for a week
   or a fortnight; but, the visit lasted till 1802, when he and Mr.
   Bonneville parted, -- alas never to meet again!

   Our House was at No. 4 Rue du Theatre Franc,ois. All the first floor was
   occupied as a printing office. The whole house was pretty well filled; and
   Mr. Bonneville gave up his study, which was not a large one, and a
   bedchamber to Thomas Paine. He was always in his apartments excepting at
   meal times. He rose late. He then used to read the newspapers, from which,
   though he understood but little of the French language when spoken, he did
   not fail to collect all the material information relating to politics, in
   which subject he took most delight. When he had his morning's reading, be
   used to carry back the journals to Mr. Bonneville, and they had a chat
   upon the topicks of the day.

   If he had a short jaunt to take, as for instance, to Puteaux just by the
   bridge of Neuilly, where Mr. Skipwith lived, he always went on foot, after
   suitable preparations for the journey in that way. I do not believe be
   ever hired a coach to go out on pleasure during the whole of his stay in
   Paris. He laughed at those who, depriving themselves of a wholesome
   exercise, could make no other excuse for the want of it than that they
   were able to take it whenever they pleased. He was never idle in the
   house. If not writing he was busily employed on some mechanical invention,
   or else entertaining his visitors. Not a day escaped without his receiving
   many visits. Mr, Barlow, Mr. Fulton, Mr. Smith [Sir Robert] came very
   often to see him. Many travellers also called on him; and, often, having
   no other affair, talked to him only of his great reputation and their
   admiration of his works. He treated such visitors with civility, but with
   little ceremony, and, when their conversation was mere chit-chat, and he
   found they had nothing particular to say to him, he used to retire to his
   own pursuits, leaving them to entertain themselves with their own ideas.

   He sometimes spent his evenings at Mr. Barlow's, where

   Mr. Fulton lived, or at Mr. Smith's [Sir Robert], and sometimes at an
   Irish Coffee-house in Conde Street, where Irish, English, and American
   people met. He here learnt the state of politics in England and America.
   He never went out after dinner without first taking a nap, which was
   always of two or three hours length. And, when he went out to a dinner
   of parade, he often came home for the purpose of taking his accustomed
   sleep. It was seldom he went into the society of French people; except
   when, by seeing some one in office or power, he could obtain some favour
   for his countrymen who might be in need of his good offices. These he
   always performed with pleasure, and he never failed to adopt the most
   likely means to secure success. But in one instance he failed. He wrote as
   follows to Lord Cornwallis; but, he did not save Napper Tandy. Letter to
   Lord Cornwallis. Letter 27 Brumaire, 4 year. Letter 23 Germinal 4 year.
   [The three letters missing.]

   C. Jourdan made a report to the Convention on the reestablishment
   of Bells, which had been suppressed, and, in great part melted. Paine
   published, on this occasion, a letter to C. Jourdan10.

   He had brought with him from America, as we have seen, a model of a bridge
   of his own construction and invention, which, model had been adopted in
   England for building bridges under his own direction. He employed part of
   his time, while at our house, in bringing this model to high perfection,
   and this accomplished to his wishes. He afterwards, and according the
   model, made a bridge of lead, which he accomplished by moulding different
   blocks of lead, which, when joined together, made the form that he
   required. This was most pleasant amusement for him. Though he fully relied
   on the strength of his new bridge, and would produce arguments enough in
   proof of its infallible strength, he often demonstrated the proof by blows
   of the sledge-hammer, not leaving anyone in doubt on the subject. One
   night he took off the scaffold of his bridge and seeing that it stood firm
   under the repeated strokes of hammer, he was so ravished that an enjoyment
   so great was not to be sufficiently felt if confined to his own bosom. He
   was not satisfied without admirers of his success. One night we had just
   gone to bed, and were surprised at hearing repeated strokes of the hammer.
   Paine went into Mr. Bonneville's room and besought him to go and see his
   bridge. come and look, said he, it bears all my blows and stands like a
   rock. Mr. Bonneville arose, as well to please himself by seeing a happy
   man as to please him by looking at his bridge. Nothing would do, unless I
   saw the sight as well as Mr. Bonneville. After much exultation: "nothing,
   in the world," said he, "is so fine as my bridge"; and, seeing me standing
   by without uttering a word, he added, "except a woman!" which happy
   compliment to the sex he seemed to think, a full compensation for the
   trouble caused by this nocturnal visit to the bridge.

   A machine for planing boards was his next invention, which machine be had
   executed partly by one blacksmith and partly by another. The machine being
   put together by him, he placed it on the floor, and with it planed boards
   to any number that he required, to make some models of wheels. Mr.
   Bonneville has two of these wheels now. There is a specification of the
   wheels, given by Mr. Paine himself. This specification, together with a
   drawing of the model, made by Mr. Fulton, were deposited at Washington, in
   February 1811; and the other documents necessary to obtain a patent as an
   invention of Thomas Paine, for the benefit of Madam Bonneville. To be
   presented to the Directory of France, a memorial on the progress and
   construction of iron bridges. On this subject the two pieces here
   subjoined will throw sufficient light. (Memoir upon Bridges.-- Upon Iron
   Bridges. -- To the Directory -- Memoir on the Progress and Construction,
   &c.)

   Preparations were made, real or simulated, for a Descent upon England.
   Thomas Paine was consulted by B. 8. who was then in the house of Talma,
   and he wrote the following notes and instructions. Letter at Brussells. --
   The C,a-ira of America.-- To the Consul Lepeaux.11

   Chancellor Livingston, after his arrival in France, came a few times to
   see Paine. One morning we had him at breakfast, Dupuis, the author of the
   Origin of Worship, being of the party; and Mr. Livingston, when he got up
   to go away, said to Mr. Paine smiling, "Make your Will; leave the
   mechanics, the iron bridge, the wheels, etc. to America, and your religion
   to France."

   Thomas Paine, while at our house, published in Mr. Bonneville's journal
   (the Bien Informe) several articles on passing events.12

   A few days before his departure for America, he said, at Mr. Smith's [Sir
   Robert] that he had nothing to detain him in France; for that he was
   neither in love, debt, nor difficulty. Some lady observed, that it was
   not, in the company of ladies, gallant to say he was not in love. Upon
   this occasion he wrote the New Covenant, from the Castle in the Air to
   the Little Corner of the World, in three stanzas, and sent it with the
   following words: 

   "As the ladies are better judges of gallantry than the men are, I will
   thank you to tell me, whether the enclosed be gallantry. If it be, it is
   truly original; and the merit of it belongs to the person who inspired
   it." The following was the answer of Mrs. Smith. "If the usual style of
   gallantry was as clever as your new covenant, many a fair ladies heart
   would be in danger, but the Little Corner of the World receives it from
   the Castle in the Air; it is agreeable to her as being the elegant fancy
   of a friend. 

            "C. SMITH." [Stanzas missing.]

   At this time, 1802, public spirit was at end in France. The real
   republicans were harrassed by eternal prosecutions. Paine was a truly
   grateful man: his friendship was active and warm, and steady. During the
   six years that he lived in our house, he frequently pressed us to go to
   America, offering us all that he should be able to do for us, and saying
   that he would bequeath his property to our children. Some affairs of great
   consequence made it impracticable for Mr. Bonneville to quit France; but,
   foreseeing a new revolution, that would strike, personally, many of the
   Republicans, it was resolved, soon after the departure of Mr. Paine for
   America, that I should go thither with my children, relying fully on the
   good offices of Mr. Paine, whose conduct in America justified that
   reliance.

   In 1802 Paine left France, regretted by all who knew him. He embarked at
   Havre de Grace on board a stout ship, belonging to Mr. Patterson, of
   Baltimore, be being the only passenger. After a very stormy passage, be
   landed at Baltimore on the 30th of October, 1812. He remained there but a
   few days, and then went to Washington, where he published his Letters to
   the Americans.

   A few months afterwards, he went to Bordentown, to his friend Col.
   Kirkbride, who had invited him, on his return, by the following letter of
   12 November, 1802. [Missing.]

   He staid at Bordentown about two months, and then went to New York, where
   a great number of patriots gave him a splendid dinner at the City Hotel.
   In June, 1803, be went to Stonington, New England, to see some friends;
   and in the autumn he went to his farm at New Rochelle. (The letter of
   Thomas Paine to Mr. Bonneville, 20 Nov., 1803.)   [Missing.]

   An inhabitant of this village offered him an apartment, of which he
   accepted, and while here he was taken ill. His complaint was a sort of
   paralytic affection, which took away the use of his bands. He had had the
   same while at Mr. Monroe's in Paris, after he was released from prison.
   Being better, he went to his farm, where he remained a part of the winter,
   and he came to New York to spend the rest of it; but in the spring (1804)
   be went back to his farm. The farmer who had had his farm for 17 or 18
   years, instead of paying his rent, brought Mr. Paine a bill for fencing,
   which made Paine his debtor! They had a law-suit by which Paine got
   nothing but the right of paying the law-expenses! This and other necessary
   expenses compelled him to sell sixty acres of his land. He then gave the
   honest farmer notice to quit the next April (1805).

   Upon taking possession of the farm himself, he hired Christopher Derrick
   to cultivate it for him. He soon found that Derrick was not fit for his
   place, and lie, therefore, discharged him. This was in the summer; and, on
   Christmas Eve ensuing, about six o'clock, Mr. Paine being in his room, on
   the ground floor, reading, a gun was fired a few yards from the window.
   The contents of the gun struck the bottom part of the window, and all the
   charge, which was of small shot, lodged, as was next day discovered, in
   the window sill and wall. The shooter, in firing the gun, fell; and the
   barrel of the gun had entered the ground where he fell, and left an
   impression, which Thomas Paine observed the next morning. Thomas Paine
   went immediately to the house of a neighboring farmer, and there (seeing a
   gun, he took hold of it, and perceived that the muzzle of the gun was
   filled with fresh earth. And then he heard that Christopher Derick had
   borrowed the gun about five o'clock the evening before, and had returned
   it again before six o'clock the same evening. Derick was arrested, and
   Purdy, his brother farmer, became immediately and voluntarily his bail.
   The cause was brought forward at New Rochelle; and Derick was acquitted.13

   In 1806 Thomas Paine offered to vote at New Rochelle for the election. But
   his vote was not admitted; on the pretence only of his not being a citizen
   of America; whereon he wrote the following letters. [The letters are here
   missing, but no doubt the same as those on pp. 379-80 of this volume,
   Conway's "The Life of Thomas Paine," vol. ii.]

   This case was pleaded before the Supreme Court of New York by Mr. Riker,
   then Attorney General, and, though Paine lost his cause, I as his legatee,
   did not lose the having to pay for it. It is however, an undoubted fact,
   that Mr. Paine was an American Citizen.

   He remained at New Rochelle till June 1807; till disgust of every kind,
   occasioned by the gross and brutal conduct of some of the people there,
   made him resolve to go and live at New York.

   On the 4th of April, 1807, he wrote the following letter to Mr. Bonneville
   [in Paris]: 

   "MY  DEAR  BONNEVILLE:

   "Why don't you come to America. Your wife and two boys, Benjamin and
   Thomas, are here, and in good health. They all speak English very well;
   but Thomas has forgot his French. I intend to provide for the boys, but, I
   wish to see you here. We heard of you by letters by Madget and Captain
   Hailey. Mrs. Bonneville, and Mrs. Thomas, an English woman keep an academy
   for young ladies.

   "I send this by a friend, Mrs. Champlin, who will call on Mercier at the
   Institute, to know where you are.

   "Your affectionate friend."

   And some time after the following letter. 

   "MY  DEAR  BONNEVILLE:

   "I received your letter by Mrs. Champlin, and also the letter for Mrs.
   Bonneville, and one from her sister. I have written to the American
   Minister in Paris, Mr. Armstrong, desiring him to interest himself to have
   your surveillance taken off on condition of your coming to join your
   family in the United States.

   "This letter, with Mrs. Bonneville's, come to you under cover to the
   American Minister from Mr. Madison, Secretary of State. As soon as you
   receive it I advise you to call on General Armstrong and inform him of the
   proper method to have your surveillance taken off. Mr. Champagny, who
   succeeds Talleyrand, is, I suppose, the same who was Minister of the
   Interior, from whom I received a handsome friendly letter, respecting the
   iron bridge. I think you once went with me to see him.

   "Call on Mr. Skipwith with my compliments. He will inform you what vessels
   will sail for New York and where from. Bordeaux will be the best place to
   sail from. I believe Mr. Lee is American Consul at Bordeaux. When you
   arrive there, call on him, with my compliments. You may contrive to arrive
   at New York in April or May. The passages., in the Spring, are generally
   short; seldom more than five weeks, and often less.

   "Present my respects to Mercier, Bernardin St. Pierre, Dupuis, Gregoire.
   -- When you come, I intend publishing all my works, and those I have yet
   in manuscript, by subscription. They will make 4 or 5 Vol. 4DEG, or 5 vol.
   8DEG, about 400 pages each.

   "Yours in friendship.
    

            "T. P."14

   While Paine was one day taking his usual after-dinner nap, an old woman
   called, and, asking for Mr. Paine, said she had something of great
   importance to communicate to him. She was shown into his bed-chamber; and
   Paine, raising himself on his elbow, and turning towards the woman, said:
   "What do you want with me?" "I came," said she, "from God, to tell you,
   that if you don't repent, and believe in Christ, you'll be dammed." "Poh,
   poh, it's not true," said Paine; "you are not sent with such an
   impertinent message. Send her away. Pshaw! God would not send such a
   foolish ugly old woman as you. Turn this messenger out. Getaway; be off:
   shut the door." And so the old woman packed herself off.

   After his arrival Paine published several articles in the newspapers of
   New York and Philadelphia. Subsequent to a short illness which he had in
   1807, he could not walk without pain, and the difficulty of walking
   increased every day. On the 21st of January, 1808, he addressed a memorial
   to the Congress of the United States, asking remuneration for his
   services; and, on the 14th of February, the same year, another on the same
   subject. These documents and his letter to the Speaker are as follows.15

   The Committee of Claims, to which the memorial had been submitted, passed
   the following resolution: "Resolved, that Thomas Paine has leave to
   withdraw his memorial and the papers accompanying the same." He was deeply
   grieved at this refusal; some have blamed him for exposing himself to it.
   But, it should be recollected, that his expenses were greatly augmented by
   his illness, and he saw his means daily diminish, while he feared a total
   palsy; and while he expected to live to a very great age, as his ancestors
   had before him. His money yielded no interest, always having been
   unwilling to place money out in that way.

   He had made his will in 1807, during the short illness already noticed.
   But three months later, he assembled his friends, and read to them another
   will; saying that he had believed such and such one to be his friend, and
   that now having altered his belief in them, he had also altered his will.
   From motives of the same kind, he, three months before his death, made
   another will, which he sealed up and directed to me, and gave it me to
   keep, observing to me, that I was more interested in it than any body
   else.

   He wished to be buried in the Quaker burying ground, and sent for a member
   of the committee [Willett Hicks] who lived in the neighborhood. The
   interview took place on the 19th of March, 1809. Paine said, when we were
   looking out for another lodging, we had to put in order the affairs of our
   present abode. This was precisely the case with him; all his affairs were
   settled, and he had only to provide his burying ground; his father had
   been a Quaker, and he hoped they would not refuse him a grave I will,"
   added he, "pay for the digging of it."

   The committee of the Quakers refused to receive his body, at which he
   seemed deeply moved, and observed to me, who was present at the interview,
   that their refusal was foolish. "You will," said I, "be buried on your
   farm." "I have no objection to that," said lie "but the farm will be sold,
   and they will dig my bones up before they be half rotten." "Mr. Paine," I
   replied, "have confidence in your friends. I assure you, that the place
   where you will be buried, shall never be sold." He seemed satisfied; and
   never spoke upon this subject again. I have been as good as my word.

   Last December [1818] the land of the farm having been divided between my
   children, I gave fifty dollars to keep apart and to myself, the place
   whereon the grave was.

   Paine, doubtless, considered me and my children as strangers in America.
   His affection for us was, at any rate, great and sincere. He anxiously
   recommended us to the protection of Mr. Emmet, saying to him, "when I am
   dead, Madam Bonneville will have no friend here." And a little time after,
   obliged to draw money from the Bank, he said, with an air of sorrow, "you
   will have nothing left."16

   He was now become extremely weak. His strength and appetite daily departed
   from him; and in the day-time only he was able, when not in bed, to sit up
   in his arm-chair to read the newspapers, and sometimes write. When he
   could no longer quit his bed, he made some one read the newspapers to him.
   His mind was always active. He wrote nothing for the press after writing
   his last will, but he would converse, and took great interest in politics.
   The vigour of his mind, which had always so strongly characterized him,
   did not leave him to the last moment. He never complained of his bodily
   sufferings, though they became excessive. His constitution was strong. The
   want of exercise alone was the cause of his sufferings. Notwithstanding
   the great inconveniences he was obliged to sustain during his illness, in
   a carman's house [Ryder's], in a small village [Greenwich], without any
   bosom friend in whom he could repose confidence, without any society he
   liked, he still did not complain of his sufferings. I indeed, went
   regularly to see him twice a week; but, he said to me one day: "am here
   alone, for all these people are nothing to me, day after day, week after
   week, month after month, and you don't come to see me."

   In a conversation between him and Mr. [Albert] Gallatin, about this time,
   I recollect his using these words: "I am very sorry that I ever returned
   to this country." As he was thus situated and paying a high price for his
   lodgings17 he expressed a wish to come to my house. This must be a great
   inconvenience to me from the frequent visits to Mr. Thomas Paine; but, I,
   at last, consented; and hired a house in the neighborhood, in May 1809, to
   which he was carried in an arm-chair, after which he seemed calm and
   satisfied, and gave himself no trouble about anything. He had no disease
   that required a Doctor, though Dr. Romaine came to visit him twice a week.
   The swelling, which had commenced at his feet, had now reached his body,
   and some one had been so officious as to tell him that he ought to be
   tapped. He asked me if this was necessary. I told him, that I did not
   know; but, that, unless he was likely to derive great good from it, it
   should not be done. The next [day] Doctor Romaine came and brought a
   physician with him, and they resolved that the tapping need not take
   place.

   He now grew weaker and weaker very fast. A very few days before his death,
   Dr. Romaine said to me, "I don't think he can live till night." Paine,
   hearing some one speak, opens his eyes, and said: "'T is you Doctor: what
   news?" "Mr. such an one is gone to France on such business." "He will do
   nothing there," said Paine. "Your belly diminishes," said the Doctor. "And
   yours augments," said Paine.

   When be was near his end, two American clergymen came to see him, and to
   talk with him on religious matters. "Let me alone," said he; "good
   morning." He desired they should be admitted no more. One of his friends
   came to New York; a person for whom he had a great esteem, and whom he had
   not seen for a long while. He was overjoyed at seeing him; but, this
   person began to speak upon religion, and Paine turned his head on the
   other side, and remained silent, even to the adieu of the person18.

   Seeing his end fast approaching, I asked him, in presence of a friend, if
   he felt satisfied with the treatment he had received at our house, upon
   which he could only exclaim, O! yes! He added other words, but they were
   incoherent. It Was impossible for me not to exert myself to the utmost in
   taking care of a person to whom I and my children owed so much. He now
   appeared to have lost all kind of feeling. He spent the night in
   tranquillity, and expired in the morning at eight o'clock, after a short
   oppression, at my house in Greenwich, about two miles from the city of New
   York. Mr. Jarvis, a Painter, who had formerly made a portrait of him,
   moulded his head in plaster, from which a bust was executed.

   He was, according to the American custom, deposited in a mahogany coffin,
   with his name and age engraved on a silverplate, put on the coffin. His
   corpse was dressed in a shirt, a muslin gown tied at neck and wrists with
   black ribbon, stockings, drawers; and a cap was put under his head as a
   pillow. (He never slept in a night-cap.)   Before the coffin was placed on
   the carriage, I went to see him; and having a rose in my bosom, I took it
   out, and placed on his breast. Death had not disfigured him. Though very
   thin, his bones were not protuberant. He was not wrinkled, and had lost
   very little hair.

   His voice was very strong even to his last moments. He often exclaimed,
   oh, lord help me! An exclamation the involuntary effect of pain. He
   groaned deeply, and when a question was put to him, calling him by his
   name, he opened his eyes, as if waking from a dream. He never answered the
   question, but asked one himself; as, what is it o'clock, &c.

   On the ninth of June my son and I, and a few of Thomas Paine's friends,
   set off with the corpse to New Rochelle, a place 22 miles from New York.
   It was my intention to have him buried in the Orchard of his own farm; but
   the farmer who lived there at that time said, that Thomas Paine, walking
   with him one day, said, pointing to another part of the land, he was
   desirous of being buried there. "Then," said I, "that shall be the place
   of his burial." And, my instructions were accordingly put in execution.
   The headstone was put up about a week afterwards with the following
   inscription:   "Thomas Paine, Author of "Common Sense," died the eighth of
   June, 1809, aged 72 years." According to his will, a wall twelve feet
   square was erected round his tomb. Four trees have been planted outside
   the wall, two weeping willows and two cypresses. Many persons have taken
   away pieces of the tombstone and of the trees, in memory of the deceased;
   foreigners especially have been eager to obtain these memorials, some of
   which have been sent to England19. They have been put in frames and
   preserved. Verses in honor of Paine have been written on the bead stone.
   The grave is situated at the angle of the farm, by the entrance to it.

   This interment was a scene to affect and to wound any sensible heart.
   Contemplating who it was, what man it was, that we were committing to an
   obscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land, I could not help
   feeling most acutely. Before the earth was thrown down upon the coffin, I,
   placing myself at the east end of the grave, said to my son Benjamin,
   "stand you there, at the other end, as a witness for grateful America."
   Looking round me, and beholding the small group of spectators, I
   exclaimed, as the earth was tumbled into the grave, "Oh! Mr. Paine! My son
   stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I, for France!"
   This was the funeral ceremony of this great politician and philosopher!20

   The eighty-eight acres of the north part were sold at 25 dollars an acre.
   The half of the south (the share of Thomas de Bonneville) has been sold
   for the total sum of 1425 dollars. The other part of the south, which was
   left to Benjamin de Bonneville, has just (1819) been sold in lots,
   reserving the spot in which Thomas Paine was buried, being a piece of land
   45 feet square.

   Thomas Paine's posthumous works. He left the manuscript of his answer to
   Bishop Watson; the Third Part of his Age of Reason; several pieces on
   Religious subjects, prose and verse. The great part of his posthumous
   political works will be found in the Appendix. Some correspondences cannot
   be, as yet, published21.

   In Mechanics he has left two models of wheels for carriages, and of a
   machine to plane boards. Of the two models of bridges, left at the
   Philadelphia Museum, only one has been preserved, and that in great
   disorder, one side being taken entirely off. But, I must say here, that it
   was then out of the hands of Mr. Peale.22

   Though it is difficult, at present, to make some people believe that,
   instead of being looked on as a deist and a drunkard, Paine ought to be
   viewed as a philosopher and a truly benevolent man, future generations
   will make amends for the errors of their forefathers, by regarding him as
   a most worthy man, and by estimating his talents and character according
   to their real worth.

   Thomas Paine was about five feet nine inches high, English measure, and
   about five feet six French measure. His bust was well proportioned; and
   his face oblong. Reflexion was the great expression of his face; in which
   was always seen the calm proceeding from a conscience void of reproach.
   His eye, which was black, was lively and piercing, and told us that he saw
   into the very heart of hearts [of any one who wished to deceive him]23. A
   most benignant smile expressed what he felt upon receiving an affectionate
   salutation, or praise delicately conveyed. His leg and foot were elegant,
   and he stood and walked upright, without stiffness or affectation. [He
   never wore a sword nor cane], but often walked with his hat in one hand
   and with his other hand behind his back. His countenance, when walking,
   was generally thoughtful. In receiving salutations he bowed very
   gracefully, and, if from an acquaintance, he did not begin with "how d' ye
   do?" but, with a "what news?" If they had none, he gave them his. His
   beard, his lips, his head, the motion of his eye-brow, all aided in
   developing his mind.

   Was he where he got at the English or American newspapers, he hastened to
   over-run them all, like those who read to make extracts for their paper.
   His first glance was for the funds, which, in spite of jobbing and the
   tricks of government, he always looked on as the sure thermometer of
   public affairs. Parliamentary Debates, the Bills, concealing a true or
   sham opposition of such or such orators, the secret pay and violent
   theatrical declamation, or the revelations of public or private meetings
   at the taverns; these interested him so much that he longed for an ear and
   a heart to pour forth all his soul. When he added that he knew the
   Republican or the hypocrite, he would affirm, beforehand, that such or
   such a bill, such or such a measure, would take place; and very seldom, in
   such a case, the cunning politic or the clear-sighted observer was
   mistaken in his assertions; for they were not for him mere conjectures. He
   spoke of a future event as of a thing past and consummated. In a country
   where the slightest steps are expanded to open day, where the feeblest
   connexions are known from their beginning, and with all the views of
   ambition, of interest or rivalship, it is almost impossible to escape the
   eye of such an observer as Thomas Paine, whom no private interest could
   blind or bewitch, as was said by the clear-sighted Michael Montaigne.

   His writings are generally perspicuous and full of light, and often they
   discover the sardonic and sharp smile of Voltaire. One may see that he
   wishes to wound to the quick; and that he hugs himself in his success. But
   Voltaire all at once overruns an immense space and resumes his vehement
   and dramatic step: Paine stops you, and points to the place where you
   ought to smile with him at the ingenious traits; a gift to envy and
   stupidity.

   Thomas Paine did not like to be questioned. He used to say, that he
   thought nothing more impertinent, than to say to any body: "What do you
   think of that?" On his arrival at New York, he went to see General Gates.
   After the usual words of salutation, the General said:" I have always had
   it in mind, if I ever saw you again, to ask you whether you were married,
   as people have said." Paine not answering, the General went on: "Tell me
   how it is." "I never," said Paine, "answer impertinent questions."

   Seemingly insensible and hard to himself, he was not so to the just
   wailings of the unhappy. Without any vehement expression of his sorrow,
   you might see him calling up all his powers, walking silently, thinking of
   the best means of consoling the unfortunate applicant; and never did they
   go from him without some rays of hope. And as his will was firm and
   settled, his efforts were always successful. The man hardened in vice and
   in courts [of law], yields more easily than one imagines to the manly
   entreaties of a disinterested benefactor.

   Thomas Paine loved his friends with sincere and tender affection. His
   simplicity of heart and that happy kind of openness, or rather,
   carelessness, which charms our hearts in reading the fables of the good
   Lafontaine, made him extremely amiable. If little children were near him
   he patted them, searched his pockets for the store of cakes, biscuits,
   sugarplums, pieces of sugar, of which he used to take possession as of a
   treasure belonging to them, and the distribution of which belonged to
   him24. His conversation was unaffectedly simple and frank; his language
   natural; always abounding in curious anecdotes. He justly and fully seized
   the characters of all those of whom he related any singular traits. For
   his conversation was satyrick, instructive, full of witticisms. If he
   related an anecdote a second time, it was always in the same words and the
   same tone, like a comic actor who knows the place where he is to be
   applauded. He neither cut the tale short nor told it too circumstantially.
   It was real conversation, enlivened by digressions well brought in. The
   vivacity of his mind, and the numerous scones of which be bad been a
   spectator, or in which be bad been an actor, rendered his narrations the
   more animated, his conversation more endearing. His memory was admirable.
   Politics were his favorite subject. He never spoke on religious subjects,
   unless pressed to it, and never disputed about such matters. He could not
   speak French: he could understand it tolerably well when spoken to him,
   and be understood it when on paper perfectly well. He never went to the
   theatre: never spoke on dramatic subjects. He rather delighted in
   ridiculing poetry. He did not like it: he said it was not a serious thing,
   but a sport of the mind, which often had not common sense. His common
   reading was the affairs of the day; not a single newspaper escaped him;
   not a political discussion: he knew how to strike while the iron was hot;
   and, as he was always on the watch, he was always ready to write. Hence
   all his pamphlets have been popular and powerful. He wrote with composure
   and steadiness, as if under the guidance of a tutelary genius. If, for an
   instant, be stopped, it was always in the attitude of a man who listens.
   The Saint Jerome of Raphael would give a perfect idea of his contemplative
   recollection, to listen to the voice from on high which makes itself heard
   in the heart.

   [It will be proper, I believe, to say here, that shortly after the Death
   of Thomas Paine a book appeared, under the title of: The Life of Thomas
   Paine, by Cheetham. In this libel my character was calumniated. I cited
   the Author before the Criminal Court of New York. He was tried and in
   spite of all his manaeuvres, he was found guilty. -- M. B. de
   Bonneville.].

   This last paragraph, in brackets, is in the writing of Madame Bonneville.

   I am indebted to Mr. Robert Waters, of Jersey City, a biographer of
   Cobbett, for the suggestion, made through a friend, and so amply
   justified, that information concerning Paine might be derived from the
   Cobbett papers.

   Footnotes

    

   1.     The bracketed words, Madame Bonneville's, are on a separate slip.
   An opening paragraph by Cobbett is crossed out by her pen: "The early
   years of the life of a Great Man are of little consequence to the world.
   Whether Paine made stays or gauged barrels before he became a public
   character, is of no more importance to us than whether he was swaddled
   with woollen or with linen. It is the man, in conjunction with those
   labours which have produced so much effect in the world, whom we are to
   follow and contemplate. Nevertheless, since many pretended histories of
   the life of Paine have been published, etc."

   2.     The dates given by Cobbett from contemporary histories require
   revision, by the light of the careful researches made by myself and
   others, as given at the beginning of this biography.

   3.     From Crisis VII, dated Philadelphia, November 21, 1778. in
   Cobbett's MS. the extract is only indicated.

   4.     This and the preceding letter supplied by the author.

   5.     Not found. Referred to in this work, Conway "The Life of Thomas
   Paine", vol. i., p.200.

   6.     Both missing. Possibly the second should be to Danton. See
   Conway "The Life of Thomas Paine," ii, p.53.

   7.     See Conway "The Life of Thomas Paine," ii., p.37 seq., of this
   work.

   8.     This is the bitter letter of which when it appeared Cobbett had
   written such a scathing review.

   9.     The letter telling him of the allegations made by some against his
   American citizenship.

   10.  The words "which will find a place in the Appendix" are here crossed
   out by Madame Bonneville. See Conway, "The Life of Thomas Paine," ii.,
   p.258 concerning Jourdan.

   11.  This paragraph is in the writing of Madame Bonneville. "B. B." means
   Bonaparte, and seems to be some cipher. All of the pieces by Paine
   mentioned are missing; also that addressed "To the Directory," for the
   answer to which see p. 296 of this volume (ii) of Conway's "The Life of
   Thomas Paine."

   12.  The following words are here crossed out: "Also several pieces of
   poetry, which will be published hereafter, with his miscellaneous prose."

   13.  See Conway "The Life of Thomas Paine,", p.343 of this volume (ii).
   Several paragraphs here are in the writing of J. P. Cobbett, then with his
   father in New York.

   14.  This letter is entirely in the writing of Madame Bonneville. Beneath
   it is written: "The above is a true copy of the original; I have compared
   the two together.-- James P. Cobbett." The allusion to Champagny is either
   a slip of Madame's pen or Paine's memory. The minister who wrote him
   (p.450) about his bridge was Chaptal. See Conway "The Life of Thomas
   Paine," ii., p.296. The names in the last paragraph show what an
   attractive literary circle Paine had left in France, for a country unable
   to appreciate him.

   15.  "Are as follows" in Madame B.'s writing, after striking out Cobbett's
   words, "will be found in the Appendix." The documents and letters are not
   given, but they are well known. See Conway "The Life of Thomas
   Paine," ii., p.405.

   16.  Paine's Will appoints Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton (with $200
   each), and Madame Bonneville executors; gives a small bequest to the widow
   of Elihu Palmer, and a considerable one to Rickman of London, who was to
   (p.452) divide with Nicholas Bonneville proceeds of the sale of the North
   part of his farm. To Madame Bonneville went his manuscripts, movable
   effects, stock in the N. Y. Phoenix Insurance Company estimated at $1500,
   and money in hand. The South part of the New Rochelle farm, over 100
   acres, were given Madame Bonneville in trust for her children, Benjamin
   and Thomas, "their education and maintenance, until they come to the age
   of twenty-one years, in order that she may bring them well up, give them
   good and useful learning, and instruct them in their duty to God, and the
   practice of morality." At majority they were to share and share alike in
   fee simple. He desires to be buried in the Quaker ground, -- "my father
   belonged to that profession, and I was partly brought up in it," -- but if
   this is not permitted, to be buried on his farm. "The place where I am to
   be buried to be a square of twelve feet, to be enclosed with rows of
   trees, and a stone or post and railed fence, with a head-stone with my
   name and age engraved upon it, author of "Common Sense." He confides Mrs.
   Bonneville and her children to the care of Emmet and Morton. "Thus placing
   confidence in their friendship, I herewith take my final leave of them and
   of the world. I have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time
   has been spent in doing good; and I die in perfect composure and
   resignation to the will of my Creator God." The Will, dated January 18,
   1809, opens with the words, "The last Will and Testament of me, the
   subscriber, Thomas Paine, reposing confidence in my Creator God, and in no
   other being, for I know of no other, and I believe in no other." Mrs.
   Paine had died July 27th, 1808.

   Mr. William Fayel, to whom I am indebted for much information concerning
   the Bonnevilles in St. Louis, writes me that so little is known of Paine's
   benefactions, that "an ex-senator of the United States recently asserted
   that Gen. Bonneville was brought over by Jefferson and a French lady; and
   a French lady, who was intimate with the Bonnevilles, assured me that
   General Bonneville was sent to West Point by Lafayette."

   17.  The sentence thus far is struck out by Madame Bonneville.

   18.  Cobbett's words erased: "and Paine could no longer bear the sight of
   him."

   19.  The breaking of the original gravestone has been traditionally
   ascribed to pious hatred. A fragment of it, now in New York, is sometimes
   shown at celebrations of Paine's birthday as a witness of the ferocity
   vented on Paine's grave. it is satisfactory to find another
   interpretation.

   20.  Paine's friends, as we have said, were too poor to leave their work
   in the city, which had refused Paine a grave. The Rev. Robert Bolton, in
   his History of Westchester County, introduces Cheetham's slanders of Paine
   with the words: "as his own biographer remarks." His own! But even
   Cheetham does not lie enough for Bolton, who says, "His [Paine's] body was
   brought up from New York in a hearse used for carrying the dead to
   Potter's Field; a white man drove the vehicle, accompanied by a negro to
   dig the grave." The whole Judas legend is in that allusion to Potter's
   Field. Such is history, where Paine is concerned!

   21.  All except the first two MSS., of which fragments exist, and some
   poems, were no doubt consumed at St. Louis, as stated in the Introduction
   to this work.

   22.  I have vainly searched in Philadelphia for some relic of Paine's
   bridges.

   23.  Bracketed words marked out. In this paragraph and some that follow
   the hand of Nicolas Bonneville is, I think, discernible.

   24.  At this point are the words Barlow's letter [i. e. to Cheetham] we
   agreed to suppress."
