   Like the "disheveled drunk" slander, this is not supported by fact. This
   slander was part of the propaganda to destroy his reputation because his
   enemies could not destroy the content and influence of his writings. The
   farm he owned in New Rochelle was substantial, and he rented it out for
   cultivation. The money in the bank, and stock he owned in a bank, and the
   farm were given to the Bonnevilles, who later divided it up and sold it. 
   He could afford rent and care at the end of his life to the same degree
   that most could, including dedicated friends to look after him, but he ran
   short of cash now and again.  This slander is part of the cruelty shown
   towards him, as Paine refused payments for his works to maintain his
   objectivity, and his refusal of riches was turned upside down to attack
   him.
