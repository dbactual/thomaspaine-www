   Tom Paine has almost no influence on present-day thinking in the United
   States because he is unknown to the average citizen. Perhaps I might say
   right here that this is a national loss and a deplorable lack of
   understanding concerning the man who first proposed and first wrote those
   impressive words, 'the United States of America.' But it is hardly
   strange. Paine's teachings have been debarred from schools everywhere and
   his views of life misrepresented until his memory is hidden in shadows, or
   he is looked upon as of unsound mind.
   We never had a sounder intelligence in this Republic. He was the equal of
   Washington in making American liberty possible. Where Washington performed
   Paine devised and wrote. The deeds of one in the Weld were matched by the
   deeds of the other with his pen. Washington himself appreciated Paine at
   his true worth. Franklin knew him for a great patriot and clear thinker.
   He was a friend and confidant of Jefferson, and the two must often have
   debated the academic and practical phases of liberty.
   I consider Paine our greatest political thinker. As we have not advanced,
   and perhaps never shall advance, beyond the Declaration and Constitution,
   so Paine has had no successors who extended his principles. Although the
   present generation knows little of Paine's writings, and although he has
   almost no influence upon contemporary thought, Americans of the future
   will justly appraise his work. I am certain of it. Truth is governed by
   natural laws and cannot be denied. Paine spoke truth with a peculiarly
   clear and forceful ring. Therefore time must balance the scales. The
   Declaration and the Constitution expressed in form Paine's theory of
   political rights. He worked in Philadelphia at the time that the first
   document was written, and occupied a position of intimate contact with the
   nation's leaders when they framed the Constitution.
   Certainly we may believe that Washington had a considerable voice in the
   Constitution. We know that Jefferson had much to do with the document.
   Franklin also had a hand and probably was responsible in even larger
   measure for the Declaration. But all of these men had communed with Paine.
   Their views were intimately understood and closely correlated. There is no
   doubt whatever that the two great documents of American liberty reflect
   the philosophy of Paine.
   We may look in other directions, where the trace is plainer, easier
   definitely to establish, for evidences of his influence. Paine, you know,
   came over to the Colonies after meeting Franklin in London. He had
   encountered numerous misfortunes, and Franklin gave him letters to friends
   back home which resulted in his becoming editor of the Pennsylvania
   Magazine in January of 1775. It is highly interesting that circumstance
   should have brought him to America at that time and placed him in such a
   position. Paine had little education, in the school sense of the term, but
   he had read avidly and written a great deal before meeting Franklin. Once
   placed at the editor's desk of a new American periodical, he found time
   and opportunity exactly suited to his spirit and his genius.
   The Pennsylvania Magazine began to bristle -- so much so that its owner,
   and the cooler heads of Philadelphia, were worried by Paine's writings.
   Looking back to those times we cannot, without much reading, clearly gauge
   the sentiment of the Colonies. Perhaps the larger number of responsible
   men still hoped for peace with England. They did not even venture to
   express the matter that way. Few men, indeed, had thought in terms of war.
   Then Paine wrote 'Common Sense,' an anonymous tract which immediately
   stirred the fires of liberty. It flashed from hand to hand throughout the
   Colonies. One copy reached the New York Assembly, in session at Albany,
   and a night meeting was voted to answer this unknown writer with his
   clarion call to liberty. The Assembly met, but could find no suitable
   answer. Tom Paine had inscribed a document which never has been answered
   adversely, and never can be, so long as man esteems his priceless
   possession.
   In 'Common Sense' Paine flared forth with a document so powerful that the
   Revolution became inevitable. Washington recognized the difference, and in
   his calm way said that matters never could be the same again. It must be
   remembered that 'Common Sense' preceded the declaration and affirmed the
   very principles that went into the national doctrine of liberty. But that
   affirmation was made with more vigor, more of the fire of the patriot and
   was exactly suited to the hour. It is probable that we should have had the
   Revolution without Tom Paine. Certainly it could not be forestalled, once
   he had spoken.
   I have always been interested in this man. My father had a set of Tom
   Paine's books on the shelf at home. I must have opened the covers about
   the time I was 13. And I can still remember the flash of enlightenment
   which shone from his pages. It was a revelation, indeed, to encounter his
   views on political and religious matters, so different from the views of
   many people around us. Of course I did not understand him very well, but
   his sincerity and ardor made an impression upon me that nothing has ever
   served to lessen.
   I have heard it said that Paine borrowed from Montesquieu and Rousseau.
   Maybe he had read them both and learned something from each. I do not
   know. But I doubt that Paine ever borrowed a line from any man. Perhaps he
   gained strength from the fact that the springs of his wisdom lay within
   himself, and he spoke so clearly because the man's spirit yearned to reach
   other spirits.
   Many a person who could not comprehend Rousseau, and would be puzzled by
   Montesquieu, could understand Paine as an open book. He wrote with a
   clarity, a sharpness of outline and exactness of speech that even a
   schoolboy should be able to grasp. There is nothing false, little that is
   subtle, and an impressive lack of the negative in Paine. He literally
   cried to his reader for a comprehending hour, and then filled that hour
   with such sagacious reasoning as we find surpassed nowhere else in
   American letters -- seldom in any school of writing.
   Paine would have been the last to look upon himself as a man of letters.
   Liberty was the dear companion of his heart; truth in all things his
   object. Yet he has left us such stirring lines as those of 'The Crisis,'
   where he says: 'These are the times that try men's souls.... Tyranny, like
   hell, is not easily conquered!' Even an unappreciative posterity knows
   that line, but we, perhaps, remember him best for his declaration: 'The
   world is my country; to do good my religion.'
   Again we see the spontaneous genius at work in "The Rights of Man," and
   that genius busy at his favorite task -- liberty. Written hurriedly and in
   the heat of controversy, "The Rights of Man" yet compares favorably with
   classical models, and in some places rises to vaulting heights. Its
   appearance outmatched events attending Burke's effort in his
   "Reflections."
   Instantly the English public caught hold of this new contribution. It was
   more than a defense of liberty; it was a world declaration of what Paine
   had declared before in the Colonies. His reasoning was so cogent, his
   command of the subject so broad, that his legion of enemies found it hard
   to answer him. "Tom Paine is quite right," said Pitt, the Prime Minister,
   "but if I were to encourage his views we should have a bloody revolution."
   Here we see the progressive quality of Paine's genius at its best. "The
   Rights of Man" amplified and reasserted what already had been said in
   "Common Sense," with now a greater force and the power of a maturing mind.
   Just when Paine was at the height of his renown, an indictment for treason
   confronted him. About the same time he was elected a member of the
   Revolutionary Assembly and escaped to France.
   So little did he know of the French tongue that addresses to his
   constituents had to be translated by an interpreter. But he sat in the
   assembly. Shrinking from the guillotine, he encountered Robespierre's
   enmity, and presently found himself in prison, facing that dread
   instrument.
   But his imprisonment was fertile. Already he had written the first part of
   "The Age of Reason" and now turned his time to the latter part. Presently
   his second escape cheated Robespierre of vengeance, and in the course of
   events "The Age of Reason" appeared. Instantly it became a source of
   contention which still endures. Paine returned to the United States a
   little broken, and went to live at his home in New Rochelle -- a public
   gift. Many of his old companions in the struggle for liberty avoided him,
   and he was publicly condemned by the unthinking.
   Paine suffered then, as now he suffers not so much because of what he
   wrote as from the misinterpretations of others. He has been called an
   atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence,
   as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of
   deity.
   His Bible was the open face of nature, the broad skies, the green hills.
   He disbelieved the ancient myths and miracles taught by established
   creeds. But the attacks on those creeds -- or on persons devoted to them
   -- have served to darken his memory, casting a shadow across the closing
   years of his life.
   When Theodore Roosevelt termed Tom Paine a dirty little atheist he surely
   spoke from lack of understanding. It was a stricture, an inaccurate charge
   of the sort that has dimmed the greatness of this eminent American. But
   the true measure of his stature will yet be appreciated. The torch which
   he handed on will not be extinguished. If Paine had ceased his writings
   with "The Rights of Man" he would have been hailed today as one of the two
   or three outstanding figures of the Revolution. But "The Age of Reason"
   cost him glory at the hands of his countrymen -- a greater loss to them
   than to Tom Paine.
   I was always interested in Paine the inventor. He conceived and designed
   the iron bridge and the hollow candle; the principle of the modern central
   draught burner. The man had a sort of universal genius. He was interested
   in a diversity of things; but his special creed, his first thought, was
   liberty.
   Traducers have said that he spent his last days drinking in pothouses.
   They have pictured him as a wicked old man coming to a sorry end. But I am
   persuaded that Paine must have looked with magnanimity and sorrow on the
   attacks of his countrymen. That those attacks have continued down to our
   day, with scarcely any abatement, is an indication of how strong
   prejudice, when once aroused, may become. It has been a custom in some
   quarters to hold up Paine as an example of everything bad.
   The memory of Tom Paine will outlive all this. No man who helped to lay
   the foundations of our liberty -- who stepped forth as the champion of so
   difficult a cause -- can be permanently obscured by such attacks. Tom
   Paine should be read by his countrymen. I commend his fame to their hands.
