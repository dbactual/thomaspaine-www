   Harvey Kaye is the Ben and Joyce Rosenberg Professor of Social Change and
   Development at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. This essay was
   printed in TPNHA's journal in May, 2001, and it first appeared in his
   book, Firebrand of the Revolution (Oxford U. Press, 2000).
       We should never fail to recount the story of the American Revolution.
   We should never forget that our nation was forged in struggle, a struggle
   - however inadequate and in need of continual renewal and advancement -
   that was revolutionary. And we should never fail to appreciate the
   fundamental role of the radical Thomas Paine in helping us to realize what
   we might become. Would there have been an American Revolution, an American
   war for independence, had Thomas Paine not written his stirring pamphlet
   Common Sense? Most likely, yes. However, the American Revolution might not
   have been the kind of republican and democratic struggle it became, and
   the course of the nation's development would likely have been quite
   different.
        Born January 29,1737, in Thetford, England, Thomas Paine was the only
   son of Joseph Pain, a Quaker staymaker, and Frances Cocke, the daughter of
   an Anglican lawyer. Neither a happy nor an affluent couple, Joseph and
   Frances nevertheless were extremely fond of their son and committed to his
   receiving a formal education. In addition to educating the boy in the
   Bible at home, they enrolled him in the Thetford Grammar School. Among his
   studies, he most enjoyed science and poetry.
        But Tom's parents could afford to keep him in school only so long.
   When he turned 13, they apprenticed him to his father. In his father's
   workshop, he learned not only the craft of corsetmaking, but also the
   dissenting and egalitarian spirit of the Quakers and the historical memory
   of "turning the world upside down" in the English Revolution of the 1640s
   and 50s.
        An artisan's life apparently afforded insufficient excitement for the
   young man. Two weeks before his twentieth birthday, Tom ran away to serve
   aboard an English privateer, hoping to gain adventure and a bit of money.
   The encounters, rigors, and oppressions on board must have taught him a
   great deal, but hen soon had enough of life between "the devil and the
   deep blue sea." After just a year, he disembarked for London, to work
   again as a journeyman staymaker.
        During the next decade and a half, Tom suffered more than his share
   of tragic disappointments, mistakes and failures. In 1759,he set up shop
   as a master craftsman on the southeast coast where he met and married his
   first love, Mary Lambert. Yet, sadly, within a year Mary died in premature
   childbirth and, for lack of trade, Tom was forced to give up the business.
        In 1764,he secured appointment as an excise officer, but he was
   expelled a year later, supposedly for having stamped goods without
   inspecting them (a not-unusual practice of over-worked excise officers).
   During the next few years he kept himself going by working as a staymaker,
   a teacher, and a preacher while he petitioned for reinstatement in the
   excise service.
        Finally, in early 1768, he received a new posting, to Lewes in
   Sussex. There he boarded with a tobacconist, whose daughter, Elizabeth
   Ollive, he married on the shopkeeper's death. Tom also became active in
   local affairs and a "regular" in the political debates at the White Hart
   Tavern. He soon developed a friendly reputation as a man who enjoyed a few
   good drinks and had a "skill with words."
         Recognizing his talents, Paine's fellow officers chose him to lead
   their campaign for higher salaries. Thus, in 1772 he penned his first
   pamphlet, The Case of the Officers of Excise, and moved to London to lobby
   Parliament. His sojourn back in the capital both increased his knowledge
   and resentment of aristocratic government and politics and renewed his
   awareness of the popular radicalism of the middle and working classes.
   Additionally, it enabled him to renew his interest in natural philosophy
   through attendance at science lectures - occasions that placed him among
   circles of intellectuals and freethinkers which, fortuitously, included
   Benjamin Franklin.
        Unfortunately, the campaign failed and the Excise Commission
   discharged Tom for ignoring his official duties. Making matters worse, the
   tobacco shop also failed, and Tom and his wife agreed to separate.
        Now 37 years old, with few resources and without prospects, but
   possessed of a seemingly indefatigable willingness to try again, Tom
   resolved to go to America. The renowned Ben Franklin himself provided Tom
   with a letter of introduction, but little could either man have suspected
   that the mix of memories and skills, which Paine carried with him, would
   prove so volatile when brought into contact with America.
        America would inspire Paine and he would not only refashion his own
   life, he would contribute, as well, to refashioning American life. Just a
   year after his arrival, he would declare: "We have it in our power to
   begin the world over again." And his words would fire the imagination of
   his new compatriots.
        The America to which Paine journeyed was thriving, dynamic, and
   rebellious. The population of the l3 colonies had reached almost 3
   million. The vast majority lived in the countryside, but Boston, New York,
   Philadelphia and Charleston had developed into prosperous regional
   capitals.
        Colonial life did not simply reflect life in the mother country.
   Americans were more pro-monarchy than the English themselves; but with the
   king and his ministers an ocean away they could afford to be. While rich
   gentlemen "lorded it" over others, actual aristocrats were a rare breed in
   America. And, though religious toleration varied from colony to colony,
   the Church of England never secured the authority it held at home. Rather,
   religious pluralism and enthusiasm characterized American life.
        Moreover in contrast to Britain, America had little unemployment or
   poverty. Although the same property-holding qualifications to vote applied
   in America as in Britain, the colonies were far more democratic places.
   More than half of colonial white men held enough property to vote; they
   governed themselves through elected assemblies (subject to the veto power
   of royal governors); and they enjoyed the freest press of the eighteenth
   century. Like their British cousins, colonials celebrated their liberties,
   and the middle and lower classes - though excluded from formal political
   debates - effectively registered their views through street-crowd actions.
        America seemed exceptional, yet serious contradictions marked the
   developing society. Fundamental inequalities shaped colonial life and
   antagonisms were intensifying. Women's lives varied based on class and
   marital status, but all women suffered the restrictions of male
   domination. Colonials prided themselves on their liberties, but their
   economies depended upon denying freedom to others. To gain passage to
   America, poor white immigrants subjected themselves to indentured
   servitude. More cruelly, a vicious trade brought Africans to work as
   slaves and they numbered half a million. The rebelliousness of servants
   and slaves distressed their masters. And not far away lived the Native
   American peoples, determined to resist colonial expansion as best they
   could.
        Real inequalities also prevailed among free whites. Landlordism and
   tenantry spread, periodically inciting farmers to riot in protest.
   Property also shaped urban life. Wealthy merchants had built fortunes on
   transatlantic commerce. Together with the southern planters and northern
   landlords, they constituted provincial ruling classes and dominated
   colonial assemblies. Also, an intellectual elite of lawyers and prominent
   Protestant clergy developed in close connection to these ruling classes.
        Of course, the urban majority belonged to the working classes. The
   "master mechanics," owned their own shops and hired journeymen and
   apprentices. These skilled artisans were Tom Paine's folk. Literate and
   often interested in science and public affairs, they aspired to an
   independent livelihood and community respect, gained through hard work,
   moderation, and self-improvement. As well, they desired a greater role in
   public affairs.
        Below the artisans, propertyless laborers grew in number, including
   sailors, dockworkers, hired servants, and the unskilled. Though better off
   in America than in Britain, they well knew both that they lacked the
   rights of the propertied and that the rich were growing richer. Their
   rising sense of injustice, and readiness to express it, made their
   superiors nervous.
        Holding these diverse colonials together, and binding them to the
   empire, was their shared sense of "Britishness" (though not all were
   actually British or even of British descent). Like their British
   counterparts, they believed they enjoyed rights which other peoples did
   not - rights secured through the ages and assured by the English
   Constitution. Ironically, the very demands of the British Empire would
   soon wear away at the colonials' attachments to Britain and its
   institutions.
        Britain's triumph in the Seven Years War - known to us as the French
   and Indian War (1756-63) - drove the French from Canada and secured
   British domination of North America and the Atlantic world. But victory
   and supremacy had a high price, exhausting the treasury and forcing the
   British Government to raise taxes and seek additional sources of income.
        King George III and his chief financial minister, George Grenville,
   logically assumed that the costs of colonial security should be borne by
   the colonials themselves. The colonials did not share that assumption;
   they felt they had paid for the North American war with their blood.
        As well, the British Government sought to more effectively regulate
   American commerce, and to protect Native American treaty rights against
   white encroachment. The resulting policies instigated a series of imperial
   crises.
        In 1763, Grenville laid out a "Proclamation Line" along the
   Appalachian Mountains, which restricted white territorial expansion to the
   west. And during the next decade he and his successors announced a string
   of new taxes and regulations governing colonial commerce and
   administration: the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, the Quartering Act, the
   Declaratory Act, the Townshend Acts, the Tea Act, and the so-called
   Coercive or Intolerable Acts.
        The British Government believed that the (unwritten) English
   Constitution gave it the authority to make laws for the colonies, for all
   Englishmen were supposedly represented in Parliament whether or not they
   actually voted for its members. But most Americans believed that
   Parliament was acting in an arbitrary and unconstitutional way, and
   violating their rights as Englishmen by making laws without their active
   consent.
        Angered by events, colonial leaders delivered speeches and wrote
   pamphlets decrying tyranny and the threat to liberty. They rightly worried
   about agitating the colonial masses, for their own words and actions did
   just that. And, once mobilized, middle and lower-class folk grew less and
   less willing to defer to their "betters." They gathered in street
   protests; they hung figures in effigy; and they attacked British officials
   and their property.
        Colonial defiance made the system unworkable. But every time
   Parliament repealed its latest revenue-raising law, it turned around and
   enacted new taxes. In reply, the colonials staged boycotts and actions
   like the Boston Tea Party. Occasionally, such confrontations turned
   violent, as in the Boston Massacre, when British troops fired into a
   protesting crowd and killed several people.
        Resistance escalated. Colonials organized, first locally, then across
   colonial lines, creating groups like the Sons of Liberty and the
   Committees of Correspondence. By 1774, the dispute had become a full-blown
   imperial crisis. It came to a head when Parliament closed Boston Harbor
   and essentially placed Boston and the Massachusetts colony under siege.
   Outraged, the colonies sent delegates to Philadelphia for the First
   Continental Congress in September 1774. They promised aid to
   Massachusetts, called for a continental boycott of British goods, and
   issued a declaration against "taxation without representation." Meanwhile,
   militias trained more seriously and the "Minutemen" readied themselves.
   The British had united the colonials in rebellion.
        It was at this time that Paine sailed to America, landing in
   Philadelphia only weeks after the First Continental Congress adjourned.
   The eight-week voyage did not augur well for his future. The crossing was
   horrible, if not horrific. Following the usual seasickness, a deadly
   epidemic known as "ship fever," probably typhus, struck passengers and
   crew alike. When they finally docked on November 30, l774, Paine had to be
   carried ashore on a stretcher and spend the next few weeks recuperating.
        Given his past, Paine was remarkably fortunate (not just for having
   survived the journey). Traveling as a free man, with Franklin's letter of
   introduction and a bit of money in his purse, Paine's own status
   contrasted sharply with that of the majority of new arrivals. One hundred
   of the 120 passengers with whom he sailed came as indentured servants, and
   Philadelphia's Slave Market could easily be seen from his rented lodgings.
        In early January, Paine roused himself to get out and about. Though
   only a square mile in size, Philadelphia - with a fast growing population
   of 30,000 and America's busiest harbor - had emerged as the unofficial
   commercial and cultural capital of British North America. The city's
   prosperity and diversity clearly impressed him. Founded by William Penn, a
   Quaker, Pennsylvania had served as a haven for the Friends and
   Philadelphia reflected its Quaker heritage. Its European population
   included native and immigrant English Quakers, Anglicans and Catholics,
   German Lutherans and Mennonites, Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, and Jews.
        Philadelphia's politics also appealed to Paine. The merchant elite
   controlled economic affairs and colonial government. However, they faced
   challenges from below. The skilled mechanics resented the merchants'
   domination and they began to demand a direct role in government. Not only
   the wealthier artisans, but also the poorer mechanics and laborers,
   numbers of whom had enlisted in Pennsylvania's militia, started to demand
   rights of political participation. Such things thrilled Paine - and yet
   the paradox of white servitude and black bondage in the midst of a
   prosperous, liberty-loving and spirited people astounded him.
        As Franklin had directed, Paine first arranged to meet Richard Bache,
   who immediately took a liking to the new arrival and promised both to help
   him find employment as a children's tutor and to introduce him to the
   city's leading figures.
        Also, as he had in London, Paine quickly took to spending time in
   bookshops. One afternoon, the owner of his favorite shop, Robert Aitken,
   engaged him in conversation about his literary interests, leading Paine to
   show him several of his own writings. Aitken then amazed Paine by offering
   him the editorship of the Pennsylvania Magazine, a new periodical that he
   planned to co-publish with John Witherspoon, the president of the college
   of New Jersey (later renamed Princeton). Incredibly, only weeks off the
   ship, Paine had a new career as a journalist.
        The first issue appeared on January 24, 1775. The magazine
   flourished. Paine himself contributed essays, poems and scientific
   reports, written, as was the custom, under various pseudonyms, such as
   "Atlanticus," "Vox Populi," and "Justice and Humanity'"
        Expressing renewed optimism and a progressive view of the future,
   Paine developed a writing-style and a vocabulary that reflected the
   promise he sensed in American life. Notably, in his opening editorial he
   warned against "historical superiority" the idea that the present age
   represents the highest and final stage of history.
        Appreciating American possibilities, Paine also confronted America's
   contradictions. He criticized aristocratic and lordly pomposity. In one
   essay he considered the oppression of women. In yet another he vigorously
   aatacked slavery, calling for its abolition and insisting upon America's
   responsibility to support the slaves following emancipation. Not long
   after, Franklin returned to Philadelphia and established the first
   American Anti-Slavery Society with Paine as a founding member.
        Though Paine wrote critically of British imperialism, he continued to
   favor reconciliation. That is, until April I9, l775,when British troops
   opened fire on colonial militia at Lexington, Massachusetts leaving 8
   militiamen dead and 10 wounded. News of the battle - "the shot heard round
   the world" - turned Paine into an American patriot and radical. Forsaking
   his Quaker background, he now argued the legitimacy of violence in defense
   of liberty and, in the poetic verses of The Liberty Tree, he aligned
   himself with the American cause.
        Yet, what exactly was America's cause: The restoration of
   "Englishmen's rights"? The reform of the imperial system? or outright
   separation? Radicals - like Samuel Adams, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson
   - privately discussed separation but, publicly, they merely proposed
   reorganizing America's colonial relationship to Britain. And even that
   seemed too extreme to many.
        The PennsylvaniaMagazine prospered under Paine's editorship.
   Nevertheless, Paine's relations with his bosses soured by the summer of
   1775. Witherspoon turned against Paine for having the audacity to actually
   edit Witherspoon's words. In revenge, Witherspoon spread rumors that Paine
   drank heavily, a slur that would follow him to the grave. Paine did drink,
   mostly wine and brandy, but not at all to the extent his enemies claimed.
   At the same time, salary questions divided Paine and Aitken. Increasingly
   confident of his literary abilities, Paine had requested a raise. Aitken
   refused. In the autumn, Paine left the magazine.
        Paine quit not simply because he became fed up with his employer.
   More important, he had decided upon a new and very daring project: to
   write a pamphlet calling for separation from Britain.
        Ever since the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April l775, a
   state of war had prevailed. In May 1775, the Second Continental Congress
   had convened in Philadelphia and created a Continental Army under the
   command of George Washington. Still, peace overtures continued and
   American goals remained undefined. Tom Paine, the newcomer, would
   revolutionize American thinking.
        Paine's writings had started to garner significant attention and he
   had been befriended by one of Congress's more radical members, the young
   Philadelphia doctor, Benjamin Rush. When Paine told him of his writing
   plans, Rush counseled moderation, fearing the time was not yet right.
   However, Paine would not be deterred.  He was absolutely convinced that -
   although Americans did not speak openly of it - they yearned for
   independence. Whatever his reservations, Rush welcomed Paine's commitment
   and, in turn, Paine regularly sought his new friend's editorial advise.
        Starting in September 1775, Paine devoted his energies to producing
   the pamphlet. History beckoned, and he could not afford to hesitate.
   Determined to reach the broadest possible audience, he held nothing back.
    He summoned forth his memories of Britain and his affection for America.
   He drew upon his readings of eighteenth-century liberal and republican
   political thought- readings that emphasized individual freedom and
   contended that individuals constitute representative government to protect
   their rights to life, liberty and property. Paine articulated those ideas
   with his understanding of popular, democratic political aspirations. He
   quoted the Bible, he cited historical examples, and called upon the force
   of reason itself.
        After completing the manuscript in December, he sent copies to Sam
   Adams and Ben Franklin for their consideration. They liked it and
   suggested only minor revisions. Rush then introduced Paine to the
   Philadelphia publisher, Robert Bell, who, sympathetic to its arguments,
   accepted the (dangerous) commission of printing it. Paine wanted to call
   his pamphlet Plain Truth, but Rush proposed another title, Common Sense,
   and Paine listened.
       Oon January10, 1776, Common Sense swept onto the American scene and
   into American consciousness. In just two weeks the first printing sold
   out. Soon, supply could not keep up with demand. With or without
   permission, presses around the colonies issued new editions, including one
   in German for immigrants. During the next few months, 150,000 copies were
   distributed in America alone (the equivalent today would be 15,000,000 -
   making it, proportionately, the nation's greatest bestseller ever). And in
   very little time translations appeared in Europe.
        Paine originally signed his pamphlet "Written by an Englishman."
   However, within weeks folks had figured out who that Englishman was. Paine
   himself relished the attention, but he sought no material rewards. He
   declined all royalties, insisting that any profits be used to purchase
   mittens for Washington's troops.
        Paine wrote Common Sense to transform the colonial rebellion into a
   war for independence. But he did more than that.  He called upon Americans
   to recognize their historical possibilities and historic responsibilities.
   Harnessing their shared- but, as of yet, unstated - thoughts, and
   expressing them in language bold and clear, he urged them to make a true
   revolution of their struggles.
        He forcefully declared the American cause to be much more than a
   question of separation from Britain. Announcing that "The sun never shined
   on a cause of greater worth," he proclaimed it a campaign against the
   tyranny of hereditary privileges and for a democratic republic.
        Even before he issued the call for independence, Paine dealt with
   Americans' surviving emotional attachments to the King and Britain.
   Against those who reverently praised the benevolence of the English
   Constitution, he insisted that "it is wholly owing to the constitution of
   the people, and not to the constitution of the government that the crown
   is not as oppressive in England as in Turkey."
        Paine revealed the monarchy to be a ridiculous institution whose
   origins were anything but divinely ordained: "A French bastard [William
   the Conqueror] landing with an armed banditti, and establishing himself
   king of England against the consent of the natives, is in plain terms a
   very paltry rascally original. - It certainly hath no divinity in it...
   The plain truth is, that the antiquity of English monarchy will not bear
   looking into."
        Appealing to Americans' religious and egalitarian sentiments, he
   added that "hereditary succession" compounds the evil of monarchy: "For
   all men being originally equals, no one by birth could have a right to set
   up his own family in perpetual preference to all others for ever."
        He humorously observed that "One of the strongest natural proofs of
   the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it,
   otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving
   mankind an ass for a lion." And he charged that "monarchy and succession
   have laid (not this or that kingdom only) but the [whole] world in blood
   and ashes."
        Paine utterly rejected the proposition that Britain was America's
   "parent country." He described British conduct as selfish and shameful:
   "Even brutes do not devour their young, nor savages make war upon their
   families." If anything "Europe, not England, is the parent country of
   America," he contended: "This new world hath been the asylum for the
   persecuted lovers of civil and religious liberty from every part of
   Europe...we claim brotherhood with every European Christian..." Paine then
   turned to America. He appealed directly to Americans' economic interests.
   Yet, in addition to outlining their tremendous commercial prospects, he
   offered a vision of independence that asked them to see themselves as
   "Americans." He wrote so as to compel them to comprehend themselves as a
   people no longer subject to king and noble but - as was their "natural
   right" - free and equal before God and "the law" and governing themselves
   through democratically-elected representatives.
        Urging unity, Paine portrayed America, not as thirteen separate
   entities, but as a nation-state: "Now is the seed time of continental
   union, faith and honour...Our strength is continental not provincial." In
   favor of a republican government, he proposed a one-chamber Continental
   Congress headed by a rotating President. Finally, he surveyed America's
   physical and material riches to prove it had the resources to actually
   accomplish the revolution.
   Philosophers have argued about the originality of Paine's ideas. But one
   thing is certain: They were radically original in both appeal and
   consequence. Elite colonial intellectuals had penned many a speech and
   pamphlet, but they had narrowly addressed themselves to the upper classes.
        Paine - artisan by upbringing and intellectual by effort - addressed
   himself to Americans of all classes. The very style and content of his
   words entailed a more democratic conception of "the people" than had
   prevailed up to that time. Paine not only wrote so working people could
   understand, but also to integrate them into the political nation.
   Capturing the imagination of artisans and farmers in an unprecedented
   fashion, Paine recruited them to the cause of independence and encouraged
   them to restructure the political and social order. He devised a new, more
   democratic language of politics and way of arguing about politics than
   ever before had existed.
        Praising America's religious diversity, Paine connected the advance
   of religious freedom to the cause of independence and the creation of a
   new polity. America would serve as a model to the world and, welcoming of
   immigrants, as a refuge:
        O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only tyranny, but
   the tyrant, stand forth! Every spot of the world is over-run with
   oppression. Freedom hath been hunted round the globe. Asia and Africa have
   long expelled her. -Europe regards her like a stranger, and England hath
   given her warning to depart. O! receive the fugitive, and prepare in time
   an asylum for mankind.
        Paine's vision of a democratic republic was potentially unlimited.
   This point was well understood, not only by loyalist Tories who desired
   reconciliation with England and vehemently denounced Common Sense and its
   author. It was also well understood by elite-minded patriots like John
   Adams who, while pleased by the call for independence, spoke critically of
   Paine and his ideas because they feared the popular, radical-democratic
   aspirations that his pamphlet evoked.
        For Paine, the American Revolution possessed world-historical
   importance:" The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all
   mankind," he wrote. In fact, whereas before this time "revolution" had
   meant to merely "revolve," as in an orbit, hereafter it would mean to
   overthrow an old regime and create a new one.
        Weeks passed before anyone in the Continental Congress responded
   openly to Paine's arguments. Apparently, delegates did not know what to
   do. But they created a great commotion in other parts. In Virginia, Edmund
   Randolph observed that Common Sense "insinuated itself into the hearts of
   the people"; in Massachusetts, Deacon Palmer noted that "I believe no
   pages were ever more eagerly read, nor more generally approved. People
   speak of it in rapturous praise"; and in the field commanding the
   Continental Army, George Washington reported how Paine's pamphlet "is
   working a wonderful change in the minds of many men," adding that his own
   reading of it had finally persuaded him of the need to break with Britain.
        Reservations persisted. The propertied rich feared the new politics
   of the working classes, but most figured they would be better trying to
   lead than resist it. In the spring, colonial assemblies began to issue
   resolutions calling for independence and instructing their delegates at
   Philadelphia to follow suit. Finally, in June, Congress appointed a
   committee headed by Thomas Jefferson to draft an American Declaration of
   Independence. Paine was not a member of that committee, but all had read
   his Common Sense. And, on July 4,1776, the United States of America
   declared its independence. Paine's contributions to the making of the
   American Revolution - indeed, to the making of the Age of Revolution and
   the modern world - had only just begun. He would go on to write the
   invaluable American Crisis Papers, the radical-democratic Rights of Man,
   the freethinking Age of Reason, and the social-democratic Agrarian
   Justice. For good reason he remains a hero, most of all to radicals,
   socialists, and religious freethinkers.
        Paine clearly deserves a most prominent place in American memory. His
   words led the way in turning our rebellion into a war for independence,
   and our war for independence in to a revolution. Moreover, he helped to
   endow the nation's history with a radical-democratic impulse, one which
   would encourage not only eighteenth-century workingmen to refashion the
   nation, but also later generations of American men and women who have
   found themselves oppressed and marginalized.
        Contrary to the ambitions of our own powers that be: The stuggle for
   liberty, equality and democracy has not ended. I just hope we will
   continue to honor Paine, not only in our histories, but also in our
   politics.
