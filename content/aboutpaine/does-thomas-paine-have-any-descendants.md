   No. Paine was an only child, and he never had children (that survived).
   There have been several claims or beliefs from people thinking they are
   descendants because of similar names, or family mythologies. But none have
   borne out.  The claims center around three possibilities (all of which
   have been proven false): first, that from Paine's first wife, who died in
   childbirth, the child lived - but records show otherwise: both she and the
   child died; second, that Paine had siblings from his father's side, but no
   proof of that has been established. Even if established that would not be
   direct descendancy; and third, that Thomas Bonneville, the son of Madame
   Bonneville and her husband and comrade of Paine, Nicholas, was instead
   Paine's son - but Madame Bonneville filed suit against the author of that
   (an early biography written to slander Paine) and won based on court
   evidence close to that time period.  Other claims come from a confusion of
   the name Paine, some confusing Robert Treat Paine with him, who was,
   instead, not only unrelated, but a political enemy.
