   first President of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association

   The complete essay from the TPNHA Collection:

   Although pious legends picture Thomas Paine as terrified of death,
   his only fear was lest he should live too long, and suffer like his
   parents from helpless age. When at length death was plainly approaching
   his only dread was excited by the zealous aggressions of proselytizers,
   whose eagerness for some miraculous manifestations from heaven or hell, at
   the death bed of the famous deist was likely, he foresaw, to fabricate a
   fabulous fulfillment. He therefore sent for the widow of friend Elihu
   Palmer, who had been left in poverty, to watch beside him till his death.
   His next anxiety was lest fanatics, in their disappointment that he was
   neither converted nor carried off by Satan, should subject his body to
   indignities, and, his parents having been Quakers, he requested burial in
   the Friends' graveyard in New York. This was refused solely because of his
   deism, nothing whatever being alleged against his character. He was buried
   at New Rochelle on the farm presented to him by the State of New York at
   the close of the Revolution because of his services in that struggle.

    
   And even then Paine entered on his posthumous career. There was no
   Quaker formula against deism, and the refusal of a grave to Paine,
   resented by some members of that Society, began a controversy which as I
   believe resulted twenty years later in a split, and the establishment of
   the rationalistic Society now known as "Hicksite Quakers".
    
   A plain headstone was placed at Paine's grave, but bits of it were
   chipped away by visitors. A
   Fragment is sometimes shown at Paine's celebrations in New York, and the
   destruction of the headstone ascribed to orthodox vandalism. But Gilbert
   Vale, who in 1837 edited The Beacon, said in that paper that it was done
   by "admiring visitors". In his paper of July 15, 1837, Vale says: "After
   Cobbett violated the grave, and removed the bones from the remains of
   Paine, the headstone  as broken, and pieces successively removed by
   different visitors; one large fragment was preserved by a lady in an
   opposite cottage, in which Mr. Paine had sometimes boarded; but this
   fragment gradually suffered diminution, as successive visitors begged a
   piece of what they could no longer steal. To preserve the last remnant the
   lady has had it plastered up in a wall." The cottage alluded to is the
   Bayeaux house, and the lady Mrs. Badeau, who lived there with her mother,
   the widow Bayeaux, when Paine was a boarder. Her son, Mr. Albert Badeau,
   whom I visited in New Rochelle in 1891, preserved various relics of Paine.
   He saw Cobbett's workmen digging up Paine's bones about dawn.
    
   In September 1819 Cobbett wrote from America a public letter to Lord
   Folkstone in which he advised him to read Paine's "Decline and Fall of the
   British System of Finance": "and then blush at the use of the words 'Lower
   Orders'; blush to think that this man, born in humble life, knew more than
   all the 'higher orders' put together. Yet while such a fellow as pensioned
   Johnson, 'that slave of state', stands in colossal marble in St. Paul's,
   Paine lies in a little hole under the grass and weeds of an obscure farm
   in America. There, however, he shall not lie, unnoticed, much longer. He
   belongs to England. His fame is the property of England; and if no other
   people will show that they value that fame, the people of England will.
   Yes, my Lord, among the pleasures that I promise myself, is that of seeing
   the name of Paine honoured in every part of England, where base corruption
   caused him, while alive, to be burnt in effigy. Never will England be what
   it ought to be until the marble of Pitt's monument is converted into a
   monument to the memory of Paine."
    
   In the same month the remains were dug up. "Our expedition", wrote
   Cobbett, "set out from New York in the middle of the night; got to the
   place (twenty-two miles off) at peak of day; took up the coffin entire;
   and just as we found it, goes to England. Let it be considered the act of
   the Reformers of England, Scotland and Ireland. In their name we opened
   the grave, and in their name will the tomb be raised." (Cobbett's Register
   xxxv. P.382.) According to The Beacon (Dec. 27,1845) a little finger of
   Paine was left in America, and was "in the possession of a friend
   <?Quaker> on Long Island."
    
   In Manordes's "Biographical Treasury" it is said, "Many however assert
   that Cobbett did not take that trouble, but brought over from America the
   remains of a criminal who had been executed." There is not however the
   slightest room for doubt on this point. Not only did Mr. Albert Badeau of
   New Rochelle witness the removal of the coffin, but the grave itself long
   bore the like witness. Dr. Clair J. Grece of Redhill has sent me an
   extract from a diary kept by his uncle Danial Constable while in America,
   who visited the grave on July 26,1822, and says "The grave is surrounded
   by a stone wall 16 feet by 12 and l8 inches thick, about 4 feet high. The
   grave is sunk in about the depth of a coffin. Some of the neighbors aided
   the three men who came with a wagon a little before day. They say had the
   proper authorities had known in time they would prevented the outrage."
    
   An aged Quaker informed me that a number of "Friends" who were on the
   "Elizabeth" when Cobbett came aboard with the big box, at New York, left
   the ship on learning its contents; but those who looked for a striking
   judgment on the vessel were disappointed. Cobbett with his strange freight
   landed at Liverpool on November 21,1819.
    
   Before relating the adventures of Paine's bones it may be of interest
   to record that the project of a monument to Paine at New Rochelle
   originated in 1837 with Gilbert Vale, who compiled a biography of Paine,
   and Mrs. Badeau, who, with her mother Mrs. Bayeaux, - both orthodox, -
   preserved an affectionate memory of the author and his sojourn as a
   boarder in their home at New Rochelle. The graceful monument was designed
   by John Frazee, an eminent architect, gratuitously, and was constructed at
   James's marble works in New Rochelle. The portrait was cut from a medal of
   the time, owned by a Mr. Gill and is - or was- a good likeness. The
   monument is not exactly over the grave but near its head. The farmer into
   whose hands the surrounding land had passed would not permit the committee
   to reach the twelve square feet which had been reserved inviolably for
   Paine's grave, by Madame Bonneville, so they had to purchase, at a cost of
   $50, twenty square feet of ground at the corner of the road and the lane
   leading to Paine's house. The largest subscription for the monument was
   that of Hiram Parker, $30, the others having mostly one dollar each. The
   total cost, including the land, was $1,634. The monument was erected in
   November 1839, in the presence of about fifty persons, but without any
   formalities or speeches.
    
   The reaction caused by the French Revolution was beginning to subside
   when Cobbett brought to England the bones of its famous outlaw, who, the
   Attorney General had declared in 1792, should never enter the country
   again except in vinculis. The "Painites" were reviving interest in their
   hero, and Richard Carlile had just been sent to prison for publishing the
   "Age of Reason". And by the way, soon after his arrival Cobbett visited
   Carlile in gaol: the prisoner said "Ah, had I been in America, they would
   not have thrown me in prison." "No", replied Cobbett, "they would have
   tarred and feathered you."
    

   Cobbett's enterprise was met with mingled wrath and ridicule. Probably
   most people now have no association with the incident except the four
   lines of Byron (following an equally cynical epitaph on Pitt) in a letter
   to Moore, from Ravcuna, Jan. 2,1820

   "In digging up your bones, Tom Paine,
   Will Cobbett has done well:
   You visit him on earth again,
   He'll visit you in hell."
    
   "Pray", adds Byron, "let not these versiculi go forth with my name
   except among the initiated, because my friend H. has foamed into a
   reformer, and I greatly fear will subside into Newgate." Even while the
   poet was writing, his friend H. - John Cam Hobhouse - was already in
   Newgate. It was for a pamphlet on Lord Erskine, so severely contrasting
   his earlier with his reactionary position, that it must almost have seemed
   to summon Paine as a Banquo at the feast of his once noble defender, but
   afterwards ennobled prosecutor. In fact Byron, in his Southern retreat,
   interested only in his alter ego Don Juan, was little aware of the
   political situation in England, and took the laughter over Paine's bones
   to be more genuine than it was. The merriment was not that of the Tories,
   but rather an effort of the old Whigs to hooh-pooh an incident fallen at
   the most serious crisis since the French Revolution.
    
   In August had occurred the terrible suppression of the mass meeting
   at Manchester ("Peterloo"). The trials of the Carliles and other heretical
   publishers and writers were filling the radicals with consternation. The
   storm was rising concerning Queen Caroline around whom the liberals were
   gathering with intense wrath against the Prince Regent whose full reign
   was at hand. Eight days after the arrival of Paine's bones at Liverpool
   three different Bills were introduced into Parliament, all heavily loaded
   guns aimed against the recovery by the people of rights lost during the
   French revolution - the Seditious Meetings Bill, the Training Prevention
   Bill, and the Blasphemous Libels Bill. The promoters of these measures
   were not slow in availing themselves of the Paine-Cobbett incident. On
   December2 Mr. Wilmot made a strong
   point of it in the House of Commons:
    
   "Does anybody advocate the principle of these meetings? If such a man
   exists it can only be in the person of the individual just returned from
   America, who has dug up the unhallowed bones of the blasphemer, and has
   brought them to this country for the purpose of creating a frenzied
   feeling in favour of his projects, and like old John Ziska, who desired
   that his skin be made into a drum to rouse his countrymen, wished to stir
   up impiety and disaffection by the exhibition of this mummery to the
   initated people of this country."
    
   After that, the Whig ridicule began, as if by mot d'ordre, and on
   December 17 a leading opponent of the government Bills, Earl Grosvenor,
   utilized the ridicule to prove them unnecessary:
    
   "To prove still further the feelings by which people are actuated, I
   beg leave to mention the way in which a posthumous production, the bones
   of Thomas Paine, has been treated in this country. The person by whom that
   vile experiment has been tried found that he had a little mistaken the
   feeling and character of the people of England. Was there ever any subject
   treated with more laughter, contempt, and derision than the introduction
   of these miserable bones, - whether the bones of Thomas Paine or not I
   will not undertake to decide."
    
   Mr. Edward Smith of Walthamstow, Cobbett's able biographer, does not
   share my suspicion that this ridicule was artificial. He says that Paine's
   religious heresies had obliterated his political ideas." In England he was
   known by his theology; and was branded as an Atheist by the hirelings who
   could not, or dare not try to refute him." He reproaches Cobbett for not
   knowing that such things do not strike or interest the English mind. But
   two years later the performance was imitated by the importation in a ship
   of what was left of the bones of Major Andre for burial in Westminster
   Abbey, and Cobbett wrote: "All the differences between me and the Duke of
   York is, that I bring home the bones of an Englishman famed throughout the
   world for his talents and writings; and that the Duke brings home the
   bones of one who was hanged as a spy." As for the ridicule, it was, apart
   from newspaper paragraphs, chiefly represented by some anonymous rhymes
   written with skill, but with an affectation of rudeness, and printed in
   the cheapest form. The date of the first effusion in December1 819, about
   three weeks after the bones were heard of in London, and it was entitled,
   "The Political House that Jack Built". In a picture Cobbett is seen
   in a boat marked "Rights of Man", seated on a coffin, and rowed by two
   Negroes.
    
   "B is a boat that used to ply
   Across the Brooklyn Ferry;
   To Market Slip that's called the Fly,
   A pretty kind of wherry.
    
   "And 'tis constructed on a plan
   That's best to cut the waves:
   The name of it is rights of man,
   And rowed by Negro slaves.
    
   "This boat Bill Cobb hired for a week,
   And entered on a trip,
   A passage over sea to seek
   In Merchant Brig or Ship
    
   "A coffin with him too he took
   When Paine's Bones lay in state,
   And tried each bark from Sandy Hook,
   In vain - quite to Hell's Gate.
    
   "And thither was his utmost scope,
   Nor farther has he been;
   The massive door refused to ope
   Just yet - to let him in."
    
   Another piece is headed "sketches of the Life of Billy Cobb and the death
   of Tommy Pain". The woodcut here shows Cobbett under an apple tree, his 
   hat on the ground full of apples, with Paine's skeleton on one side seizing
   him by the throat, and on the other the Devil touching him on the shoulder. 
   The muses tell that when Paine was dying the Devil appeared and said his 
   skull was now to be buried "for ever and ever."
    
   "One boon and only one I crave",
   Said Thomas with a sigh,
   "Let it be till there pass my grave
   A caitiff worse than I."
    
   The Devil thinks it quite safe to agree to this, but when Cobbett
   touches the grave Paine springs up, and attacks him on old scores, for
   Cobbett had reproduced "Oldys"' libels in America, and was connected to
   Painism only in after years. The Devil is at first rather pleased with the
   fight, being afraid that he may be "superceded" on his throne by one of
   them, but finally he reconciles them in view of the mischief they can do
   in England. Another woodcut shows Cobbett, coffin on shoulder; and next we
   see the ship.
    
   "E for Elizabeth doth stand
   And that's a vessel's name,
   That lately sailed from Yankey-Iand
   And to the Mersey came."
    
   Another hand identified in Notes and Queries, Feb. 29, 1868 as Thomas
   Rodd, Sr., ("John English" is the pseudonym) wrote an "Ode on the Bones of
   the Immortal Thomas Paine, newly transported from America to England by
   the no less immortal William Cobbett, Esq. Hic labor hic opus. Great Paine
   for little trumpery." (4 to pp 8). This privately printed poem (now very
   rare) tries at points to be satirical, without much success; it is severe
   on Paine's theological negations, but discloses a certain admiration for
   the arch-heretic. I quote a specimen:
    
   "No Judge or Jury does he fear,
   Nor e'en the Attorney General's frown
   Nor dread lthuriel with his spear
   Can knock this doughty Champion down.
    
   'Tis cowardice to strike the slain,
   'Tis cowardice to strike Tom Paine
   High high in dust the hero lies,
   And from his narrow box his face defies.
    
   Who shall the great Arch-Flamen be
   Of this new god? Upon whose shrine
   Let brass and farthing candles shine;
   His pen once gain'd the victory,
    
   And still victorious reigns, in spite
   Of all the Bishop could indite:
   None but the mighty hand of Law
   Against this daring Chief the quill could prosperous draw."
    
   Whether under more auspicious circumstances Cobbett could have
   received any enthusiasm for Paine can now be only a matter of conjecture.
   In 1820 George the Third, born in the same year with Paine, gave a fatal
   blow to all interest in his bones by dying on Paine's birthday, January
   29. Thenceforth popular feeling was entirely occupied with the sufferings
   of Queen Caroline and the affairs of George IV. Cobbett at once began his
   efforts to get into Parliament, and Paine's bones were stored away and
   forgotten for many a long year. It appears, however, that he occasionally
   exhibited the bones. The Rev. Gerald Davies, of Charterhouse, wrote to the
   "Surrey Times", Feb. 2, 1889, that he was told by the late James Wyatt, of
   Bedford, geologist, that in boyhood, being at Normandy Farm, Cobbett's
   last residence, he said, "Is it true you keep the bones of Tom Paine, the
   infidel?" Cobbett replied, "What do you know about Tom Paine?"
   But he took the boy up stairs and showed him the bones. William Cobbett
   dies June 18, 1835, at Normandy Farm, near Guilford. His son J.P. Cobbett
   found himself unable to pay off his father's debts and his own, and the
   effects were sold by Thomas Piggott at auction in the autumn of the same
   year, on the premises. This information was communicated to the "Surrey
   Times", Jan. 19, 1889,b y D.M. Stevens, who adds:
    
   "My informants, who were present at the sale, told me that a box was
   pointed out as containing the remains of Paine, and they believed that the
   box and its contents were described in the catalogue, and that some
   allusion being made to the fact, the auctioneer refused to bring the lot
   under the hammer. What eventually became of the box and its contents is an
   unsolved problem, and, notwithstanding my own efforts to solve it, had
   better to remain so. The whole subject is a painful one, and I have no
   doubt that Cobbett, of whom we Surrey men have abundant reason to be
   proud, often regretted that he had not left the noted Freethinker's bones
   to remain in their original American resting-place."
    
   Gilbert Vale, who was in correspondence with English freethinkers,
   stated in "The Beacon", Dec.27, 1845, "The bones fell into the hands of an
   elderly female, a nurse in Cobbett's family, and by her given or sold to
   Lta King's gardener.'" Lord King, who died two years before Cobbett, was a
   nobleman who held many opinions in common with Paine. His residence,
   Ockham, was not far from that of Cobbett.
    
   I have a letter (autograph) written by Gilbert Vale, Aug. 20, 1860,
   in which he says: "Cobbett did take the bones of Paine to London: they are
   in the hands of the friends of Paine, who will one day put a monument up
   to him. I saw some of the parties in charge of them in 1848, and I have a
   pamphlet on the subject which I suppose I brought from England in that
   year."
    
   The pamphlet was: "A Brief History of the Remains of the late Thomas
   Paine, from the time of their disinterment in 1819 by the late William
   Cobbett M.P., down to the year 1846. London: J. Watson, 1847" pg.8.
    
   I was acquainted with James Watson, and gave the address at his
   burial, in 1874. He was an able and exact man, and as he no doubt wrote
   the pamphlet himself, the following statements in it were undoubtedly
   those Watson received from Benjamin Tilly, - a tailor, and a factotum of
   Cobbett in London. According to the pamphlet Cobbett brought the
   coffin-plate, inscribed "Thomas Paine, died June 8, 1809, aged74 years."
   (Both Watson and Tilly would certainly know that laine was- born January
   29, 1737, and this pres6rvation of an error as to his age, probably due to
   Madame Bonneville who ordered the coffin, is a certificate of the
   genuineness of this plate, which must still be in existence.) Cobbett
   placed Paine's remains for a short time "in the keeping of a well known
   friend of his in Hampshire" (Lord King?), but they were brought to London,
   and remained in Cobbett's house, Bolt Court, until January 1833, when
   Tilly sent them to Normandy Farm. There they remained until Cobbett's
   death (June 18, 1835). James Paul Cobbett (his son and executor) inscribed
   his own name in several places on the skull, and on the
   larger bones. This gentleman was charged with insolvency by one Jesse
   Oldfield, who had been his father's shopman, and the litigation resulted
   in the appointment of a receiver for the Normandy Farm estate, George
   West, a neighboring farmer. In January 1836, when Cobbett's effects were
   sold at his Farm, the auctioneer refused to offer Paine's remains, and
   they were retained by the receiver to await the orders of the Lord
   Chancellor, who, on the subject being mentioned to him in Court, refused
   to recognize them as part of the estate, or to make any order. Georgel
   West's receivership ended in 1839. After keeping Paine's remains nine
   years, he ascertained that Tilly wished to carry out Cobbett's intentions
   concerning them, and he therefore, saysW atson, conveyed them in March,
   1844, to Mr. Tilly (13 Bedford Square, East, London) "by whom they will in
   all probability be kept, until a public funeral of them can be arranged."
    
   In "Notes & Queries", January 25, 1868, a writer signing "A Native of
   Guilford" states that in the summer of 1849 he saw Paine's bones in a box
   in the house of John Chennell, corn merchant in Guilford, who told him
   that they had been purchased at the Cobbett sale at Ash by someone
   ignorant of the contents of the chest. A writer in the "Surrey Times",
   January 19, 1889, states that the same merchant, Chennell, possessed a
   porcelain jar, with parchment cover inscribed "The GreatP aine's Bones",
   but that "only a few bones were inside the jar". To this the Surrey editor
   adds:  A correspondent from the United States was assured that in 1849
   they were lying in the cellar of Mr. Chennell's house, and inquiries are
   being anxiously made  in the States for any authentic information as to
   them.." This American correspondent had probably got his information from
   the "Native of Guilford" in "Notes & Queries", which can hardly be
   correct. It does not harmonize with the porcelin jar story, and the latter
   is inexact; the sale was not at Ash, but on the Normandy Farm premises.
   Chennell may have kept the remains for some years for the receiver George
   West, but if any were there in 1849 it could only have been a few of the
   bones which, as will presently appear got separated from the rest. In that
   year they were seen in possession of Benjamin Tilly.
    
   About 1860 Tillv died in the house of a Mr. Ginn, wood-merchant,
   Bethnal Green, and left with him a number of Cobbett's MMS. and Paine
   relics, but apparently without careful information. According to a
   statement made to me by Mr. George Reynolds of 23 Stepney Green, his
   attention was called to these relics in 1879 by a daughter of Mr. Ginn,
   who was a member of the Baptist Church of which he (Reynolds) was then
   minister. He purchased the box of papers and relics which proved to be the
   MSS. Of Cobbett,  and some of the brain and hair of Paine, of which Mr.
   Reynolds is still in possession. From these papers he ascertained that
   Tilly had owned Paine's skeleton, and he at once inquired about it. Mrs.
   Ginn said that in cleaning the room after Tilly's death she found a lot of
   bones in a large bag and sold them to a rag-and-bone collector. Mr. Reynolds
   says she did not appear to know they were human bones. Mr. Ginn, however, 
   knew they were human, and said it was "a skeleton with the exception of 
   the skull and leg or arm."
    
   On hearing this story of Mrs. Ginn it struck me that there was an
   accent of sophistication about it. The rag-and-bone collector must have
   known they were-human bones, if she did not. She may have expected to gain
   some credit with the Baptist pastor for having turned the remains of "Tom
   Paine" into more rubbish and dust. I have since discovered that her story
   is not true, and also, what Mr. Reynolds did not know, that the skull and
   right hand of Paine had indeed, before Tilly's death, been removed and
   gone on a career of their own.
    
   It is probable that Tilly never. knew that any of the bones had been
   removed from the box. Mr. Joseph Cowen (of the "Newcastle Chronicle")
   tells me that about 1853-54 he was consulted by James Watson concerning
   the propriety of a public burial of Paine's bones at Kensal Green. Watson
   said they were in the possession of a tailor who kept them in a box on
   which he sat while at work.. Mr. Cowen went with Watson to the shop of the
   tailor who however was not at home. On his next visit to London he again
   went to the place, but the tailor had removed without leaving any address.
   Mr. Cowen says it was in the neighborhood of Red Lion Square, and he does
   not remember he name; but it was no doubt Tilly, who might have been
   temporarily working in that neighborhood. Mr. Cowen never heard of the
   matter again, but he remembers asking James Paul Cobbett about the bones,
   and finding that he knew not what had become of them, and evidently did
   not wish to talk on the subject.
    
   In December 1874 I inserted in the "National Reformer" an inquiry
   concerning Paine's remains. I received the same week a note from Mr. James
   Dickens of Denham Vila, Guilford, who said that he had made inquiries
   there, but could only learn that at the Cobbett sale "there was no bidder"
   for the box and its contents. My inquiry, however, was taken up, and Mr.
   J. Darbyshire of Manchester, in a letter of September 18, 1875, to "The
   Secular Chronicle" (London) suggested that "Messrs. Bradlaugh, Watts, G.L.
   Holyoake, Foote, Mrs. Law and Mrs. Besant, and others should be requested
   to look after the remains of Thomas Paine and conduct a public funeral,
   and that a monument be erected over his grave." Mr. Darbyshire was "sure
   that sufficient cash would be obtained for so good an object." Therein he
   was no doubt right, but Paine's remains were not discovered.
    
   Meanwhile, however, a lecture I gave in London in 1876 on Thomas
   Paine attracted the attention of Edward Truelove, the veteran publisher
   rationalist literature, who wrote me (Dec. 2,1876) that in 1853 or 1854
   the Rev. Robert Ainslie came into his shop in the Strand, and observing
   Paine's Works "volunteered the very startling information that he, the
   Rev. Robert Ainslie - of all men! - had in his possession the skull and
   right hand of Thomas Paine, but did not say how he came by them, evading
   my question."
    
   Mr. Ainslie was not aware that Mr. Truelove knew his name, but the
   bookseller recognized him as the Secretary of the London City Mission,
   under whose auspices many years before a course of lectures had been given
   in Eagle Street Chapel against "Infidel Socialism". Mr. Ainslie gave one
   of the lectures, and Mr. Truelove was naturally startled that any remains
   of Paine should have fallen into such orthodox hands. However, he did not
   mention to Mr. Ainslie that he recognized him. But on a later occasion,
   when the minister again entered his shop (removed to Holborn) he asked him
   what had become of Paine's bones, and his question was not answered.
    
   Mr. Ainslie probably became the owner of Paine's skull and right hand
   before George West brought the box to Benjamin Tilly. His daughter
   Margaretta (first wife of the late Sir Russell Reynolds) having received
   an inquiry of mine addressed to her father (1877) who died before it
   arrived, answered:
    
   "Mr. Thomas Paine's bones were in our possession. I remember them as
   a child, but I believe they were lost in the various movings which my
   father had some years ago. I can find no trace of them, but if I do by
   more inquiries."
    
   I heard nothing more from Mrs. Russell Reynolds, and she died in 1880.
   The late Sir Russell Reynolds had, as he lately wrote me, "an obscure 
   recollection of having seen the bones of a hand a great many years ago."
   As Margaretta Ainslie was married in 1852, her childhood recollections 
   probably extended into the years preceding 1844, when Watson says the 
   bones were brought to London. This marriage took place at Fromer House, 
   Bromley, Kent, where Mr. Ainslie resided at the time, and it is not
   Improbable that his near neighbor, Charles Darwin, inspected the skull of
   his predecessor in heresy. But it is a more picturesque reflection that
   eventualities should have brought Paine's skull back to the vicinity of
   his favourite haunt, -the so-called "Tom Paine Tree", an ancient oak in
   the grounds of the old Bishop's Palace.
    
   As this tree has not, I believe, been mentioned in any book, it may
   interest the reader to know that there is such a tree, and that it is said
   by long tradition to be the favourite resort of Paine while writing the
   "Age of Reason". I recently visited the tree, in company of Mr. Coles
   Childs, present owner of Bromley Palace. The trunk, about 25 feet in girth
   at the ground, is entirely hollow, but the foliage is ample, and there is
   hardly a dead branch. As a matter of history Paine did pass some time in
   Bromley, and a very intelligent watchmaker there, Mr. How, told me that he
   remembers his aged father pointing out the rather handsome residence,
   "Church Cottage", as that in which Paine resided. There is no evidence
   that Paine wrote any part of the "Age of Reason" at Bromley, but it is not
   improbable. In my historical introduction to the "Age of Reason", just
   published, I have shown that parts were written long before its
   publication; the subject was always near his heart, and he was fond of 
   discussing it with his neighbors. In the early months of 1792 Paine was 
   residing with his publisher, Clio Rickman, at 7 Upper Marylebone Street 
   (still a bookbinding with the old bookshelves remaining), where the swarming 
   of radicals left too little leisure for writing. "Mr. Paine goes out of town
   tomorrow to compose what I call Burke's funeral sermon", says John Hall in
   his diary, April 20,1792. This was at Bromley, where, on May l4, he heard
   of the summons of the publisher of "Rights of Man", and hastened to
   London, and claimed the right to stand in the publisher's place. He then
   doubtless resumed work at Bromley, and one may indulge the  picturesque
   legend that there in "Church Cottage", which was ecclesiastical property,
   and beneath the giant oak on the bishop's grounds, this heresiarch worked
   on the book that was to shake temples. From the "Tom Paine Tree" one may
   almost see Down homestead, where Darwin still more shook the temples,
   though the most venerable of them became his monument.
    
   The Rev. Robert Ainslie had a brother who was an eminent veterinary
   surgeon, and in his professional or some other capacity was, I am told, 
   connected with the estate of Lord King at Ockham, not far from Cobbett's 
   place. It was through him that the Rev. Robert Ainslie heard of Paine's 
   bones. His son. Mr. Oliver Ainslie, tells me that the remains were then 
   in the rooms of the auctioneer Richards( 43 Rathbone Place) "for sale", 
   and that the skull and right hand were there purchased by his father. 
   It is thus clear that all of the facts were not known to Tilly and Watson. 
   In Watson's pamphlet it is stated that the bones were brought up to London 
   by George West and given to Tilly, at 13 Bedford Square East. But Benjamin 
   Tilly's name does not appear at that place in the directories of the time; 
   indeed it does not appear at all until 1852. It seems possible that the 
   tailor had no such fixed residence as would carry as his name into the 
   directory, and that he confided the box of bones to the auctioneer Richards 
   until he had a house of his own. If so Richards, or some subordinate, may have
   abstracted th e skull and hand and sold them to Mr. Ainslie, Tilly
   remaining ignorant of the trespass. It is possible, however, that the
   skull and hand had been sold by West the receiver to Chennell of Guilford
   before the remains were brought to Tilly, who did not examine them. Mr. 
   Edward Smith tells me that he "interviewed" the son of Chennell in 1877, 
   and heard that Paine's bones had been sold, and brought 7s 6d. Mr. Truelove 
   says that when he told Watson that Ainslie had the skull he smiled in 
   credulously, yet amid all the tangle of conjectures the certainties are that 
   Tilly had the skeleton without the skull and right hand, a portion of the 
   brain and several pieces of hair, and that Ainslie possessed the cranium and
   right hand.
    
   Mr. Oliver Ainslie remarked that the smallness and delicacy of
   Paine's hand were such that the late Professor John Marshall, of the Royal
   College of Surgeons, at first thought it the hand of a female. "The head
   was also small for a man, and of the Celtic type I should say, and
   somewhat conical in shape, and with more cerebellum than frontal
   development." 'Some little time after his father's death the skull and
   hand were brought from 7l Mornington Road, where the Rev. Robert  Ainslie
   had resided, to Mr. Oliver Ainslie's house 48 Lincoln's Inn Fields, whence
   they were taken away by a Mr. Penny, to whom had been confided some
   arrangements of the room containing them for a new tenant. Mr. Oliver
   Ainslie became interested in the remains only when too late to save them,
   and has not been able to find Mr. Penny, nor does he know his full name.
   He fears that Penny may have disposed of the skull to one of the
   wastepaper dealers nearby. But this appears to me improbable. Every
   physician must possess a skull, which is worth more than a wastepaper
   dealer would pay. This skull of Paine also had the name of J.P. Cobbett
   written, or perhaps scratched, on it.  If an obvious remark may be
   forgiven, Mr. Penny would hardly be so pound foolish as to dispose of a
   skull so inscribed as mere rubbish, and it is probable that
   Paine's skull is now in some doctor's office or craniological collection.
    
   The Rev. Robert Ainslie, whom I met at Brighton in 1863, was a man of
   ability, and my conjecture would be that his purchase of Paine's skull may
   have been due to an interest in phrenology, were it not that he bought the
   hand also. Mr. George Jacob H lyoake tells me that he spoke to Mr. Ainslie
   about these bones, but that the minister did not wish his name publicly
   connected with them at the time. There were sufficient reasons for this,
   but they have long since passed away.
    
   Mr. Ainslie had been, it will be remembered, an official member of
   the City Mission, which consists of men belonging to different
   denominations, but has a reputation of being very strict about their
   orthodoxy. Mr. Ainslie's orthodoxy was assailed by some of his
   fellow-labourers in the City Mission, and though he warmly resented this
   at the time it would appear that his assailants saw the tendencies of some
   of his views more clearly than himself, for some years after the
   controversy he became (1860) minister of a liberal chapel at Brighton,
   where he remained until 1870. Mr. Ainslie had come into possession of
   Paine's skull some years before his orthodoxy was called in question, and
   the hue and cry might have been disagreeably renewed had it reached the
   public that while Secretary of the City Mission he had the bones of the
   terrible "Tom Paine" in his house.
    
   It appears certain that when he purchased the skull and hand, Mr.
   Ainslie was quite unconscious of any heretical symptoms. If it were
   admissible for Painites to believe in the potency of saintly relics they
   might point to the fact that Paine's skull fell into the hands of an
   orthodox member of the City Mission, and Paine's brain into those of an
   orthodox Baptist Minister (Rev. George Reynolds), and that both of these
   ministers subsequently became unorthodox.  And indeed it seems not
   improbable that these relics may have contributed something to the result,
   by exciting in the two divines some curiosity to know what thoughts had
   played through the lamp whose  fragments had come into their possession.
   And it is difficult for one who reads the "Age of Reason" to remain 
   precisely the simple believer he was before.
    
   That Paine's skull is still somewhere in London is highly probable,
   and were any found with the name "Cobbett" on it its genuineness could be
   easily proved by another word or two on it which for the present I
   reserve. As to the other remains of Paine's skeleton they were not
   destroyed, as Mrs. Ginn's story might imply, for they were seen in by the
   Rev. Alexander Gordon, now a Unitarian tutor at Manchester, in 1873, and
   heard of  in 1876. Although that gentleman gives no further particulars,
   the correspondence which has passed between us leaves no doubt on my mind
   that he was led by his respect for Paine (despite divergences from that
   author's religion) to secure for the remains quiet burial, - perhaps near
   his parents at Thetford. I find especial satisfaction in this belief since
   reading in the "New York World" (January 26,1896) the following statement:
    
   "Out in the country, somewhere back of New Rochelle, in a lonesome spot,
   there is a mound with a monument raised over it, and an inscription to the
   effect that the remains of Thomas Paine lie beneath that stone. If this is
   not true a great many worthy people are wasting their indignation, for the
   majority of those who pass the monument and know to whom it is erected,
   throw stones at it. Thus do Christians show their contempt for those whose
   opinions do not agree with theirs."
    
   This stone-throwing ceased, I believe, some years ago; the pious
   anti-Painites may have found that they were really adding to the author's
   cairn by attributing such importance to his writings long after those of
   his opponents were forgotten.
    
   Of the remains of Thomas Paine exhumed by Cobbett there are now
   traceable a portion of his brain and two locks of his hair. One of the
   latter was presented to me by Mr. Edward Smith, biographer of Cobbett.
   Paine's hair never became grey. The hair before me (on the old paper
   wrapping of which is written in Tilly's hand "Mr. Paine's Hair") is soft
   and dark, with a reddish tinge. The portion of Paine's brain owned by Mr.
   George Reynolds is about the size of one's fist, and quite hard. It is
   under glass and beside it is a note in Tilly's writing:
    
   "On Tuesday January 7th 1833 I went to 11 Bolt Court, Fleet Street,
   and there with Mr. Entrell and Mr. Dean, I saw, at the house of Mr.
   Cobbett, the remains of Mr. Thomas Paine, when I procured some of his
   hair, and from his skull I took a portion of his brain, which had become
   hard, and which is almost perfectly black. - B. Tilly"
    
   There are other personal relics of Paine. During the American
   revolution Paine wrote the fifth number of his "Crisis" at the house of 
   the Hon. William Henry at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and his spectacles 
   and shoe-buckles were left there. These were presented by a grand-daughter 
   of Mr. Henry to the National Museum at Washington, where I examined them. 
   The spectacles (silver) have small glasses of extraordinary power. Paine's 
   arm-chair and his brass and irons are in the possession of Albert Badeau at 
   New Rochelle. It is said that a walking cane of his exists but I cannot
   discover it. Mr. G.J. Holyoake has a copy of Paine's portrait (Sharp's
   engraving of Romney's picture) with the author's presentation to Rickman
   on it. Claire J. Grece, of Redhill, possesses Paine's snuff-box presented
   to his uncle, Daniel Constable, in 1807, by Paine. Edward Truelove
   possesses the writing-table used by Paine while in Rickman's house in
   1792. Alfred Hammond, of Lewes, possesses imprints of his (portrait) seal
   while an exciseman in that town, Louis Breeze, Stratford-by-Bow, has a
   piece of wood from the birthhouse of Paine, at Thetford, now destroyed. Of
   course there are many autograph letters of Paine, but no manuscript of
   anything he ever wrote for publication has been preserved.
    
   A considerable number of these relics were among the five hundred
   articles shown at the Paine Exhibition in South Place Chapel, openedD
   ecember 2 , 1895.There were also first editions of his works, and many
   polemical caricatures, books, and pamphlets called forth by these works;
   there were portraits of famous men - American, English, French - whose
   swords were unsheathed to maintain or assail the republic of Paine's
   vision, with its rainbow flag; but most impressive of all was the darkened
   bit of brain whence radiated the inner light of that miraculous Thetford
   Quaker.
    
   If we pass from personal relics to relics of personality, those of
   Paine are innumerable; and among these the most important are the legends
   and fictions told concerning him by enemies, unconscious that their
   romances were really tributes to his unique influence. Nothing concerning
   Paine seems to have been too marvelous for acceptance, in the past, and
   even in our own time one occasionally meets with inventions suggesting a
   certain praeternaturalism in his character. Thus on September 21, 1895,a
   London journal, "Answers", gravely published as a genuine autograph letter
   of Paine's, in the possession of one of its Dublin readers, the following,
   said to be addressed to a linendraper at Chelmsford:
    
   "Chapter Coffee House
   
   London, May 8th, 1793
   
   "Sir, - in perusing the Chelmsford paper I see you are a vendor
   of Fleecy Hosiery, and as you are a man after my own heart,
   a Leveller and a Talker of Treason, please to send six pair of
   the above Fleecy Hosierie to me at Chapter, and I will send you
   the money.
   Yours, Tom Paine."
   

   I wrote to the editor asking to be put into communication with the
   owner of this letter signed "Tom(!) Paine", and written more than seven
   months after Paine had left England forever, but he could not do so -of
   course.
    
   I must venture to repeat here, though it is mentioned in my edition
   of the "Age of Reason", a legend told me by Mr. Van der Weyde, the eminent
   London photographer, who remembers when a boy a sermon in which the
   preacher said that Tom Paine was so wicked that he could not be buried.
   The earth would not hold him. His bones were placed in a box and carried
   about from one place to another, until at last they came into the hands of
   a button-maker, and now his bones are traveling about the world in the
   form of buttons! This variant of the Wandering Jew legend recalls to me a
   verse which William Allingham added with pen to his admirable poem "The
   Touchstone" in a volume in my possession. The original poem, it will be
   remembered, closes with burning the formidable man's touchstone, and
   strewing the ashes on the breeze, little guessing that each grain of these
   `conveyed the perfect charm.' The manuscript addition is:
    
   "North, South, in the rings and amulets,
   Throughout the crowded world 'tis borne,
   Which, as a fashion long outworn,
   Its ancient mind forgets. "
