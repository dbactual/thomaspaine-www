   Thomas Paine is the only Founder without a gravesite. The story of his
   remains reflect the collossal life and works of Paine himself and his
   legacy.  He was first buried in New Rochelle, NY on his farm, after the
   Quakers refused him, in a town very hostile to him.  A Paine admirer,
   William Cobbett, himself a democratic advocate from England, saw the
   disrespect Paine received where he was buried and decided to dig him up
   and take him to England to help spur the movement for democracy there. He
   did that in 1819. Over the years, the bones were split up; there were
   unverified rumors that some of the bones were cut into buttons and sold to
   finance the revolution (but more buttons were sold than could have come
   from any 10 bodies). There are rumors of a leg bone in the wall of a
   tavern in England, some pieces were claimed in Europe, and it is probable
   that the skull has been located in Wales (and is now in Australia) but no
   testing has yet confirmed this.  We do know that a piece of the brain, and
   hair locks, from the body were secured by our Association.  But on the
   whole, Paine was scattered throughout the world and has no grave. Some
   believe this is fitting to the man's legacy, but Paine wanted specific
   gravesite arrangements which were never met.  Our Association hopes to
   recreate this gravesite where he wanted it in the future with the few
   remains that exist. For full details see the article here.
