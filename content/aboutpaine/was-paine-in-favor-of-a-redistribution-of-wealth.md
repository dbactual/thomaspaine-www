   Not only was he in favor of it, but the concept in modern times originates
   with him. Even in his early writings he makes reference to it, but in
   Rights of Man and Agrarian Justice it becomes a central tenet in his
   philosophy of government. Paine says that no one should live in a
   condition worse to that of life before civilization. Any one who does,
   (the poor, the infirm, the aged, the young starting out) must be
   compensated by the government for the loss of their natural right to the
   wealth of the land. He believed that wealth has been seized by the
   landlord and merchants classes from the classes that produce it (the
   mechanics and farmers). A progressive tax to redistribute that wealth was
   his solution.
