   Far from it. Paine had several occupations, most notably as an excise officer.
   However his abilities were used far beyond that position. For example, he
   was the only Councilman to serve in Lewes, England (an important commerce
   and redistribution center) for 6 straight years. This required political
   connections with the Whigs who controlled that area of southern England.
   He also had friends in the Whig aristocracy who would later provide boarding
   for him on his return to England in 1787. So he was hardly a failure. He
   was dismissed as an excise officer after leading their movement for labor
   rights, the price for standing up on principle which he continued
   throughout his life. These assertions of "failure" come from the same
   sources as many invented slanders, like drinking or being unkempt. And
   they are passed down by many writers and historians without real
   investigation. Unfortuneately, the progressive supporters of Paine had a
   hand in this disinformation - Howard Fast's Citizen Paine embraced the
   negative characterizations of Paine in an attempt to make him a working
   class hero. Recent research has shown that Paine was very well connected to the leading Whigs in the 1760s, and this is where he learned his craft of writing, with many essays being written by him in collaboration with these same Whigs.
