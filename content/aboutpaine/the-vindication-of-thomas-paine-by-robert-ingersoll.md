      "To argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason,
                is like administering medicine to the dead." -- THOMAS PAINE.

                                                                             

                                PEORIA, October 8, 1877.                     

   To the Editor of the N.Y. Observer:

   SIR: Last June in San Francisco, I offered a thousand dollars in gold --
   not as a wager, but as a gift -- to any one who would substantiate the
   absurd story that Thomas Paine died in agony and fear, frightened by the
   clanking chains of devils. I also offered the same amount to any minister
   who would prove that Voltaire did not pass away as serenely as the coming
   of the dawn. Afterward I was informed that you had accepted the offer, and
   had called upon me to deposit the money. Acting upon this information, I
   sent you the following letter:

                        Peoria, Ill., August 31st, 1877.                     

   To the Editor of the New York Observer:

   I have been informed that you accepted, in your paper, an offer made by me
   to any clergyman in San Francisco. That offer was, that I would pay one
   thousand dollars in gold to any minister in that city who would prove that
   Thomas Paine died in terror because of religious opinions he had
   expressed, or that Voltaire did not pass away serenely as the coming of
   the dawn.

   For many years religious journals and ministers have been circulating
   certain pretended accounts of the frightful agonies endured by Paine and
   Voltaire when dying; that these great men at the moment of death were
   terrified because they had given their honest opinions upon the subject of
   religion to their fellow-men. The imagination of the religious world has
   been taxed to the utmost in inventing absurd and infamous accounts of the
   last moments of these intellectual giants. Every Sunday school paper,
   thousands of idiotic tracts, and countless stupidities called sermons,
   have been filled with these calumnies.

   Paine and Voltaire both believed in God -- both hoped for immortality --
   both believed in special providence. But both denied the inspiration of
   the Scriptures -- both denied the divinity of Jesus Christ. While
   theologians most cheerfully admit that most murderers die without fear,
   they deny the possibility of any man who has expressed his disbelief in
   the inspiration of the Bible dying except in an agony of terror. These
   stories are used in revivals and in Sunday schools, and have long been
   considered of great value.

   I am anxious that these slanders shall cease. I am desirous of seeing
   justice done, even at this late day, to the dead.

   For the purpose of ascertaining the evidence upon which these death-bed
   accounts really rest, I make to you the following proposition: --

   First -- AS TO THOMAS PAINE: I will deposit with the First National Bank
   of Peoria, Illinois, one thousand dollars in gold, upon the following
   conditions: This money shall be subject to your order when you shall, in
   the manner hereinafter provided, substantiate that Thomas Paine admitted
   the Bible to be an inspired book, or that he recanted his Infidel opinions
   -- or that he died regretting that he had disbelieved the Bible -- or that
   he died calling upon Jesus Christ in any religious sense whatever.

   In order that a tribunal may be created to try this question, you may
   select one man, I will select another, and the two thus chosen shall
   select a third, and any two of the three may decide the matter.

   As there will be certain costs and expenditures on both sides, such costs
   and expenditures shall be paid by the defeated party.

   In addition to the one thousand dollars in gold, I will deposit a bond
   with good and sufficient security in the sum of two thousand dollars,
   conditioned for the payment of all costs in case I am defeated. I shall
   require of you a like bond.

   From the date of accepting this offer you may have ninety days to collect
   and present your testimony, giving me notice of time and place of taking
   depositions. I shall have a like time to take evidence upon my side,
   giving you like notice, and you shall then have thirty days to take
   further testimony in reply to what I may offer. The case shall then be
   argued before the persons chosen; and their decisions shall be final as to
   us.

   If the arbitrator chosen by me shall die, I shall have the right to choose
   another. You shall have the same right. If the third one, chosen by our
   two, shall die, the two shall choose another; and all vacancies, from
   whatever cause, shall be filled upon the same principle.

   The arbitrators shall sit when and where a majority shall determine, and
   shall have full power to pass upon all questions arising as to competency
   of evidence, and upon all subjects.

   Second. -- AS TO VOLTAIRE: I make the same proposition, if you will
   substantiate that Voltaire died expressing remorse or showing in any way
   that he was in mental agony because he had attacked Catholicism -- or
   because he had denied the inspiration of the Bible -- or because he had
   denied the divinity of Christ.

   I make these propositions because I want you to stop slandering the dead.

   If the propositions do not suit you in any particular, please state your
   objections, and I will modify them in any way consistent with the object
   in view.

   If Paine and Voltaire died filled with childish and silly fear, I want to
   know it, and I want the world to know it. On the other hand, if the
   believers in superstition have made and circulated these cruel slanders
   concerning the mighty dead, I want the world to know that.

   As soon as you notify me of the acceptance of these propositions I will
   send you the certificate of the bank that the money has been deposited
   upon the foregoing conditions, together with copies of bonds for costs.

                                  Yours truly,

                                         R.G. INGERSOLL.                     

   In your paper of September 27, 1877, you acknowledge the receipt of the
   foregoing letter, and after giving an outline of its contents, say: "As
   not one of the affirmations, in the form stated in this letter, was
   contained in the offer we made, we have no occasion to substantiate them.
   But we are prepared to produce the evidence of the truth of our own
   statement, and even to go further; to show not only that Tom Paine 'died a
   drunken, cowardly, and beastly death,' but that for many years previous,
   and up to that event he lived a drunken and beastly life."

   In order to refresh your memory as to what you had published, I call your
   attention to the following, which appeared in the N. Y. Observer, July 19,
   1877:

                              "PUT DOWN THE MONEY.

   "Col. Bob Ingersoll, in a speech full of ribaldry and blasphemy, made in
   San Francisco recently, said:

   "I will give a $1,000 in gold coin to any clergyman who can substantiate
   that the death of Voltaire was not as peaceful as the dawn; and of Tom
   Paine whom they assert died in fear and agony, frightened by the clanking
   chains of devils -- in fact frightened to death by God. I will give $1,000
   likewise to any one who can substantiate this 'absurd story' -- a story
   without a word of truth in it."

   "We have published the testimony, and the witnesses are on hand to prove
   that Tom Paine died a drunken, cowardly and beastly death. Let the Colonel
   deposit the money with any honest man, and the absurd story, as he terms
   it, shall be shown to be an ower true tale. But he won't do it. His talk
   is Infidel 'buncombe' and nothing more."

   On the 31st of August I sent you my letter, and on the 27th of September
   you say in your paper: "As not one of the affirmations in the form stated
   in this letter was contained in the offer we made, we have no occasion to
   substantiate them."

   What were the affirmations contained in the offer you made? I had offered
   a thousand dollars in gold to any one who would substantiate "the absurd
   story" that Thomas Paine died in fear and agony, frightened by the
   clinking chains of devils -- in fact, frightened to death by God.

   In response to this offer you said: "Let the Colonel deposit the money
   with an honest man and the 'absurd story' as he terms it, shall be shown
   to be an 'ower true tale.' But he won't do it. His talk is infidel
   'buncombe' and nothing more."

   Did you not offer to prove that Paine died in fear and agony, frightened
   by the clanking chains of devils? Did you not ask me to deposit the money
   that you might prove the "absurd story" to be an "ower true tale" and
   obtain the money? Did you not in your paper of the twenty-seventh of
   September in effect deny that you had offered to prove this "absurd
   story"? As soon as I offered to deposit the gold and give bonds besides to
   cover costs, did you not publish a falsehood?

   You nave eaten your own words, and, for my part, I would rather have dined
   with Ezekiel than with you.

   You have not met the issue. You have knowingly avoided it. The question
   was not as to the personal habits of Paine. The real question was and is,
   whether Paine was filled with fear and horror at the time of his death on
   account of his religious opinions. That is the question. You avoid this.
   In effect, you abandon that charge and make others.

   To you belongs the honor of having made the most cruel and infamous
   charges against Thomas Paine that have ever been made. Of what you have
   said you cannot prove the truth of one word.

   You say that Thomas Paine died a drunken, cowardly and beastly death.

   I pronounce this charge to be a cowardly and beastly falsehood.

   Have you any evidence that he was in a drunken condition when he died?

   What did he say or do of a cowardly character just before, or at about the
   time of his death?

   In what way was his death cowardly? You must answer these questions, and
   give your proof, or all honest men will hold you in abhorrence. You have
   made these charges. The man against whom you make them is dead. He cannot
   answer you. I can. He cannot compel you to produce your testimony, or
   admit by your silence that you have cruelly slandered the defenseless
   dead. I can and I will. You say that his death was cowardly. In what
   respect? Was it cowardly in him to hold the Thirty-Nine Articles in
   contempt? Was it cowardly not to call on your Lord? Was it cowardly not to
   be afraid? You say that his death was beastly. Again I ask, in what
   respect? Was it beastly to submit to the inevitable with tranquillity? Was
   it beastly to look with composure upon the approach of death? Was it
   beastly to die without a complaint, without a murmur -- to pass from life
   without a fear?

                            DID THOMAS PAINE RECANT?

   Mr. Paine had prophesied that fanatics would crawl and cringe around him
   during his last moments. He believed that they would put a lie in the
   mouth of Death.

   When the shadow of the coming dissolution was upon him, two clergymen,
   Messrs. Milledollar and Cunningham, called to annoy the dying man. Mr.
   Cunningham had the politeness to say, "You have now a full view of death
   -- you cannot live long, and whosoever does not believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ will assuredly be damned." Mr. Paine replied, "Let me have none of
   your popish stuff. Get away with you. Good morning."

   On another occasion a Methodist minister obtruded himself when Willet
   Hicks was present. This minister declared to Mr. Paine "that unless he
   repented of his unbelief he would be damned." Paine, although at the door
   of death, rose in his bed and indignantly requested the clergyman to leave
   his room. On another occasion, two brothers by the name of Pigott, sought
   to convert him. He was displeased and requested their departure. Afterward
   Thomas Nixon and Captain Daniel Pelton visited him for the express purpose
   of ascertaining whether he had, in any manner, changed his religious
   opinions. They were assured by the dying man that he still held the
   principles he had expressed in his writings.

   Afterward, these gentlemen hearing that William Cobbett was about to write
   a life of Paine, sent him the following note:

                               New York, April 24, 1818.                     

   "SIR: We have been informed that you have a design to write a history of
   the life and writings of Thomas Paine. If you have been furnished with
   materials in respect to his religious opinions, or rather of his
   recantation of his former opinions before his death, all you have heard of
   his recanting is false. Being aware that such reports would be raised
   after his death by fanatics who infested his house at the time it was
   expected he would die, we, the subscribers, intimate acquaintances of
   Thomas Paine since the year 1776, went to his house. He was sitting up in
   a chair, and apparently in full vigor and use of all his mental faculties
   We interrogated him upon his religious opinions, and if he had changed his
   mind, or repented of anything he had said or wrote on that subject. He
   answered, "Not at all," and appeared rather offended at our supposition
   that any change should take place in his mind. We took down in writing the
   questions put to him and his answers thereto before a number of persons
   then in his room, among whom were his doctor, Mrs. Bonneville, &c. This
   paper is mislaid and cannot be found at present, but the above is the
   substance which can be attested by many living witnesses."

                                           THOMAS NIXON.                     
                                          DANIEL PELTON.                     

   Mr. Jarvis, the artist, saw Mr. Paine one or two days before his death. To
   Mr. Jarvis he expressed his belief in his written opinions upon the
   subject of religion. B.F. Haskin, an attorney of the city of New York,
   also visited him and inquired as to his, religious opinions. Paine was
   then upon the threshold of death, but he did not tremble. He was not a
   coward. He expressed his firm and unshaken belief in the religious ideas
   he had given to the world.

   Dr. Manley was with him when he spoke his last words. Dr. Manley asked the
   dying man if he did not wish to believe that Jesus was the Son of God, and
   the dying philosopher answered: "I have no wish to believe on that
   subject." Amasa Woodsworth sat up with Thomas Paine the night before his
   death. In 1839 Gilbert Vale hearing that Mr. Woodsworth was living in or
   near Boston, visited him for the purpose of getting his statement. The
   statement was published in the Beacon of June 5, 1839, while thousands who
   had been acquainted with Mr. Paine were living.

   The following is the article referred to.

   "We have just returned from Boston. One object of our visit to that city,
   was to see a Mr. Amasa Woodsworth, an engineer, now retired in a handsome
   cottage and garden at East Cambridge, Boston. This gentleman owned the
   house occupied by Paine at his death -- while he lived next door. As an
   act of kindness Mr. Woodsworth visited Mr. Paine every day for six weeks
   before his death. He frequently sat up with him, and did so on the last
   two nights of his life. He was always there with Dr. Manley, the
   physician, and assisted in removing Mr. Paine while his bed was prepared.
   He was present when Dr. Manley asked Mr. Paine "if he wished to believe
   that Jesus Christ was the Son of God," and he describes Mr. Paine's answer
   as animated. He says that lying on his back he used some action and with
   much emphasis, replied, "I have no wish to believe on that subject." He
   lived some time after this, but was not known to speak, for he died
   tranquilly. He accounts for the insinuating style of Dr. Manley's letter,
   by stating that that gentleman just after its publication joined a church.
   He informs us that he has openly reproved the doctor for the falsity
   contained in the spirit of that letter, boldly declaring before Dr.
   Manley, who is yet living, that nothing which he saw justified the
   insinuations. Mr. Woodsworth assures us that he neither heard nor saw
   anything to justify the belief of any mental change in the opinions of Mr.
   Paine previous to his death; but that being very ill and in pain chiefly
   arising from the skin being removed in some parts by long lying, he was
   generally too uneasy to enjoy conversation on abstract subjects. This,
   then, is the best evidence that can be procured on this subject, and we
   publish it while the contravening parties are yet alive, and with the
   authority of Mr. Woodsworth.

                                           GILBERT VALE.                     

   A few weeks ago I received the following letter which confirms the
   statement of Mr. Vale:

                                    NEAR STOCKTON, CAL.,                     
                                      GREENWOOD COTTAGE,                     
                                           July 9, 1877.                     

   COL. INGERSOLL: In 1842 I talked with a gentleman in Boston. I have
   forgotten his name; but he was then an engineer of the Charleston navy
   yard. I am thus particular so that you can find his name on the books. He
   told me that he nursed Thomas Paine in his last illness, and closed his
   eyes when dead. I asked him if he recanted and called upon God to save
   him. He replied, "No. He died as he had taught. He had a sore upon his
   side and when we turned him it was very painful and he would cry out 'O
   God!' or something like that." "But," said the narrator, "that was
   nothing, for he believed in a God." I told him that I had often heard it
   asserted from the pulpit that Mr. Paine had recanted in his last moments.
   The gentleman said that it was not true, and he appeared to be an
   intelligent, truthful man. With respect, I remain, &c.,

                                     PHILIP GRAVES, M.D.                     

   The next witness is Willet Hicks, a Quaker Preacher. He says that during
   the last illness of Mr. Paine he visited him almost daily, and that Paine
   died firmly convinced of the truth of the religious opinions he had given
   to his fellow-men. It was to this same Willet Hicks that Paine applied for
   permission to be buried in the cemetery of the Quakers. Permission was
   refused. This refusal settles the question of recantation. If he had
   recanted, of course there could have been no objection to his body being
   buried by the side of the best hypocrites on the earth.

   If Paine recanted why should he be denied "a little earth for charity"?
   Had he recanted, it would have been regarded as a vast and splendid
   triumph for the gospel. It would with much noise and pomp and ostentation
   have been heralded about the world.

   I received the following letter to-day. The writer is well know in this
   city, and is a man of high character:

                                 PEORIA, Oct. 8th, 1877.                     

   ROBERT G. INGERSOLL, Esteemed Friend: My parents were Friends (Quakers).
   My father died when I was very young. The elderly and middle-aged Friends
   visited at my mother's house. We lived in the city of New York. Among the
   number I distinctly remember Elias Hicks, Willet Hicks, and a Mr. --------
   Day, who was a bookseller in Pearl street. There were many others, whose
   names I do not now remember. The subject of the recantation by Thomas
   Paine of his views about the Bible in his last illness, or at any other
   time, was discussed by them in my presence at different times. I learned
   from them that some of them had attended upon Thomas Paine in his last
   sickness and ministered to his wants up to the time of his death. And upon
   the question of whether he did recant there was but one expression. They
   all said that he did not recant in any manner. I often heard them say they
   wished he had recanted. In fact, according to them, the nearer he
   approached death the more positive he appeared to be in his convictions.

   These conversations were from 1820 to 1822. I was at that time from ten to
   twelve years old, but these conversations impressed themselves upon me
   because many thoughtless people then blamed the Society of Friends for
   their kindness to that "arch Infidel," Thomas Pain

                                  Truly yours.

                                         A.C. HANKINSON.                     

   A few days ago I received the following letter:

                       ALBANY, NEW YORK, Sept. 27, 1877.                     

   Dear Sir: It is over twenty years ago that professionally I made the
   acquaintance of John Hogeboom, a Justice of the Peace of the county of
   Rensselaer, New York. He was then over seventy years of age and had the
   reputation of being a man of candor and integrity. He was a great admirer
   of Paine. He told me that he was personally acquainted with him, and used
   to see him frequently during the last years of his life in the city of New
   York, where Hogeboom then resided. I asked him if there was any truth in
   the charge that Paine was in the habit of getting drunk. He said that it
   was utterly false; that he never heard of such a thing during the
   life-time of Mr. Paine, and did not believe any one else did. I asked him
   about the recantation of his religious opinions on his death-bed, and the
   revolting death-bed scenes that the world had heard so much about. He said
   there was no truth in them, that he had received his information from
   persons who attended Paine in his last illness, "and that he passed
   peacefully away, as we may say, in the sunshine of a great soul." ...

                                  Yours truly,

                                            W.J. HILTON.                     

   The witnesses by whom I substantiate the fact that Thomas Paine did not
   recant, and that he died holding the religious opinions he had published,
   are:

   First -- Thomas Nixon, Captain Daniel Pelton, B.F. Haskin. These gentlemen
   visited him during his last illness for the purpose of ascertaining
   whether he had in any respect changed his views upon religion. He told
   them that he had not.

   Second -- James Cheetham. This man was the most malicious enemy Mr. Paine
   had, and yet he admits that "Thomas Paine died placidly, and almost
   without a struggle." (See Life of Thomas Paine, by James Cheetham).

   Third -- The ministers, Milledollar and Cunningham. These gentlemen told
   Mr. Paine that if he died without believing in the Lord Jesus Christ he
   would be damned, and Paine replied, "Let me have none of your popish
   stuff. Good morning." (See Sherwin's Life of Paine, p. 220).

   Fourth -- Mrs. Hedden. She told these same preachers when they attempted
   to obtrude themselves upon Mr. Paine again, that the attempt to convert
   Mr. Paine was useless -- "that if God did not change his mind no human
   power could."

   Fifth -- Andrew A. Dean. This man lived upon Paine's farm at New Rochelle,
   and corresponded with him upon religious subjects. (See Paine's
   Theological Works, p. 308.)

   Sixth -- Mr. Jarvis, the artist with whom Paine lived. He gives an account
   of an old lady coming to Paine and telling him that God Almighty had sent
   her to tell him that unless he repented and believed in the blessed
   Savior, he would be damned. Paine replied that God would not send such a
   foolish old woman with such an impertinent message. (See Clio Rickman's
   Life of Paine.)

   Seventh -- Wm. Carver, with whom Paine boarded. Mr. Carver said again and
   again that Paine did not recant. He knew him well, and had every
   opportunity of knowing. (See Life of Paine by Gilbert Vale.)

   Eighth -- Dr. Manley, who attended him in his last sickness, and to whom
   Paine spoke his last words. Dr. Manley asked him if he did not wish to
   believe in Jesus Christ, and he replied, "I have no wish to believe on
   that subject."

   Ninth -- Willet Hicks and Elias Hicks, who were with him frequently during
   his last sickness, and both of whom tried to persuade him to recant.
   According to their testimony, Mr. Paine died as he had lived -- a believer
   in God, and a friend of man. Willet Hicks was offered money to say
   something false against Thomas Paine. He was even offered money to remain
   silent and allow others to slander the dead. Mr. Hicks, speaking of Thomas
   Paine, said: "He was a good man -- an honest man." (Vale's Life of Paine.)

   Tenth -- Amasa Woodsworth, who was with him every day for some six weeks
   immediately preceding his death, and sat up with him the last two nights
   of his life. This man declares that Paine did not recant and that he died
   tranquilly. The evidence of Mr. Woodsworth is conclusive.

   Eleventh -- Thomas Paine himself. The will of Thomas Paine, written by
   himself, commences as follows:

   "The last will and testament of me, the subscriber, Thomas Paine, reposing
   confidence in my creator God, and in no other being, for I know of no
   other, nor believe in any other;" and closes in these words; "I have lived
   an honest and useful life to mankind; my time has been spent in doing
   good, and I die in perfect composure and resignation to the will of my
   creator God."

   Twelfth -- If Thomas Paine recanted, why do you pursue him? If he
   recanted, he died substantially in your belief, for what reason then do
   you denounce his death as cowardly? If upon his death-bed he renounced the
   opinions he had published, the business of defaming him should be done by
   Infidels, not by Christians.

   I ask you if it is honest to throw away the testimony of his friends --
   the evidence of fair and honorable men -- and take the putrid words of
   avowed and malignant enemies?

   When Thomas Paine was dying, he was infested by fanatics -- by the snaky
   spies of bigotry. In the shadows of death were the unclean birds of prey
   waiting to tear with beak and claw the corpse of him who wrote the "Rights
   of Man." And there lurking and crouching in the darkness were the jackals
   and hyenas of superstition ready to violate his grave.

   These birds of prey -- these unclean beasts are the witnesses produced and
   relied upon by you.

   One by one the instruments of torture have been wrenched from the cruel
   clutch of the church, until within the armory of orthodoxy there remains
   but one weapon -- Slander.

   Against the witnesses that I have produced you can bring just two -- Mary
   Roscoe and Mary Hinsdale. The first is referred to in the memoir of
   Stephen Grellet. She had once been a servant in his house. Grellet tells
   what happened between this girl and Paine. According to this account Paine
   asked her if she had ever read any of his writings, and on being told that
   she had read very little of them, he inquired what she thought of them,
   adding that from such an one as she he expected a correct answer.

   Let us examine this falsehood. Why would Paine expect a correct answer
   about his writings from one who had read very little of them? Does not
   such a statement devour itself? This young lady further said that the "Age
   of Reason" was put in her hands and that the more she read in it the more
   dark and distressed she felt, and that she threw the book into the fire.
   Whereupon Mr. Paine remarked, "I wish all had done as you did, for if the
   devil ever had any agency in any work, he had it in my writing that book."

   The next is Mary Hinsdale. She was a servant in the family of Willet
   Hicks. She, like Mary Roscoe, was sent to carry some delicacy to Mr.
   Paine. To this young lady Paine, according to her account, said precisely
   the same that he did to Mary Roscoe, and she said the same thing to Mr.
   Paine.

   My own opinion is that Mary Roscoe and Mary Hinsdale are one and the same
   person, or the same story has been by mistake put in the mouth of both.

   It is not possible that the same conversation should have taken place
   between Paine and Mary Roscoe, and between him and Mary Hinsdale.

   Mary Hinsdale lived with Willet Hicks and he pronounced her story a pious
   fraud and fabrication. He said that Thomas Paine never said any such thing
   to Mary Hinsdale. (See Vale's Life of Paine.)

   Another thing about this witness. A woman by the name of Mary Lockwood, a
   Hicksite Quaker, died. Mary Hinsdale met her brother about that time and
   told him that his sister had recanted, and wanted her to say so at her
   funeral. This turned out to be false.

   It has been claimed that Mary Hinsdale made her statement to Charles
   Collins. Long after the alleged occurrence Gilbert Vale, one of the
   biographers of Paine, had a conversation with Collins concerning Mary
   Hinsdale. Vale asked him what he thought of her. He replied that some of
   the Friends believed that she used opiates, and that they did not give
   credit to her statements. He also said that he believed what the Friends
   said, but thought that when a young woman, she might have told the truth.

   In 1818 William Cobbett came to New York. He began collecting materials
   for a life of Thomas Paine. In this he became acquainted with Mary
   Hinsdale and Charles Collins. Mr. Cobbett gave a full account of what
   happened in a letter addressed to the Norwich Mercury in 1819. From this
   account it seems that Charles Collins told Cobbett that Paine had
   recanted. Cobbett called for the testimony, and told Mr. Collins that he
   must give time, place, and the circumstances. He finally brought a
   statement that he stated had been made by Mary Hinsdale. Armed with this
   document Cobbett, in October of that year, called upon the said Mary
   Hinsdale, at No. 10 Anthony street, New York, and showed her the
   statement. Upon being questioned by Mr. Cobbett she said, "That it was so
   long ago that she could not speak positively to any part of the matter --
   that she would not say that any part of the paper was true -- that she had
   never seen the paper -- and that she had never given Charles Collins
   authority to say anything about the matter in her name." And so in the
   month of October, in the year of grace 1818, in the mist and fog of
   forgetfulness disappeared forever one Mary Hinsdale -- the last and only
   witness against the intellectual honesty of Thomas Paine.

   Did Thomas Paine live the life of a drunken beast, and did he die a
   drunken, cowardly and beastly death?

   Upon you rests the burden of substantiating these infamous charges.

   You have, I suppose, produced the best evidence in your possession, and
   that evidence I will now proceed to examine. Your first witness is Grant
   Thorburn. He makes three charges against Thomas Paine. 1st. That his wife
   obtained a divorce from him in England for cruelty and neglect. 2d. That
   he was a defaulter and fled from England to America. 3d. That he was a
   drunkard.

   These three charges stand upon the same evidence -- the word of Grant
   Thorburn. If they are not all true Mr. Thorburn stands impeached.

   The charge that Mrs. Paine obtained a divorce on account of the cruelty
   and neglect of her husband is utterly false. There is no such record in
   the world, and never was. Paine and his wife separated by mutual consent.
   Each respected the other. They remained friends. This charge is without
   any foundation in fact. I challenge the Christian world to produce the
   record of this decree of divorce. According to Mr. Thorburn it was granted
   in England. In that country public records are kept of all such decrees.
   Have the kindness to produce this decree showing that it was given on
   account of cruelty or admit that Mr. Thorburn was mistaken.

   Thomas Paine was a just man. Although separated from his wife, he always
   spoke of her with tenderness and respect, and frequently sent her money
   without letting her know the source from whence it came. Was this the
   conduct of a drunken beast?

   The second charge, that Paine was a defaulter in England and fled to
   America, is equally false. He did not flee from England. He came to
   America, not as a fugitive, but as a free man. He came with a letter of
   introduction signed by another Infidel, Benjamin Franklin. He came as a
   soldier of Freedom -- an apostle of Liberty.

   In this second charge there is not one word of truth.

   He held a small office in England. If he was a defaulter the records of
   that country will show that fact.

   Mr. Thorburn, unless the record can be produced to substantiate him,
   stands convicted of at least two mistakes.

   Now, as to the third: He says that in 1802 Paine was an "old remnant of
   mortality, drunk, bloated and half asleep."

   Can any one believe this to be a true account of the personal appearance
   of Mr. Paine in, 1802? He had just returned from France. He had been
   welcomed home by Thomas Jefferson, who had said that he was entitled to
   the hospitality of every American.

   In 1802 Mr. Paine was honored with a public dinner in the city of New
   York. He was called upon and treated with kindness and respect by such men
   as DeWitt Clinton.

   In 1806 Mr. Paine wrote a letter to Andrew A. Dean upon the subject of
   religion. Read that letter and then say that the writer of it was an "old
   remnant of mortality, drunk, bloated and half asleep." Search the files of
   the New York Observer from the first issue to the last, and you will find
   nothing superior to this letter.

   In 1803 Mr. Paine wrote a letter of considerable length, and of great
   force, to his friend Samuel Adams. Such letters are not written by drunken
   beasts, nor by remnants of old mortality, nor by drunkards. It was about
   the same time that he wrote his "Remarks on Robert Hall's Sermons."

   These "Remarks" were not written by a drunken beast, but by a clear-headed
   and thoughtful man.

   In 1804 he published an essay on the invasion of England, and a treatise
   on gunboats, full of valuable maritime information: -- in 1805, a treatise
   on yellow fever, suggesting modes of prevention. In short, he was an
   industrious and thoughtful man. He sympathized with the poor and oppressed
   of all lands. He looked upon monarchy as a species of physical slavery. He
   had the goodness to attack that form of government. He regarded the
   religion of his day as a kind of mental slavery. He had the courage to
   give his reasons for his opinion. His reasons filled the churches with
   hatred. Instead of answering his arguments they attacked him. Men who were
   not fit to blacken his shoes, blackened his character.

   There is too much religious cant in the statement of Mr. Thorburn. He
   exhibited too much anxiety to tell what Grant Thorburn said to Thomas
   Paine. He names Thomas Jefferson as one of the disreputable men who
   welcomed Paine with open arms. The testimony of a man who regarded Thomas
   Jefferson as a disreputable person, as to the character of anybody, is
   utterly without value. In my judgment, the testimony of Mr. Thorburn
   should be thrown aside as wholly unworthy of belief.

   Your next witness is the Rev. J.D. Wickham, D.D., who tells what an elder
   in his church said. This elder said that Paine passed his last days on his
   farm at New Rochelle with a solitary female attendant. This is not true.
   He did not pass his last days at New Rochelle. Consequently this pious
   elder did not see him during his last days at that place. Upon this elder
   we prove an alibi. Mr. Paine passed his last days in the city of New York,
   in a house upon Columbia street. The story of the Rev. J.D. Wickham, D.D.,
   is simply false.

   The next competent false witness is the Rev. Charles Hawley, D.D., who
   proceeds to state that the story of the Rev. J.D. Wickham, D.D., is
   corroborated by older citizens of New Rochelle. The names of these ancient
   residents are withheld. According to these unknown witnesses, the account
   given by the deceased elder was entirely correct. But as the particulars
   of Mr. Paine's conduct "were too loathsome to be described in print," we
   are left entirely in the dark as to what he really did.

   While at New Rochelle Mr. Paine lived with Mr. Purdy -- with Mr. Dean --
   with Captain Pelton, and with Mr. Staple. It is worthy of note that all of
   these gentlemen give the lie direct to the statements of "older residents"
   and ancient citizens spoken of by the Rev. Charles Hawley, D.D., and leave
   him with his "loathsome particulars" existing only in his own mind.

   The next gentleman you bring upon the stand is W.H. Ladd, who quotes from
   the memoirs of Stephen Grellet. This gentleman also has the misfortune to
   be dead. According to his account, Mr. Paine made his recantation to a
   servant girl of his by the name of Mary Roscoe. To this girl, according to
   the account, Mr. Paine uttered the wish that all who read his book had
   burned it. I believe there is a mistake in the name of this girl. Her name
   was probably Mary Hinsdale, as it was once claimed that Paine made the
   same remark to her, but this point I shall notice hereafter. These are
   your witnesses, and the only ones you bring forward, to support your
   charge that Thomas Paine lived a drunken and beastly life and died a
   drunken, cowardly and beastly death. All these calumnies are found in a
   life of Paine by a Mr. Cheetham, the convicted libeler already referred
   to. Mr. Cheetham was an enemy of the man whose life he pretended to write.

   In order to show you the estimation in which Mr. Cheetham was held by Mr.
   Paine, I will give you a copy of a letter that throws light upon this
   point:

                                       October 28, 1807.                     

   "MR. CHEETHAM: Unless you make a public apology for the abuse and
   falsehood in your paper of Tuesday, October 27th, respecting me, I will
   prosecute you for lying."

                                           THOMAS PAINE.                     

   In another letter, speaking of this same man, Mr. Paine says: "If an
   unprincipled bully cannot be reformed, he can be punished." " Cheetham has
   been so long in the habit of giving false information, that truth is to
   him like a foreign language."

   Mr. Cheetham wrote the life of Paine to gratify his malice and to support
   religion. He was prosecuted for libel -- was convicted and fined.

   Yet the life of Paine written by this man is referred to by the Christian
   world as the highest authority.

   As to the personal habits of Mr. Paine, we have the testimony of William
   Carver, with whom he lived; of Mr. Jarvis, the artist, with whom he lived;
   of Mr. Staple, with whom he lived; of Mr. Purdy, who was a tenant of
   Paine's; of Mr. Burger, with whom he was intimate; of Thomas Nixon and
   Captain Daniel Pelton, both of whom knew him well; of Amasa Woodsworth,
   who was with him when he died; of John Fellows, who boarded at the same
   house; of James Wilburn, with whom he boarded; of B.F. Haskin, a lawyer,
   who was well acquainted with him and called upon him during his last
   illness; of Walter Morton, a friend; of Clio Rickman, who had known him
   for many years; of Willet and Elias Hicks, Quakers, who knew him
   intimately and well; of Judge Herttell H. Margary, Elihu Palmer, and many
   others. All these testified to the fact that Mr. Paine was a temperate
   man. In those days nearly everybody used spirituous liquors. Paine was not
   an exception; but he did not drink to excess. Mr. Lovett, who kept the
   City Hotel where Paine stopped, in a note to Caleb Bingham, declared that
   Paine drank less than any boarder he had.

   Against all this evidence you produce the story of Grant Thorburn -- the
   story of the Rev. J.D. Wickham that an elder in his church told him that
   Paine was a drunkard, corroborated by the Rev. Charles Hawley, and an
   extract from Lossing's history to the same effect. The evidence is
   overwhelmingly against you. Will you have the fairness to admit it? Your
   witnesses are merely the repeaters of the falsehoods of James Cheetham,
   the convicted libeler.

   After all, drinking is not as bad as lying. An honest drunkard is better
   than a calumniator of the dead. "A remnant of old mortality, drunk,
   bloated and half asleep" is better than a perfectly sober defender of
   human slavery.

   To become drunk is a virtue compared with stealing a babe from the breast
   of its mother.

   Drunkenness is one of the beatitudes, compared with editing a religious
   paper devoted to the defence of slavery upon the ground that it is a
   divine institution.

   Do you really think that Paine was a drunken beast when he wrote "Common
   Sense" -- a pamphlet that aroused three millions of people, as people were
   never aroused by a pamphlet before? Was he a drunken beast when he wrote
   the "Crisis"? Was it to a drunken beast that the following letter was
   addressed:

                         ROCKY HILL, September 10. 1783.                     

   "I have learned since I have been at this place, that you are at
   Bordentown. -- Whether for the sake of retirement or economy I know not.
   Be it for either or both, or whatever it may, if you will come to this
   place and partake with me I shall be exceedingly happy to see you at it.
   Your presence may remind Congress of your past services to this country;
   and if it is in my power to impress them, command my best exertions with
   freedom, as they will be rendered cheerfully by one who entertains a
   lively sense of the importance of your works, and who with much pleasure
   subscribes himself,"

                              Your Sincere Friend,

                                      GEORGE WASHINGTON.                     

   Did any of your ancestors ever receive a letter like that?

   Do you think that Paine was a drunken beast when the following letter was
   received by him?

   "You express a wish in your letter to return to America in a national
   ship; Mr. Dawson, who brings over the treaty, and who will present you
   with this letter, is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland to
   receive and accommodate you back, if you can be ready to depart at such a
   short warning. You will in general find us returned to sentiments worthy
   of former times; in these it will be your glory to have steadily labored
   and with as much effect as any man living. That you may live long to
   continue your useful labors, and reap the reward in the thankfulness of
   nations, is my sincere prayer. Accept the assurances of my high esteem and
   affectionate attachment."

                                       THOMAS JEFFERSON.                     

   Did any of your ancestors ever receive a letter like that?

   "It has been very generally propagated through the continent that I wrote
   the pamphlet 'Common Sense.' I could not have written anything in so manly
   and striking a style. -- JOHN ADAMS.

   "A few more such flaming arguments as were exhibited at Falmouth and
   Norfolk, added to the sound doctrine and unanswerable reasoning contained
   in the pamphlet 'Common Sense,' will not leave numbers at a loss to decide
   on the propriety of a separation." -- GEORGE WASHINGTON.

   "It is not necessary for me to tell you 'how much all your countrymen -- I
   speak of the great mass of the people -- are interested in your welfare.
   They have not forgotten the history of their own Revolution and the
   difficult scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its several
   stages without reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the merits of
   those who served them in that great and arduous conflict. The crime of
   ingratitude has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain, our
   national character. You are considered by them as not only having rendered
   important services in our own Revolution, but as being on a more extensive
   scale the friend of human rights, and a distinguished and able defender of
   public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas Paine the Americans are not, nor
   can they be indifferent." -- JAMES MONROE.

   Did any of your ancestors ever receive a letter like that?

   "No writer has exceeded Paine in ease and familiarity of style, in
   perspicuity of expression, happiness of elucidation, and in simple and
   unassuming language." -- THOMAS JEFFERSON.

   Was ever a letter like that written about an editor of the New York
   Observer?

   Was it in consideration of the services of a drunken beast that the
   Legislature of Pennsylvania presented Thomas Paine with five hundred
   pounds sterling?

   Did the State of New York feel indebted to a drunken beast, and confer
   upon Thomas Paine an estate of several hundred acres?

   "I believe in the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties
   consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our
   fellow-creatures happy."

   "My own mind is my own church."

   "It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to
   himself."

   "Any system of religion that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true
   system."

   "The Word of God is the creation which we behold."

   "The age of ignorance commenced with the Christian system."

   "It is with a pious fraud as with a bad action -- it begets a calamitous
   necessity of going on."

   "To read the Bible without horror, we must undo everything that is tender,
   sympathizing and benevolent in the heart of man."

   "The man does not exist who can say I have persecuted him, or that I have
   in any case returned evil for evil."

   "Of all tyrannies that afflict mankind, tyranny in religion is the worst."

   "My own opinion is, that those whose lives have been spent in doing good
   and endeavoring to make their fellow-mortals happy, will be happy
   hereafter."

   "The belief in a cruel god makes a cruel man."

   "The intellectual part of religion is a private affair between every man
   and his Maker, and in which no third party has any right to interfere. The
   practical part consists in our doing good to each other."

   "No man ought to make a living by religion. One person cannot act religion
   for another -- every person must perform it for himself."

   "One good schoolmaster is of more use than a hundred priests."

   "Let us propagate morality unfettered by superstition."

   "God is the power, or first cause, Nature is the law, and matter is the
   subject acted upon."

   "I believe in one God and no more, and I hope for happiness beyond this
   life."

   "The key of heaven is not in the keeping of any sect nor ought the road to
   it to be obstructed by any."

   "My religion, and the whole of it, is the fear and love of the Deity and
   universal philanthropy."

   "I have yet, I believe, some years in store, for I have a good state of
   health and a happy mind. I take care of both, by nourishing the first with
   temperance and the latter with abundance."

   "He lives immured within the Bastille of a word."

   How perfectly that sentence describes you: The Bastille in which you are
   immured is the word "Calvinism."

   "Man has no property in man."

   What a splendid motto that would have made for the New York Observer in
   the olden time!

   "The world is my country; to do good, my religion."

   I ask you again whether these splendid utterances came from the lips of a
   drunken beast?

   Did Thomas Paine die in destitution and want?

   The charge has been made, over and over again, that Thomas Paine died in
   want and destitution -- that he was an abandoned pauper -- an outcast
   without friends and without money. This charge is just as false as the
   rest.

   Upon his return to this country in 1802, he was worth $30.000, according
   to his own statement made at that time in the following letter addressed
   to Clio Rickman:

   "MY DEAR FRIEND: Mr. Monroe, who is appointed minister extraordinary to
   France, takes charge of this, to be delivered to Mr. Este, banker in
   Paris, to be forwarded to you.

   "I arrived at Baltimore the 30th of October, and you can have no idea of
   the agitation which my arrival occasioned. From New Hampshire to Georgia
   (an extent of 1,500 miles) every newspaper was filled with applause or
   abuse.

   "My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and is
   now worth six thousand pounds sterling; which put in the funds will bring
   me -L-400 sterling a year.

   "Remember me in affection and friendship to your wife and family, and in
   the circle of your friends."

                                           THOMAS PAINE.                     

   A man in those days worth thirty thousand dollars was not a pauper. That
   amount would bring an income of at least two thousand dollars per annum.
   Two thousand dollars then would be fully equal to five thousand dollars
   now.

   On the 12th of July, 1809, the year in which he died, Mr. Paine made his
   will. From this instrument we learn that he was the owner of a valuable
   farm within twenty miles of New York. He also was the owner of thirty
   shares in the New York Phoenix Insurance Company, worth upwards of fifteen
   hundred dollars. Besides this, some personal property and ready money. By
   his will he gave to Walter Morton, and Thomas Addis Emmett, brother of
   Robert Emmett, two hundred dollars each, and one hundred to the widow of
   Elihu Palmer.

   Is it possible that this will was made by a pauper -- by a destitute
   outcast -- by a man who suffered for the ordinary necessaries of life?

   But suppose, for the sake of the argument, that he was poor and that he
   died a beggar, does that tend to show that the Bible is an inspired book
   and that Calvin did not burn Servetus? Do you really regard poverty as a
   crime? If Paine had died a millionaire, would you have accepted his
   religious opinions? If Paine had drank nothing but cold water would you
   have repudiated the five cardinal points of Calvinism? Does an argument
   depend for its force upon the pecuniary condition of the person making it?
   As a matter of fact, most reformers -- most men and women of genius, have
   been acquainted with poverty. Beneath a covering of rags have been found
   some of the tenderest and bravest hearts.

   Owing to the attitude of the churches for the last fifteen hundred years,
   truth-telling has not been a very lucrative business. As a rule, hypocrisy
   has worn the robes, and honesty the rags. That day is passing away. You
   cannot now answer the arguments of a man by pointing at holes in his coat.
   Thomas Paine attacked the church when it was powerful -- when it had what
   was called honors to bestow -- when it was the keeper of the public
   conscience -- when it was strong and cruel. The church waited till he was
   dead then attacked his reputation and his clothes.

   Once upon a time a donkey kicked a lion. The lion was dead.

                                  CONCLUSION.

   From the persistence with which the orthodox have charged for the last
   sixty-eight years that Thomas Paine recanted, and that when dying he was
   filled with remorse and fear; from the malignity of the attacks upon his
   personal character, I had concluded that there must be some evidence of
   some kind to support these charges. Even with my ideas of the average
   honor of believers in superstition -- the disciples of fear -- I did not
   quite believe that all these infamies rested solely upon poorly attested
   lies. I had charity enough to suppose that something had been said or done
   by Thomas Paine capable of being tortured into a foundation for these
   calumnies. And I was foolish enough to think that even you would be
   willing to fairly examine the pretended evidence said to sustain these
   charges, and give your honest conclusion to the world. I supposed that
   you, being acquainted with the history of your country: felt under a
   certain obligation to Thomas Paine for the splendid services rendered by
   him in the darkest days of the Revolution. It was only reasonable to
   suppose that you were aware that in the midnight of Valley Forge the
   "Crisis," by Thomas Paine, was the first star that glittered in the wide
   horizon of despair. I took it for granted that you knew of the bold stand
   taken and the brave words spoken by Thomas Paine, in the French
   Convention, against the death of the king. I thought it probable that you,
   being an editor, had read the "Rights of Man;" that you knew that Thomas
   Paine was a champion of human liberty; that he was one of the founders and
   fathers of this Republic; that he was one of the foremost men of his age;
   that he had never written a word in favor of injustice; that he was a
   despiser of slavery; that he abhorred tyranny in all its forms; that he
   was in the widest and highest sense a friend of his race; that his head
   was as clear as his heart was good, and that he had the courage to speak
   his honest thought. Under these circumstances I had hoped that you would
   for the moment forget your religious prejudices and submit to the
   enlightened judgment of the world the evidence you had, or could obtain,
   affecting in any way the character of so great and so generous a man. This
   you have refused to do. ln my judgment, you have mistaken the temper of
   even your own readers. A large majority of the religious people of this
   country have, to a considerable extent, outgrown the prejudices of their
   fathers. They are willing to know the truth and the whole truth, about the
   life and death of Thomas Paine. They will not thank you for having
   presented them the moss-covered, the maimed and distorted traditions of
   ignorance, prejudice, and credulity. By this course you will convince them
   not of the wickedness of Paine, but of your own unfairness.

   What crime had Thomas Paine committed that he should have feared to die?
   The only answer you can give is, that he denied the inspiration of the
   Scriptures. If this is a crime, the civilized world is filled with
   criminals. The pioneers of human thought -- the intellectual leaders of
   the world -- the foremost men in every science -- the kings of literature
   and art -- those who stand in the front rank of investigation -- men who
   are civilizing, elevating, instructing, and refining mankind, are to-day
   unbelievers in the dogma of inspiration. Upon this question, the intellect
   of Christendom agrees with the conclusions reached by the genius of Thomas
   Paine. Centuries ago a noise was made for the purpose of frightening
   mankind. Orthodoxy is the echo of that noise.

   The man who now regards the Old Testament as in any sense a sacred or
   inspired book is, in my judgment, an intellectual and moral deformity.
   There is in it so much that is cruel, ignorant, and ferocious that it is
   to me a matter of amazement that it was ever thought to be the work of a
   most merciful deity.

   Upon the question of inspiration Thomas Paine gave his honest opinion. Can
   it be that to give an honest opinion causes one to die in terror and
   despair? Have you in your writings been actuated by the fear of such a
   consequence? Why should it be taken for granted that Thomas Paine, who
   devoted his life to the sacred cause of freedom, should have been hissed
   at in the hour of death by the snakes of conscience, while editors of
   Presbyterian papers who defended slavery as a divine institution, and
   cheerfully justified the stealing of babes from the breasts of mothers,
   are supposed to have passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of
   angels? Why should you think that the heroic author of the "Rights of Man"
   should shudderingly dread to leave this "bank and shoal of time," while
   Calvin, dripping with the blood of Servetus, was anxious to be judged of
   God? Is it possible that the persecutors -- the instigators of the
   massacre of St. Bartholomew -- the inventors and users of thumb-screws,
   and iron boots, and racks -- the burners and tearers of human flesh -- the
   stealers, whippers and enslavers of men -- the buyers and beaters of babes
   and mothers -- the founders of inquisitions -- the makers of chains, the
   builders of dungeons, the slanderers of the living and the calumniators of
   the dead, all died in the odor of sanctity, with white, forgiven hands
   folded upon the breasts of peace, while the destroyers of prejudice -- the
   apostles of humanity -- the soldiers of liberty -- the breakers of fetters
   -- the creators of light -- died surrounded with the fierce fiends of
   fear?

   In your attempt to destroy the character of Thomas Paine you have failed,
   and have succeeded only in leaving a stain upon your own. You have written
   words as cruel, bitter and heartless as the creed of Calvin. Hereafter you
   will stand in the pillory of history as a defamer -- a calumniator of the
   dead. You will be known as the man who said that Thomas Paine, the "Author
   Hero," lived a drunken, cowardly and beastly life, and died a drunken and
   beastly death. These infamous words will be branded upon the forehead of
   your reputation. They will be remembered against you when all else you may
   have uttered shall have passed from the memory of men.
