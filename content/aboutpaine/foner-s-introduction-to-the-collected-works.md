   THOMAS PAINE-WORLD CITIZEN AND DEMOCRAT

   (Footnotes are located at the end of the essay)

   His name is Paine, a gentleman about two years from England -a man who,
   General Lee says, has genius in his eyes." So John Adams described the
   author of the widely-discussed pamphlet, Common Sense, published
   anonymously early in 1776.

   Thomas Paine, the man with "genius in his eyes," was born January 29,
   1737, at Thetford in Norfolk, England, of a Quaker father and an Anglican
   mother. His father was a poor corset-maker who could barely afford to send
   his son to a free school where he was taught just enough to master
   reading, writing and arithmetic. At thirteen young Paine began to work
   with his father as a staymaker; three years laterhe ran away from home,
   went to sea and served as a sailor on a privateer in the Seven Years' War.
   He returned to London after two eventful voyages which included a terrific
   sea-battle and lived by finding such occupations as he could. He worked
   for a while as a staymaker; then became a government worker, holding a
   minor job in the collection of the excise, and, after he was dismissed
   from this post, was employed in 1767 in a school at Kensington. A year
   later he was working for the government again as an excise officer at
   Lewes, Sussex. He had married in 1759, but the marriage was cut short by
   the death of his wife a year later. His second marriage in 1771 was cut
   short by a legal separation.

   During these years Paine took steps to supplement the meagre education he
   had received at the Thetford Grammar School. From his pitiful earnings as
   a staymaker and exciseman, he purchased books and scientific apparatus
   such as a pair of globes. When he lived in London during the period
   1757-59, he attended in his spare time the lectures on Newtonian astronomy
   given by Benjamin Martin, James Ferguson, and Dr. Bevis. He continued his
   process of self-education throughout his life, convinced that "every
   person of learning is finally his own teacher." "I seldom passed five
   minutes of my life however circumstanced," he once observed, "in which I
   did not acquire some knowledge." No one who traces his lifelong pursuit of
   education and notes the authors he cites in his writings, will lightly
   accept the conventional sneer that Paine displayed an "immense ignorance"
   throughout his career.    

    Both his Quaker background and his study of Newtonian science influenced
   his thinking along progressive lines, though neither probably had the
   effect that some writers have stressed.1 Unquestionably Paine was
   influenced to some degree by his acquaintance with the religion of his
   father, for the Quakers were pioneers in many humanitarian enterprises,
   including anti-slavery, women's rights and prison reform. Undoubtedly,
   too, by revealing to Paine a harmonious and universal order guided by
   divinely-created law, Newtonian science greatly influenced his political
   and religious thinking. But life itself was an extremely important
   teacher. During the first thirty-seven years of his life he saw enough
   misery in England, enough of the contrast between the affluence of the
   upper classes and the poverty and suffering of the masses to influence his
   thinking for the remainder of his days.

   In the England of his youth and manhood Paine saw the vicious effects of
   the enclosure system which threw thousands of small, independent farmers
   into the cities and transformed them from independent yeomanry to landless
   factory workers and agricultural laborers. All about him he saw thousands
   struggling in the midst of misery and degradation to eke out an existence,
   and daily passed "ragged and hungry children, and persons of seventy and
   eighty years of age, begging in the streets." He knew too from his own
   intolerably inadequate salary how difficult it was to secure even a
   subsistence living standard at a time when commodity prices were soaring
   and wages remained practically stationary. He also noticed the vicious
   operations of the poor laws which almost reduced workers to serfs,
   witnessed the brutality of the savage criminal code and observed how it
   was directed chiefly against the lower classes. Nor could he help noticing
   the burdens imposed upon the poor by the Anglican Church with its tithes
   and privileges, the role that family influence played in English politics,
   the  inequalities of the rotten-borough system (in Thetford alone
   thirty-one persons elected two members of the House of Commons), and the
   corruption that characterized government administration. 

   These experiences left their mark upon Paine. Himself a working man, he
   was to use his pen, time and again, in an effort to improve the status of
   the laboring classes. Indeed, his earliest known prose composition and his
   first important pamphlet, The Case of the Officers of Excise, was written
   to achieve this purpose. In 1772 he was chosen by excisemen to address
   Parliament in their behalf requesting higher wages. After the pamphlet was
   written, Paine spent the winter of 1772-73 trying to influence members of
   Parliament to grant the underpaid excisemen an increase of wages. Regarded
   as a trouble-maker by the authorities for attempting to organize his
   fellow excisemen, he was dismissed from the service.

   Paine lost his government job on April 8, 1774. A week later he was forced
   to sell his shop and possessions to escape imprisonment for debt. Having
   tasted the bitter dregs of British tyranny long enough, Paine decided to
   begin life all over again in the New World. He left England in October,
   1774, and on November 30 landed in America bearing a letter of
   introduction from Benjamin Franklin whom he had approached in London.
   Franklin's letter to his son-in-law, Richard Bache, recommended Paine as
   "an ingenious worthy young man," who might make good in Philadelphia as "a
   clerk, or assistant tutor in a school, or assistant surveyor."

    Arriving in America armed with Franklin's letter, Paine speedily obtained
   employment with Robert Aitken, a Philadelphia printer. Soon he became the
   editor of the Pennsylvania Magazine which Aitken had started with very
   little success to publish. On March 4, 1775, the man who had left England
   branded as a ne'er-do-well wrote a joyful letter to his benefactor. "Your
   countenancing me," he informed Franklin, "has obtained for me many friends
   and much reputation . . . I have been applied to by several gentlemen to
   instruct their sons . . . and a printer and bookseller here, a man of
   reputation and property, Robert Aitken, . . . has applied to me for
   assistance. He had not above six hundred subscribers when I first assisted
   him. We now have upwards of fifteen hundred and daily increasing . . ."

   For eighteen months, beginning with the second number in February, 1775,
   Paine served as editor of the Pennsylvania Magazine, and during this time
   he published enough important articles in this and other journals to be
   remembered as a significant figure in American history, even if he had
   never written anything else. A few weeks after his arrival in America,
   Paine wrote an article entitled, "African Slavery in America," which ranks
   as the best of the early attacks upon slavery in this country. Paine put
   the enslavement of the Negro people on a level with "murder, robbery,
   lewdness, and barbarity," and called upon Americans immediately to
   "discontinue and renounce it, with grief and abhorrence." When the article
   was printed on March 8, 1775, Paine gained a wide reputation for his
   liberal views, and won for himself the friendship of Dr. Benjamin Rush and
   other important figures in literary and philosophical circles. 

   The time was ripe for the activity of a lover of liberty when Paine
   arrived in America. The struggle between England and her colonies had been
   raging since 1763, and the very atmosphere breathed revolutionary slogans.
   In his early articles for the Pennsylvania Magazine, however, Paine did
   not deal with any of the pressing political problems confronting the
   colonists in their quarrel with the mother country. In part this was due
   to the insistence of his timid publisher, for Aitken was determined not to
   antagonize any wealthy subscribers who viewed the revolutionary movement
   with alarm. But it was also due to Paine's belief that it was still
   possible to reconcile the differences between England and her colonies.
   Soon a rush of events showed him the futility of this outlook. On April
   19, 1775, the battle of Lexington and Concord was fought, an event which
   convinced Paine that "all plans, proposals, etc.," to settle the conflict
   by compromise were "like the almanacks of the last year; which though
   proper then, are superceded and useless now." And on June 15 Washington
   was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental army. A day later the
   battle of Bunker Hill occurred.

   Moved by these and other events of a similar nature, Paine started to use
   his pen to aid the revolutionary movement. On September 16, 1775, he
   published a poem in the Pennsylvania Evening Post entitled, "The Liberty
   Tree," the last stanza of which attacked the king as well as Parliament
   and issued a call

                 From the East to the West blow the trumpet to arms,
                   Thro' the land let the sound of it flee:
                 Let the far and the near all unite with a cheer,
                   In defense of our Liberty Tree. 

   But Paine was already forming the outlines of a much more important call
   to arms, for he discovered that poetry was not enough to convince men in
   high circles that it was time to open a "new system" in America. He was
   determined to change "the sentiments of the people from dependence to
   Independence and from the monarchial to the republican form of government
   . . ." This was no simple task to accomplish. While the mass of the
   artisans, mechanics and day-laborers in the urban centres and many small
   farmers in the rural districts were prepared for such a step, many of the
   members of the colonial aristocracy were by no means ready to follow Paine
   down the road leading to Independence and Republicanism. Independence,
   they feared, would bring to an end the rule of the upper classes in
   America, and Republicanism signified nothing less than anarchy and
   mob-rule. Better to tolerate the tyranny of the British government, they
   reasoned, than to chance the dangers of a democratic upheaval in America.

   Paine moved quickly to meet and overcome these fears and hesitations. In a
   short article, "A Serious Thought," published in the Pennsylvania Journal
   on October 18, 1775, he sharply projected the idea of independence.
   Discussing the barbaric conduct of the British in India and criticizing
   England for her treatment of the Indians in America band for having
   "employed herself in the most horrid of all traffics,' that bof human
   flesh . . . [and] ravaged the hapless shore of Africa, robbing it of its
   unoffending inhabitants to cultivate her stolen dominions in the West," he
   went on to say: "When I reflect on these, I hesitate not for a moment to
   believe that the Almighty will finally separate America from Britain. Call
   it Independence or what you will, if it is the cause of God and humanity
   it will go on." 

   In December, 1775, Paine showed the manuscript of a pamphlet he had
   finished to David Rittenhouse and Dr. Benjamin Rush, and the latter,
   according to his own account, suggested to him the title for the work and
   found a publisher, Robert Bell, with sufficient courage to print it. The
   work came off the press on January 10, 1776. It was entitled Common Sense.

   Paine was not the first person to advocate independence in America; John
   Adams had done so, for example, even before Common Sense was published.
   Nevertheless, the influence and power of this fifty-page pamphlet can
   hardly be exaggerated. "With the publication of Common Sense in January
   1776," writes John C. Miller in his Origins of the American Revolution (p.
   468), "Tom Paine broke the ice that was slowly congealing the
   revolutionary movement." And Evarts B. Greene, the distinguished historian
   of the Revolutionary era, observes in his recently-published study, The
   Revolutionary Generation (p. 209), "Thomas Paine's Common Sense, more than
   any other single piece of writing, set Americans to thinking of the
   possibility and desirability of an independent place among the nations."

    Written in simple, plain, and direct language easily read and understood
   by all, Common Sense became overnight a best-seller; shortly after its
   publication almost a half a million copies were sold, and many of its most
   trenchant paragraphs were reprinted in newspapers all over the country.
   Soon the common people were quoting sections from the booklet which
   hammered home the need for separation, held up hereditary monarchy to
   contempt, denounced the British ruling classes for exploiting the lower
   classes in America and in England, and urged the colonies to declare
   themselves free and independent states so that they might establish in
   America a haven of refuge for the oppressed peoples of Europe. More
   cautious and conservative Americans quoted other sections, particularly
   the arguments Paine advanced in support of a declaration of independence:
   the prospect that by independence America could remain aloof from the
   European conflicts into which she was constantly being drawn by her
   connection with the British Empire; the possibilities of enormous markets
   in all of Europe for merchants and farmers once the restrictions imposed
   by the British on American economic life were broken, and the great
   certainty of obtaining foreign aid in the war for independence.2 Shortly
   after reading the booklet many upper class Americans who had hesitated to
   support independence for fear of meeting the power of the British
   singlehanded and did not yet clearly see the advantages of separation,
   declared with Washington that they were ready "to shake off all
   connections with a state so unjust and unnatural."

   Terrified by the influence of Paine's booklet, the Tories sought
   frantically to nullify its effects upon the people. Several answers to
   Paine's "artful, insidious, and pernicious" work were published, the most
   important attack consisting of a series of letters signed "Cato," which
   were first printed in the Philadelphia Gazette beginning in April, 1776.
   Paine immediately wrote four letters in reply, known as The Forester's
   Letters, in which he expanded and amplified many of the arguments he had
   first advanced in favor of independence in Common Sense. Widely reprinted
   in contemporary newspapers, these articles strengthened the popular demand
   for immediate independence. This demand in turn influenced the appointment
   on June 28 by the Continental Congress of a committee of five to draft a
   declaration of independence.

    Although primarily absorbed during these exciting months with the battle
   against tyranny abroad, Paine did not entirely ignore the struggle for
   democracy in America. Together with Benjamin Franklin and other
   progressive leaders in Pennsylvania, he assisted in mobilizing the popular
   forces for the enactment of a liberal state constitution. Supported by the
   Philadelphia artisans and the western farmers, these men gradually swept
   away all vestiges of aristocratic rule in the state. Drawn up by Paine and
   Franklin, the Pennsylvania constitution, adopted late in 1776, provided
   for universal suffrage, democratic representation, complete religious
   freedom, and a unicameral legislature, elected annually. It was by far the
   most advanced state constitution adopted during the American Revolution,
   and Paine took pride in his part in shaping the document, although he
   later questioned the wisdom of a unicameral legislature.3#3

    But Paine was doing more than writing Constitutions. In August, 1776, he
   joined the Pennsylvania Associators as voluntary secretary to General
   Roberdeau and, on September 19 was appointed aide-de-camp to General
   Greene who was at Fort Lee in New Jersey. By this time Washington's army,
   badly defeated in the battle of Long Island, was retreating toward New
   Jersey and, in November and December streamed across the state in
   disorderly fashion toward Philadelphia. It was a dark hour for the
   American cause. Morale in the army and on the home front was at its lowest
   ebb; a feeling prevailed that the enemy was invincible and that the war
   might as well end now. Naturally, the Tory speakers and newspapers
   emphasized that there was no hope for America other than in capitulation,
   and the flight of Congress from Philadelphia to Baltimore made these
   arguments seem plausible.

   Seated by a campfire near Newark, New Jersey, Paine started work on an
   appeal to the people in this hour of crisis. When he was finished, he
   rushed to Philadelphia and published in the Pennsylvania Journal of
   December 19, 1776, his Crisis I, and almost immediately it was issued in
   three pamphlet editions. His opening words in these days of adversity,
   "These are the times that try men's souls," rang out like a bugle and
   heartened the little band of patriots left with Washington. The soldiers
   who heard the words of Paine's great document-Washington ordered it read
   to his men-were inspired to face the floes, a blizzard and the swift
   current of the Delaware River on Christmas Eve and achieve the victory at
   Trenton which gave the Americans new courage. 

   Between 1776 and 1783 Paine published thirteen numbered essays and three
   extra numbers of The Crisis papers, each one signed "Common Sense." All
   were perfectly timed and perfectly adapted to the needs of the time. Did
   Lord Howe issue a proclamation urging Americans to negotiate a peace?
   Paine immediately answered him, exposed his proposal and attacked his Tory
   sympathizers in America. Did the Conway Cabal seek to oust Washington?
   Paine rushed to press to counteract this conspiracy. Did England send over
   a Commission for the purpose of winning the Americans away from the
   French? Paine issued a Crisis pamphlet which thoroughly ridiculed the
   negotiated peace ove tures and was influential in compelling the
   Commission to return to

   England empty-handed. Was there a danger that the war would be lost
   because of financial difficulties? Paine published his Crisis
   Extraordinary to prove that it would cost more to submit than to support
   the war financially. "Can it then be a question," he concluded after
   estimating the costs of defending the country and governing it after the
   war as two and three-quarters millions sterling, "whether it is better to
   raise two millions to defend the country, and govern it ourselves, and
   only three quarters of a million afterwards, or pay six millions to have
   it conquered and let the enemy govern it?" Finally, did it appear that the
   American victory would be rendered valueless by the absence of a strong
   union? Paine reminded the people that they could not help but "be strongly
   impressed with the advantage, as well as the necessity of strengthening
   that happy union which has been our salvation."

    Reprinted in most of the northern papers and in some of those in the
   South, the Crisis enormously aided the American cause and contributed to
   no small extent to ultimate victory. George Washington, Robert Morris, and
   Robert R. Livingston wrote early in 1782 that Paine had been "of
   considerable utility to the common cause by several of his Publications,"
   and secured from Congress a salary of $800 a year to enable him to
   continue to use his "abilities" in "informing the People and rousing them
   into action."

   In addition to "informing the people and rousing them into action," Paine
   held various posts in the national and state governments during the war.
   In 1777 Congress appointed him secretary to the Committee on Foreign
   Affairs, in which capacity he did much to obtain supplies, a large loan
   and military assistance from France. The fact that his services were
   appreciated moved him deeply. In a letter recently discovered, he wrote
   Franklin in Paris, on October 24, 177(8: "I have the pleasure of being
   respected and I feel a little of that satisfactory kind of pride that
   tells me I have some right to it." 4

    A month after this letter was written Paine became involved in a
   controversy with Silas Deane that abruptly brought his pleasure to an end,
   caused a torrent of abuse and defamation to be heaped on his head, and
   ultimately cost him his job as secretary to the Committee on Foreign
   Affairs.

   The crux of the debate between Paine and Silas Deane centered on the
   question whether the supplies furnished the United States by France before
   the Franco-American alliance of 1778, through Caron de Beaumarchais,
   adventurer and playwright, were a gift from the king of France or
   comprised a loan to the United States. Deane, attempting to profit
   personally from French aid to the United States and, as it was established
   later, had conspired with the British (for a considerable sum) against the
   American Revolution, maintained that the transactions were of a purely
   commercial nature and demanded payment of a five percent commission on
   purchases made for the American government. Paine supporting the position
   of Arthur Lee, also American Commissioner to France, charged that Deane
   was simply conspiring to defraud Congress of money. On December 14, 1778,
   in a letter To Silas Deane, Esq're, in the Pennsylvania Packet, Paine
   launched his public attack upon Deane. Answers from Deane's supporters
   followed, and Paine was compelled to continue the controversy. As he did
   so, however, he was also forced, to prove his contentions, to quote from
   secret documents to which he had access as secretary of the Committee on
   Foreign Affairs. Soon afterwards he had to resign his post owing to the
   opposition of those in Congress, who feared that his revelations
   jeopardized the alliance with France, as well as of those who considered
   Paine entirely too radical and believed he should never have been
   appointed in the first place. Gouverneur Morris, archconservative, told
   Congress that it was unseemly that the office of Secretary of Foreign
   Affairs should be held by "a mere adventurer from England, without
   fortune, without family or connexions, ignorant even of grammar."

    

   Paine's resignation did not end the controversy over Silas Deane. For many
   months articles on the subject appeared daily in the Philadelphia press.
   Most of them were printed over pseudonyms, but it is known that Paine,
   Arthur Lee, Richard Henry Lee, and Timothy Matlock penned those denouncing
   Deane, while Deane, Robert Morris, Matthew Clarkson, William Duer, and
   Gouverneur Morris spoke for the opposition. As the war of words continued
   other issues emerged, though in many ways they were related to the general
   question at issue. Paine had entered the controversy over Deane not merely
   because he wished to save Congress money, but also because he felt that
   the type of profiteering disclosed by Deane's conduct was too general in
   the country and endangered the revolutionary cause. He developed this
   theme in articles to the press after his resignation, pointing
   particularly to Robert Morris whose firm held important public contracts
   while he was conducting congressional business, and who was associated
   with Silas Deane in personal as well as governmental transactions.5 Paine
   publicly attacked Morris for his business associations with Deane,
   suggested that the State legislatures investigate such activities by all
   former and present delegates to Congress, and expressed the hope that the
   Pennsylvania legislature would take the lead.

   It is clear, therefore, that what started out as a debate over the role of
   an American Commissioner to France had become a struggle between radicals
   and conservatives in Pennsylvania. Here the wealthy merchants and
   professional aristocrats had been organizing since early in 1777 to
   overthrow the democratic State Constitution which committed the cardinal
   sin of allowing the common people according to their number a voice in
   their government. But the friends of the Constitution-mechanics and small
   farmers-also were organized to defend their charter of liberty. Paine,
   spokesman for the city artisans and mechanics, took his stand with the
   friends of the constitution he had helped to write. In articles to the
   press he defended the document and attacked those who sought to deprive
   the people of their democratic rights.6

    

   Paine also spoke for the people, especially the artisans, in his articles
   denouncing monopolizing practices which caused the cost of living to soar
   and were responsible for reducing the morale of workers who found it
   difficult to secure wage-increases. He was present at a mass meeting held
   on the 27th of May in the State House yard where a series of resolutions
   were adopted denouncing combinations "for raising the prices of goods and
   provisions." He also served on a Committee of Inspection before which
   leading merchants suspected of unscrupulous business methods were forced
   to appear.

   In the State elections which took place on October 12, 1779, the
   Constitutionalists won a resounding victory and, as a reward for his part
   in arousing popular support for the Constitution, the new Assembly elected
   Paine its Clerk. Actually, his position was more important than the name
   implies, for he was the close friend and advisor of Assembly leaders and
   influenced important legislation.

    

   In his new position Paine soon had an opportunity to see one of his dreams
   realized. Late in 1775, in his short article entitled "A Serious Thought,"
   he had looked forward to the day when God "shall have blest us, and made
   us a people dependent only upon Him, then may our gratitude be shown by an
   act of continental legislation, which shall put a stop to the importation
   of Negroes for sale, soften the hard fate of those already here, and in
   time procure their freedom." Five years later, as Clerk of the
   Pennsylvania Assembly, Paine wrote the "Pre-amble to the Act Passed by the
   Pennsylvania Assembly March 1, 1780," which provided for the gradual
   emancipation of Negro slaves in the state. It was the first legislative
   measure passed in America for the emancipation of slaves.

   While serving as Clerk, Paine was called upon to read to the Assembly
   Washington's appeal, dated May 28, 1780, for assistance to pay, feed and
   clothe his troops. "I assure you," Washington wrote in this letter, "every
   idea you can form of our distresses will fall short of the reality. There
   is such a combination of circumstances to exhaust the patience of the
   soldiery that it begins at length to be worn out, and we see in every line
   of the army the most serious features of mutiny and sedition." Paine did
   not forget this appeal after he finished reading. Leaving the assembly
   hall he drew out one thousand dollars due him on salary, sent five hundred
   dollars to Blair McClenaghan, a prominent merchant, and included a plea
   for the men of wealth to rally to aid the cause. "I feel the utmost
   concern," Paine wrote, "that the fairest cause that men ever engaged in,
   and with the fairest prospect of success should now be sunk so low, and
   that not from any new ability in the enemy but from a wilful neglect and
   decay of every species of public spirit in ourselves." He went on to point
   out that much financial assistance could not be expected from the artisans
   and small farmers, since it was "now hard time with many poor people." It
   remained, therefore, for the wealthy to fill the gap, which they should
   rush to do for "as it is the rich that will suffer most by the ravages of
   an Enemy it is not only duty but true policy to do something spirited." He
   hoped his five hundred dollars- "and if that is not sufficient I will add
   500 more"-would inaugurate a movement to rescue the cause in this dark
   hour. He was willing to bury all past political differences and cooperate
   with any patriotic society "no matter who may complete it." 7 Acting upon
   Paine's suggestion, several wealthy merchants and bankers in Philadelphia,
   with Robert Morris at their head, started the Bank of Pennsylvania to
   supply the army with provisions.

    

   Undoubtedly Paine's action in this crisis marked a change in his attitude
   toward men like Morris whom he had publicly denounced only a few months
   before. It does not, however, mark, as some writers have asserted, the
   beginning of a conservative trend in Paine's thinking. The simple fact is
   that the author of Common Sense had enough common sense to realize that
   the American Revolution could not be successful un- less all classes
   willing to support the war were united, and he did not exclude men of
   wealth from this unity. Paine fully appreciated what Washington had meant
   when he wrote that everything had to give way to the primary task of
   winning the war-factional disputes, class antagonisms, even personal
   quarrels. "The present situation of our public affairs," the
   commander-in-chief once observed, "affords abundant causes of distress, we
   should be very careful how we aggravate or multiply them, by private
   bickerings. . . . All little differences and animosities, calculated to
   increase the unavoidable evils of the times, should be forgotten, or at
   least postponed." 8 Paine was not merely willing to forget or postpone but
   even to cooperate with his former enemies to rescue "the fairest cause
   that Men ever engaged in."

   National unity meant unity among the states as well as among different
   classes. Paine, therefore, turned his attention late in 1780 to the
   problem of eliminating state antagonisms and rivalries in the hope that he
   could convince them to cooperate for the well-being of the entire nation.
   The immediate issue that aroused his attention was the delay in the
   ratification of the Articles of Confederation because of a conflict over
   claims to land in the west. Congress had adopted the Articles on November
   17, 1777, and submitted them to the several states for ratification.
   Maryland, having definite western limits, refused to ratify the new frame
   of government until Virginia ceded her claims to western land to the
   national government.

    

   Paine's pamphlet, Public Good, published in Philadelphia on December 30,
   1780, demolished Virginia's claims to land in the west, contended that the
   land should belong not to the individual states but to the United States
   because they had been secured by the united effort of all the states
   during the war, and concluded by calling for a stronger central
   government. He urged the convening of "a continental convention, for the
   purpose of forming a continental constitution, defining and describing the
   powers and authority of Congress."

   Two years later, in 1782-83, Paine spoke out again for a stronger central
   government and once again emphasized the need to adhere to "the principle
   of union," which he correctly regarded as "our magna charta-our anchor in
   the world of empires." In an effort to obtain a revenue to carry on the
   war Congress proposed a five-per-cent duty on imported articles, the money
   to be used to pay the interest on loans to be made in Holland. Unanimous
   consent of the states was necessary to grant Congress the power to levy
   this duty, and, when Rhode Island refused her assent an impasse was
   created. In this situation Paine once again demonstrated his grasp of the
   needs of the time by publishing a series of letters addressed to the
   people of Rhode Island urging them to consent to the five-per-cent impost
   plan. Signing himself "A Friend to Rhode Island and the Union," he
   reminded his readers that all the embarrassments faced by the new Republic
   "are ascribable to the loose and almost disjointed condition of the Union.
   . . ." We need "to talk less about our independence," he argued, "and more
   about our union." Independence without a strong union would be
   meaningless, for "the union of America is the foundation-stone of her
   independence; the rock on which it is built." It was "the great Palladium
   of our liberty and

   safety." 9

    

   To bring this message to the people of Rhode Island, Paine even went to
   the trouble to visit the state at his own expense. He made the trip in the
   dead of winter on a horse he borrowed from a friend in New Jersey.
   Unfortunately neither his presence nor his letters to the Providence
   Gazette produced any effect and he was forced to leave the state without
   accomplishing anything.

   It is clear that Paine was among the first to point out, even before the
   American Revolution was over, the need for a stronger central government
   to replace the weak Articles of Confederation. Little wonder, therefore,
   that in later years he was enraged to discover the Federalists claiming
   for themselves the sole distinction of having favored a stronger central
   government to take the place of the Articles of Confederation. He observed
   in 1802 that if "by Federalist is to be understood one who was for
   cementing the Union by a general government operating equally over all the
   States, in all matters that embraced the common interest,... I ought to
   stand first on the list of Federalist!' For had he not as early as 1780
   and 1782 recognized that "the continental belt was too loosely buckled"?

    

   At the end of the Revolution Paine found himself poverty-stricken. In a
   moving memorial to Congress, endorsed by Washington, he set forth his
   services to America and begged for financial assistance. His revolutionary
   writings had circulated widely, but he had not profited from their sale.
   Indeed, he had contributed from his own pocket to; make them available to
   as wide a reading public as possible. Referring to the phenomenal
   distribution of Common Sense, Paine wrote in his memorial : 

            "As my wish was to serve an oppressed people, and assist in a
   just and good cause, I conceived that the honor of it would be  promoted
   by my declining to make even the usual profits of an author, by the
   publication, and therefore I gave up the profits of the first edition into
   the hands of Col. Joseph Deane and Mr. Thomas Pryor both of the city of
   Philadelphia to be disposed of by them in any public service or private
   charity. After this I printed six thousand at my own expense and directed
   Mr. Bradford to sell them at the. price of the printing and paper. It may,
   perhaps, be said, that as I had made a dangerous step, it was my interest
   to make it as little so as possible by promoting by every means, the
   success of the principle on which my own safety  rested, but this would be
   an uncandid way of accounting for public spirit and conduct." 10

    

   Yet for all his public spirit and conduct he faced a desperate future. "I
   cannot help viewing my situation as singularly inconvenient," he frankly
   informed Congress. "Trade I do not understand. Land I have none, or what
   is equal to none. I have exiled myself from one country without making a
   home of another; and I cannot help sometimes asking myself, what am I
   better off than a refugee, and that of the most extraordinary kind, a
   refugee from the country I have obliged and served, to that which can owe
   me no good will."

   Paine's enemies in Congress were still too powerful and the memorial was
   buried. Fortunately, two states came to his aid. Pennsylvania gave him
   -L-500 in cash, and New York presented him with a confiscated Loyalist
   farm at New Rochelle, the last grant being recommended because "his
   literary works, and those especially under the signature of Common Sense,
   and the Crisis, inspired the citizens of this state with unanimity,
   confirmed their confidence in the rectitude of their cause, and have
   ultimately contributed to the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of
   the United States." He remained on his farm and in the village of
   Bordentown, New Jersey until 1787, devoting most of his time to inventions
   such as an iron bridge without piers, and a smokeless candle. These were
   years when he could truly say, "the natural bent of my mind was to
   science."

   Yet he could not remain entirely aloof from the political scene.
   Independence did not overnight usher in the era of national prosperity
   Paine had predicted in Common Sense. A few men, to be sure, made money
   through speculation and investments, but the mass of the small farmers and
   city mechanics found it difficult to make ends meet. The dumping of
   British goods on the American market caused a serious amount of
   unemployment in urban areas. In the rural districts the farmers faced
   foreclosures and imprisonment for debt.

   In every state the small farmers organized a campaign to obtain paper
   money and stay laws. Pennsylvania was no exception. Here, however, the
   battle for paper money legislation merged into a movement to revoke the
   charter of the Bank of North America which had grown out of the Bank of
   Pennsylvania founded by Paine, Robert Morris and a group of merchants in
   1780. The back-country farmers feared that it would be valueless to obtain
   paper money legislation if the bank was still in existence, for if the
   institution refused to accept paper money on the same terms as specie, the
   public would have no faith in the bills. Accordingly, a bill to repeal the
   bank's charter was introduced in the Pennsylvania legislature and by April
   4, 1786, passed its second reading.

    

   The pro-bank forces now rallied to defeat the repeal bill. James Wilson
   wrote a pamphlet supporting the bank, but the material was so heavy and
   couched in such complicated legal terminology that it had little popular
   appeal. This was the situation when Paine's Dissertations on Government,
   The Affairs of the Ban\\, and Paper Money came off the press in February,
   1786.

   Paine was reluctant to enter the controversy over the bank. "It was my
   intention/' he wrote to his "Old Friend," Daniel Clymer, in September,
   1786, "at the conclusion of the war to have laid down the pen and
   satisfied myself with silently beholding the prosperity of my country, in
   whose difficulties I had done my share, and in the raising of which, to an
   independent Empire, I had added my mite . . ." l1

    

   Paine did not join in the popular agitation conducted by the backcountry
   farmers in favor of paper money legislation and in opposition to the bank,
   because he believed that these measures were unwise and harmful to the
   general well-being of the country. He felt that the bank was essential for
   commercial development in Pennsylvania and that its services were
   indispensable for the growth of the state. To destroy a financial
   institution did not seem to him to be either progressive or necessary.
   "The whole community," he wrote in his Dissertations, "derives benefit
   from the operation of the bank . . ." As for paper money, it was nothing
   more than an unjust balm for those debtors who were determined to steal by
   depreciation "the widow's dowry and children's portion." In any event,
   neither a legislature nor the people had the right to revoke certain kinds
   of economic contracts agreed to by a preceding legislature and another
   party. This, however, did not mean that a contract could last forever. A
   legislature could not grant a contract forever, for the simple reason that
   the present generation could no more bind its children to economic
   contracts than it could set up a government for posterity.

   Paine knew that by joining the pro-bank forces he would invite the charge
   that he had sold out the people. Such charges were made. A representative
   from the West referred to him as "an unprincipled author, who let his pen
   out for hire," and a writer who called himself "Atticus" attacked him as a
   turn-coat, adding: "I cannot conceive in the wide extent of creation, a
   being more deserving of our abhorrence and contempt, than a writer, who
   having formerly vindicated the principles of freedom, abandons them to
   abet the cause of a faction, who exerts the little talent which Heaven has
   alloted him, . . . to vilify measures which it is his duty to respect, and
   . . . [devotes] his pen to the ruin of his country."

    

   These attacks did not halt Paine in his determination to fight the battle
   to the bitter end, and his will was strengthened by the realization that
   if the farmers had turned against him the city mechanics and artisans as
   well as merchants and bankers supported him. The urban workers also
   opposed paper money legislation fearing the effects of inflation on their
   living standards and favored the continued existence of the bank as
   essential for business expansion which meant employment opportunities. In
   a series of letters to the Philadelphia papers Paine attacked the repeal
   of the bank's charter and called for its restoration.12 In the fall
   elections of 1786 Paine's position was upheld by a majority of the voters.
   A few months later the bank's charter was restored.

   In April, 1787, Paine left for Europe to promote his plan to build a
   single-arch bridge across the Schuylkill river in Philadelphia. He
   expected to remain abroad no more than a year and to spend most of his
   time in France where engineering was best understood. He met Jefferson in
   France, was hailed as a friend of Franklin and a distinguished writer and
   became acquainted with leading scientists and political liberals. The
   Academy of Science appointed a committee to study the plans for his bridge
   and, after an investigation this body reported that "Mr. Paine's Plan of
   an Iron Bridge is ingeniously imagined, that the construction of it is
   simple, solid, and proper to give it the necessary strength for resisting
   the effects resulting from its burden, and that it is deserving of a trial
   . . ." The report was presented on August 29th. The next day Paine left
   for England.

    

   In the land of his birth Paine visited his aged mother at Thetford, met
   and was enthusiastically received by Charles Fox, Lord Landsdowne, Lord
   Shelburne and Edmund Burke, and began to make plans for the construction
   of his bridge. But soon he was thinking less and less about his bridge and
   more and more about the exciting events in France. 13 Science, after all,
   could not flourish without democracy.

   The news of the French Revolution filled Paine with joy. But he was not
   surprised. He had never regarded the American Revolution as a local
   affair, "but universal, and through which the principles of all lovers of
   mankind are affected." In his celebrated Letter to the Abbe Raynal,
   published in 1782, Paine had predicted that the American Revolution would
   influence England and France until "every corner of the mind is swept of
   its cobwebs, poison and dust, and made fit for the reception of generous
   happiness."

    

   Paine spent four months in France at the invitation of Lafayette and
   Condorcet. He gave advice on the formation of a constitution, aided in
   drawing up the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and
   witnessed the uprisings to overthrow despotism and feudal privileges. His
   heart "leaped with joy" when he received from Lafayette the key of the
   Bastille for presentation to Washington. "That the principles of America
   opened the Bastille," he wrote in his letter forwarding the key, "is not
   to be doubted, and therefore the Key comes to the right place."

   Even when he returned to England, Paine's mind was still riveted on events
   across the channel. He continued to send Lafayette suggestions to be
   incorporated in the new government, and reported on reactions in England
   to developments in France. "Here is a courtly and an aristocratical hatred
   against the principles of the French Revolution . . . ," he wrote to
   William Short, American representative in France, from London early in
   June, 1790.14

    

   In the fall of 1790 Paine returned to Paris where he mingled again with
   Brissot, Condorcet, Lafayette and other leaders of the Revolution. A
   business crisis seat him back again to England. In November he began work
   on his greatest pamphlet, The Rights of Man, in answer to Edmund Burke's
   Reflections on the French Revolution which appeared on November 1, 1790.

   Burke's speech "On Reconciliation with America" in 1775 had aroused
   Paine's admiration for the man who was considered America's greatest
   English friend. His personal contacts with Burke in England after the
   American Revolution increased this feeling, and he considered him "a
   friend to mankind." But he was both terribly shocked and speedily
   disillusioned after he read Burke's vicious denunciation of the French
   Revolution in his parliamentary speech on February 9, 1790. Soon after
   this Paine saw an advertisement of the forthcoming publication of Burke's
   pamphlet, and promised his friends in France that whenever it appeared he
   would answer it.15

    

   Paine finished the pamphlet in February, 1791, and turned it over to a
   friend, Johnson, to have it published. After a few copies were issued,
   this publisher became frightened. Paine then gave the pamphlet to a
   committee consisting of William Godwin, Thomas Holcroft, and Thomas
   Hollis, and left for France. From Paris he forwarded a preface for the
   English edition, and the work appeared on March 13, 1791. The pamphlet
   sold for three shillings, the same price as Burke's Reflections, and it
   was believed in Tory circles that this expensive format would give it a
   limited circulation.

   The pamphlet immediately gained a wide circulation. Within a few weeks the
   book sold fifty thousand copies, and on April 5th, Sir Samuel Romilly
   wrote to a friend in France that "in the course of a fortnight it has gone
   through three editions; and, what I own has a good deal surprised me, has
   made converts of many persons who were before enemies to the revolution."
   The Society for Constitutional Information and other popular societies in
   England, to whose support Paine gave the large income from the sale,
   distributed the book all over the British Isles. Soon Englishmen were
   quoting passages from the Rights of Man with as much fervor as Americans
   had once recited sections from Common Sense. Workers, small farmers and
   liberal members of the middle and upper class used Paine's words to deny
   Burke's contention of the right of the Parliament of 1688 to bind
   posterity forever to their settlement, to defend the French Revolution,
   and many even quoted him to urge Englishmen to follow the example set by
   their brothers across the channel.

    

   While popular societies in England sang Paine's praises, toasted his name
   and adopted resolutions thanking him for his "most masterly book," the
   author himself was busy in France fighting for Republicanism. Louis XVI
   had been intercepted in his flight to join the royalist emigres and had
   been brought back to Paris. On July 1, 1791, Paine and Achille Duchatelet
   placarded the streets of Paris with a manifesto which denounced the king
   and monarchy and boldly proclaimed that the time had come to establish a
   republic. A few days later Paine published in Le Re'publicain, which he
   and Condorcet had founded, an attack on the monarchy. He elaborated his
   attack on the monarchy in a public letter to the Abbe Sieyes, who had
   replied to Paine's article and had advocated the retention of the king.

   Paine returned to England on July 13, 1791. A month later he issued his
   Address and Declaration of the Friends of Universal Peace and Liberty in
   which he again defended the French Revolution. "We have nothing to
   apprehend from the poor; for we are pleading their cause," he wrote. "And
   we fear not proud oppression, for we have truth on our side. We say, and
   we repeat it, that the French Revolution opens to the world an opportunity
   in which all good citizens must rejoice-that of promoting the general
   happiness of man."

    

   After the appearance of Burke's reply to the first part of Rights of Man,
   entitled An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs, Paine started work on
   Part II of his great book. It was more of an exposition of Paine's
   principles of government and society than a reply to Burke and, as Vernon
   L. Parrington has pointed out, was "the maturest elaboration of Paine's
   political philosophy. . . ." In this work Paine analyzed the basic reasons
   for discontent in contemporary society and offered his remedy for the
   misery he saw all about him.

   "When in countries that we call civilized," he writes, "we see age going
   to the workhouse and youth to the gallows, something must be wrong in the
   system of government." "Why is it," he asks, "that scarcely any are
   executed but the poor"? Poverty and an evil environment-"lack of education
   for the young and a decent livelihood for the old" -were the reasons" for
   this unfortunate state of affairs, and these conditions prevailed because
   the government failed to provide for the happiness of the people. In
   England, of course, one could not expect the government to act otherwise,
   for it consisted only of representatives of special privileges and special
   interests. "No better reason can be given," he declares, "why the house of
   legislature should be composed entirely of men whose occupations is in
   letting landed property than why it should be composed of those who hire,
   or brewers, or bakers, or of any other separate class of men."

    

   Paine did not confine himself to advocating a reform in the composition of
   the government. He outlined a plan for popular education, for the relief
   of the poor, for pensions for aged people, for donations, or premiums, to
   be given for births and marriages, together with an allowance for funeral
   expenses of people dying out of work and away from their friends, and for
   State employment and lodging-houses to aid unemployed workingmen.

   To raise a revenue for the operation of his plan, Paine proposed the
   levying of a progressive income tax. Not only would this secure the funds
   necessary for the proper functioning of the government, but it would bring
   about the abolition of primogeniture which was both "unnatural and unjust"
   and a great waste of the national wealth.

    

   In Part II of the Rights of Man Paine also outlined his suggestions for
   peaceful and harmonious relations among nations to render wars
   unnecessary. He advocated the signing of a treaty between England, France,
   the United States and Holland under which no new ships were to be built by
   any of the signers, while their existing naval establishments were to be
   reduced one-half of their existing strength. "If men will permit
   themselves," he wrote, "to think as rational beings ought to think,
   nothing can appear more ridiculous and absurd . . . than to be at the
   expense of building navies, filling them with men, and then hauling them
   out into the ocean to see which can sink each other the fastest." Thus
   though not the first Paine was one of the earliest advocates of an
   international association of nations to outlaw war.16 He was also one of
   the first to prophesy, as he does in Part II of Rights of Man, "the
   independence of South America, and the opening of those countries of
   immense extent and wealth to the general commerce of the world."

   Part Two had a phenomenal circulation. Thirty thousand copies were
   distributed by the political clubs at their own expense among the poor.
   Although living in poverty Paine turned over to the London Constitutional
   Society the thousand pounds which he had received from royalties, enabling
   it to distribute the book even more widely. Not only did he arrange for
   the printing of a cheap edition because the original cost too much,
   thereby preventing it from reaching the common people, but he even gave up
   the copyright to the public. At least one hundred thousand copies of the
   cheap edition were sold in England, Ireland and Scotland.

    

   The influence of Rights of Man was by no means confined to England. In
   America, for example, it became the book of the hour, greatly influenced
   the rise of the Democratic-Republican Societies, and in turn was scattered
   broadcast throughout the country by these popular clubs.17 Thomas
   Jefferson welcomed the book as an antidote to the "political heresies" of
   the reactionary Federalists and, when attacked for upholding Paine's
   principles, wrote that he merited the same censure visited upon the author
   of Rights of Man, "for I profess the same principles." Philip Freneau,
   editor and poet of the Jeffersonian movement, ran excerpts from Paine's
   work in his National Gazette, and proudly announced on May 31,1792, as his
   reason that "there is no American newspaper but might, with credit to
   itself, now and then occupy part of a column with extracts from a work
   that so forcibly inculcates the genuine principles of natural and equal
   liberty." Freneau even wrote a poem entitled "Lines Occasioned by Reading
   Mr. Paine's Rights of Man," in which he assured the author that America
   would "Remain the guardian of the Rights of Man."

   In the meantime in England a storm was breaking over Paine's head. As
   Paine himself pointed out later, the first part of Rights of Man was met
   by the government with "profound silence," because they "beheld it as an
   unexpected gale that would soon blow over." When the Second Part appeared,
   they tried at first to follow the same course, but their silence had no
   "influence in stifling the progress of the work." As long, however, that
   it was published in an expensive edition they were not too worried. But
   when it began to be distributed in cheap editions at cost, the attitude
   changed. From "that moment," wrote Paine, "and not before, I expected a
   prosecution, and the event has proved that I was not mistaken."

    

   There is more to the story. At first Premier Pitt tried to prevent the
   publication of Part II by bribing the publisher. When this failed, the
   government sponsored and paid for the publication of a slanderous
   biography of Paine. Then the press began to raise the false bogey of
   Jacobinism and instituted a cry against seditious doctrines said to be
   circulated by emissaries from France who were bribed by "Paris Gold" to
   overthrow British institutions. Mobs were inspired to burn Paine in
   effigy; individuals were instructed to wear boots whose hobnails were
   marked "T.P.," so that they could trample upon Paine and his principles,
   and a great outcry was organized against "the notorious Tom Paine." A
   Royal Proclamation against seditious writings was issued on May 21, 1792,
   and on June 8 Paine himself was charged with sedition and his trial was
   set for December18.

   While British royalty was persecuting Paine, the French nation hailed him
   as their champion and claimed him for herself. During the first week of
   September he was elected to represent. Calais, Oise, Somme, and Puy de
   Dome in the National Assembly. "Come, friend of the people," they wrote
   him, "to swell the number of patriots in an assembly which will decide the
   destiny of the human race. The happy period you have predicted for the
   nation has arrived. Come! do not deceive their hopes."

    

   On September 12 Paine made a revolutionary speech to the society of the
   "Friends of Liberty." The next day, warned by the poet William Blake to
   flee at once to avoid arrest, Paine went to Dover. There he was able to
   get by the customs officials and depart for France by showing a letter
   from Washington. Twenty minutes after he got out to sea the authorities
   arrived to arrest him. He left behind in the hands of a customs officer at
   Dover "a printed proof copy" of his Letter to the Addressers which he
   wrote in the summer of 1792 in reply to the charges of seditious libel. In
   this pamphlet he boldly proceeded to inform his persecutors :

   "If to expose the fraud and imposition of monarchy and every species of
   hereditary government-to lessen the oppression of taxes-to propose plans
   for the education of helpless infancy, and the comfortable support of the
   aged and distressed-to endeavor to conciliate nations to each other-to
   extirpate the horrid practice of war-to promote universal peace,
   civilization, and commerce-and to break the chains of political
   superstition, and raise degraded man to his proper rank;-if these things
   be libellous, let me live the life of a libeller, and let the name of
   libeler be engraven on my tomb!"

    

   On December 18 Paine's Rights of Man was prosecuted in England. The author
   was found guilty of seditious libel before a pensioned judge and a packed
   jury in London. Since the defendant was absent, the English ruling classes
   had to content themselves with outlawing him.

   The defendant at this very time was receiving a rousing reception in
   France. Soon after his arrival at Calais, Paine took his seat in the
   Convention. He speedily discovered that much had happened in France since
   his last visit to the country, and much of what had happened he could not
   understand.

    

   In England Paine was associated with the extreme Left, but in France his
   associates were already becoming the Right. The Girondists, with whom
   Paine was associated, represented the bourgeoisie of France who viewed the
   Revolution as their property to be used for their profit and interests.
   They did not believe in a truly democratic government, and were mainly
   concerned with keeping the Revolution in check so that the common people
   would not have too much of a voice in affairs of state. Meanwhile, they
   were not averse to lining their own pockets through speculation,
   profiteering and sheer corruption. They frequently mouthed revolutionary
   slogans, but their conduct indicated that these were merely words. They
   used Paine and his reputation as a spokesman for the common man for their
   own purposes, and on more than one occasion pushed him forward to defend a
   program that they did not dare to advocate openly.18

   Paine does not appear to have understood much of what was taking place
   behind the scenes in France. For one thing, he knew nothing of the
   language; for another, he had never experienced a movement as advanced as
   that represented by the Jacobins, led by men like Marat, Robespierre, and
   Saint-Just. Nor for that matter did he fully grasp the changing character
   of the revolution after 1792. He did not, for example, see that a
   dictatorship of the people was necessary to save France at a time when the
   reactionary forces in Europe were uniting with counter-revolutionary
   elements inside France to destroy the revolution. Nor did he fully grasp
   the fact that the French Revolution was not and could not be merely a
   duplication of the American Revolution, for the simple reason that the
   French masses were fighting to overthrow the burden of centuries of
   oppression and tyranny, and were compelled to meet the power of reaction
   throughout Europe in their efforts to achieve their goal.

    

   Paine's difficulties in France came quickly. He arrived in Paris on
   September 19, 1792, just after the September massacres during which many
   of the Royalist conspirators in Paris had been executed. Three days later
   the Convention, responding to the demand of the Parisian masses led by the
   Jacobins, proclaimed the Republic. On September 25, in an "Address to the
   People of France," Paine congratulated the Convention "on the abolition of
   Royalty," but revealed the influence of his Girondist associations by
   deploring the terror which had been directed against the Royalists.

   The Convention had been convened primarily to draft a new constitution and
   to dispose of the case of Louis XVI. Paine was one of the nine members of
   the committee for drawing up a Constitution for France. He worked with
   Danton, Brissot, Condorcet, Sieyes and four others in writing the
   document, but it was not adopted. Soon afterwards he invited the enmity of
   the Jacobins by his opposition to the execution of Louis XVI.

    

   After it was revealed during his trial that the king had been conspiring
   with the French emigres and the courts of Europe to wage war upon the
   people of France, the Jacobins demanded the death of the king as a traitor
   to the country. Having failed to avoid the trial, and having been defeated
   in their maneuvers to adjourn it, the Girondists sought to soften the
   verdict on the king. The Girondist leaders themselves did not dare to
   oppose the death penalty directly, but left it to less important speakers
   to propose banishment or internment.

   In taking his stand in opposition to the execution of the king, Paine was
   unconsciously doing just what the Girondist leaders wanted him to do. But
   he had his own reasons for taking his stand. Nor did he share the
   Girondist attitude on every aspect of the problem. In his letter to the
   President of the Convention, November 20, 1792, Paine had urged that
   "Louis Capet" be tried for his role in the conspiracy of the "crowned
   brigands" against liberty. This was hardly in keeping with the Girondist
   position at this time. On January 14, 1793, when voting took place on the
   Girondist proposal that the question of the king's fate be referred to the
   people, Paine voted with the Mountain (Jacobins) against his own party.
   When he arose in the Convention to make his plea against the execution of
   the king (it was read for him in French to the delegates), he made it
   clear that he did not do so out of any deference to Royalty but because he
   feared that the execution would give England a useful pretext for
   declaring war against France, and because he still could not forget that
   the king had once aided America to gain her independence. He pleaded with
   the delegates that they should not give "the tyrant of England the triumph
   of seeing the man perish on the scaffold who had aided my much-beloved
   America to break his chains."

    

   On January 19,1793, the Convention heard an address in opposition to the
   execution delivered for Paine by a delegate who had translated it from the
   original. Marat interrupted the speaker to charge that the translation was
   incorrect and that the sentiments could not be those of Paine. The
   incident revealed that troubled times were in store for Paine.

   When the Girondists were overthrown by the Mountain, Paine attended fewer
   and fewer meetings of the Convention, and after June 2 ceased altogether
   to appear in the legislative body. Not understanding that the party with
   which he had been allied had brought misery and hardship upon the people
   of France, he could not be expected to grasp the necessity for the new
   radical measures introduced by the Jacobins to cope with enemies of the
   revolution at home and abroad.

    

   Although Robespierre and his associates took action against most of
   Paine's former friends directly after the Girondists were overthrown, they
   did not arrest him until December 28, 1793. And then it is more than
   likely that had not Gouverneur Morris, the American minister to France
   from 1792 to 1794, conspired to keep Paine imprisoned, he would have been
   speedily released. After his arrest Paine appealed to his rights as an
   American citizen,19 but Morris, who hated both Paine and his writings and
   the French Revolution, turned a deaf ear. As one of Morris's biographers
   puts it: "But the American minister was too clever to let such a fish
   escape. He told Robespierre that he did not acknowledge Mr. Paine's right
   to pass as an American." 20 He had also intimated to the Jacobins, who
   were anxious to gain the support of America against England, that Paine
   was thoroughly disliked in America and that the United States would not be
   disturbed if Paine were kept in prison. Meanwhile, Morris let his own
   government believe that he had done everything possible to help Paine. Not
   realizing the role the American minister was playing with respect to the
   government of the United States, Paine later placed the blame for his
   prolonged stay in prison on Washington and in his Letter to the President
   launched a bitter attack charging him with having deserted both his former
   friend and supporter and the cause of freedom.

   Paine remained in the Luxembourg prison until November 4, 1794. He
   expected every day would be his last on earth, and it is probable that he
   was once saved from the guillotine by the mistake of a guard in marking
   his door. He nearly died because of an ulcer in his side and was more dead
   than alive when rescued from prison by James Monroe who replaced Morris as
   American minister to France. Even ten months after his release Monroe, who
   nursed Paine at his own home, did not believe he would live long. "The
   symptoms have become worse," Monroe wrote on September 15, 1795, "and the
   prospect now is that he will not be able to hold out more than a month or
   two at the farthest. I shall certainly pay the utmost attention to this
   gentleman, as he is one of those whose merits in our Revolution were most
   distinguished."

    

   Paine eventually recovered, was readmitted to the convention in 1795,
   offered a pension which he refused, and remained in France until September
   1, 1802, when he sailed for the United States.

   On his way to prison, December 28, 1793, Paine delivered into the hands of
   his friend Joel Barlow a manuscript which when published in English in
   1794 brought upon him a barrage of vituperation that has lasted until the
   present day. The work was the first part of The Age of Reason. Part II was
   written during his stay in Monroe's home after his release from prison.

    

   Written when Paine was in his fifty-seventh year, The Age of Reason
   represented the results of years of study and reflection by its author on
   the place of religion in society. When, at the age of twenty, he attended
   lectures in London on Newtonian astronomy, he must have been influenced by
   the thought that as Newton found the laws which govern the world of
   physics so man could find the laws which govern society by observing
   nature. Again, he probably reached the conclusion some time later that
   since the clergy in many countries were on the side of oppression and
   served the vested interests in the interest of reaction, it was essential
   for the future of progress that their influence be destroyed. As early as
   Common Sense in 1776, he writes that he "saw the exceeding probability
   that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a
   revolution in the system of religion." Although he says nothing in Rights
   of Man about the need for this "revolution in the system of religion," he
   makes it clear that the idea was still with him. He states that he has
   avoided the subject "because I am inclined to believe that what is called
   the present ministry wish to see contention about religion kept up to
   prevent the nation turning its attention to subjects of government."

   During his stay in France, Paine became convinced that it was no longer
   possible to avoid the subject. As he noticed the reactionary activities of
   the clergy as plotters against the Revolution, he became even more
   convinced that to preserve republican principles it was necessary to
   destroy the priesthood. He was also worried by the fact that in their
   hatred of the counter-revolutionary role played by the clergy the people
   of France "were running headlong into Atheism . . ." At one stroke he
   might save the true religion, Deism, from atheism and republicanism from
   despotism. With this in mind he wrote his famous theological treatise.

    

   Thomas Paine was no Atheist, Theodore Roosevelt to the contrary. Together
   with the foremost liberals and intellectuals in America and Europe, he
   believed in Deism. 21 And like many of these thinkers, Franklin,
   Jefferson, Wollaston, etc., he was influenced by the intellectual
   revolution achieved by Newton and Locke in their discovery of a systematic
   and harmonious universe whose laws could be ascertained by human reason.
   After seeing the application of the light of rationalism in the political
   revolutions in America and in France, it seemed to him that the next step
   was to apply this same rationalism in religion. In his Letter to Erskjne,
   Paine wrote: "Of all the tyrannies that effect mankind, tyranny in
   religion is the worst; every other species of tyranny is limited to the
   world we live in; but this attempts to stride beyond the grave, and seeks
   to pursue us into eternity."

   Paine's views about the Bible and religion were in no sense original for
   every one of them had been expressed by Deists before him. But these men
   had written heavy treatises for scholars. Paine wrote in his usual simple
   and clear language for the common man. He took Deism out of the sphere of
   academic discussions and made it a living creed for the average man. By
   doing so, of course, he threatened the hold of the clergy upon the people.
   As long as Deism was confined to intellectuals in the upper middle class
   and liberal sections of the nobility there was no danger to the vested
   interests of the priesthood. But once it became, as it did after the
   publication of The Age of Reason, a subject for discussion among the
   common people, the outlook was entirely different. Men, who had said many
   times before the same things Paine set down in his work, had been ignored.
   Paine was forced to endure a barrage of calumny and vituperation such as
   has been visited upon few men in our history.

    

   In one other respect Paine was different from others who had written on
   the subject. He did not bother to use diplomatic language in expressing
   the things he did not believe and the reasons for his disbelief in them.
   As he himself said, he went "marching through the Christian forest with an
   axe." And as he marched through the Christian forest he destroyed with his
   axe the stories of creation, the garden of Eden, the Resurrection,
   Mysteries and Miracles, prophecies and Prophets, and everything else
   through to Revelation, basing all his arguments on science and reason.
   After completing his journey through the forest, he concludes: "Of all the
   systems of religion that ever were invented, there is none more derogatory
   to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and
   more contradictory to itself than this thing called Christianity." All
   this does not mean, however, that Paine denies the greatness of Jesus as a
   man. "Nothing that is said here can apply," he writes, "even with the most
   distant disrespect, to the real character of Jesus Christ. He was a
   virtuous and amiable man. The morality that he preached and practised was
   of the most benevolent kind . . ."

   Paine's entire religious creed is put quite simply. By unaided reason man
   could know that there is a God, that he has certain duties toward Him and
   his fellow-man, and that the performance of these duties made for his
   welfare in the present life and hereafter. He ends his work on a note of
   hope: "Certain . . . I am that when opinions are free, either in matters
   of government or religion, truth will finally and powerfully prevail." He
   could not foresee that there were those who were not interested in
   allowing opinions to be free and, because he transformed Deism from an
   aristocratic into a popular movement, would make life miserable for him.

    

   In the winter of 1795-96, shortly after he completed the second part of
   The Age of Reason, and while he was still at the home of Monroe in Paris,
   Paine wrote his last great pamphlet, Agrarian Justice. The work resulted
   from two separate motivating factors. Paine wished, in the first place, to
   answer a sermon printed by the Bishop of Llandaff, on "The wisdom and
   goodness of God in having made both rich and poor." He dismissed this
   remark with the statement that God "made only male and female, and gave
   them the earth for their inheritance." He was also moved to write his
   pamphlet by the struggle in France over the confiscation of emigre
   property. After the local communes had initiated a campaign to enforce the
   laws calling for the confiscation of such property, the Directory,
   representing the bourgeoisie who had engineered the overthrow of
   Robespierre, put a stop to this procedure. At the same time a movement was
   initiated by the Directory to crush the remnants of the radical forces
   among the masses to pave the way for the unchallenged rule of the upper
   classes. In an effort to overthrow the counter-revolution and to seize
   power to wield it against the upper classes, the radical forces, led by
   Babeuf, made preparations for a coup d'etat. Included in the program of
   the Babouvists were the demands for the abolition of inheritance and the
   confiscation of the properties of counter-revolutionists, of those who had
   accumulated wealth from public office, of persons who neglected to
   cultivate their lands, and of individuals who lived without working. The
   conspiracy was discovered and crushed in May, 1796.

   This was the situation when Paine's Agrarian Justice was published. He did
   not go as far as Babeuf, although he approved of the objective of the
   insurrection in aiming to remove social inequalities in property. Paine
   held that there were two kinds of property: natural property (the earth in
   its uncultivated stage), and "improved" property. He had no intention of
   taking away "improved" property, but argued that the "earth, in its
   natural uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the
   common property of the human race!' The introduction of private property
   added, through cultivation, a "tenfold" value to created earth. At the
   same time, however, it "dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of
   every nation of their natural inheritance, without providing . . . an
   indemnification for that loss, and has thereby created a species of
   poverty and wretchedness that did not exist before." To remedy this
   situation and assist the persons thus dispossessed, Paine maintained that
   every proprietor "of cultivated land" owed to the community a ground-rent
   for the land which he held. With this sum Paine aimed to set up a National
   Fund, out of which there would be paid to every person, "when arrived at
   the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen pounds sterling, as a
   compensation in part, for the loss of his or her natural inheritance, by
   the system of landed property," and "the sum of ten pounds per annum,
   during life, to every person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to
   all others as they shall arrive at that age."

    

   The system he proposed, Paine maintained, would so organize civilization
   "that the whole weight of misery can be removed." It would aid the blind,
   the lame and the aged poor, and at the same time guarantee that the new
   generation would never become poor. And all this would not be achieved
   through charity. "It is not charity, but a right," he cried, "not bounty
   but justice, that I am pleading for." 22 In a burst of indignation over
   the exploitation of workingmen by employers, he wrote: ". . . if we
   examine the case minutely it will be found that the accumulation of
   personal property is, in many instances, the effect of paying too little
   for the labour that produced it; the consequence of which is, that the
   working hand perishes in old age, and that the employer abounds in
   affluence."

   Paine remained in France despite his dislike for the reaction that set in
   with the Directory and continued during Napoleon's Consulate. He felt that
   France deserved enthusiastic support for seeking to end feudalism and
   autocracy, and was convinced that even though democracy was not developing
   as completely as he had hoped, the basic advances of the Revolution in
   destroying feudal privileges would remain. France was still to him,
   therefore, the revolutionary republic of Europe and as such merited the
   assistance of all true democrats, especially in its efforts to defeat
   England which Paine regarded as the bulwark of reaction in the western
   world. Britain's defeat in war, he was convinced, would end the rule of
   the English aristocracy, and pave the way for a democratic republic in
   England which, in alliance with the United States and France, would
   guarantee the spread of republicanism throughout the world and
   international peace. "There will be no lasting peace for France, nor for
   the world," wrote Paine, "until the tyranny and corruption of the English
   government be abolished, and England, like Italy, become a sister
   republic."

    

   Paine submitted a plan to the French Directory for a military expedition
   against England, whose purpose would be to overthrow the monarchy and
   assist the people to proclaim a democratic republic. Napoleon, who had not
   yet revealed his plans of becoming a military dictator, received Paine's
   proposal enthusiastically and even visited the writer to discuss the
   possibilities. Paine himself contributed funds he could hardly spare
   toward the expedition, but it never materialized.

   Eventually Paine realized that his usefulness in France was over. He was
   not molested under the Consulate, but his democratic views such as his
   support of the Haitian revolution led by Touissant L'Ouverture and his
   agitation against the slave trade, were looked upon unfavorably. He waited
   to return to the country which had made him an author.

    

   The fifteen years Paine had spent in Europe since his departure from
   America had been crowded with world-shaking events, and in most of them he
   had been an active participant. He had seen the French Revolution uproot
   hallowed traditions, sweep away feudal remnants and revolutionize class
   and property relations. He had witnessed the up- surge of the
   revolutionary movement in England and saw how it was pulverized after
   Pitt's repressive laws of 1796. He had not fully understood the need for
   stern measures adopted by the people in meeting and defeating
   counter-revolution, and his prediction of an easy triumph for republican
   principles had not been realized. But his faith in the people and the
   cause of democracy was still unshaken. The measures adopted by the people
   in their striving for freedom had caused many liberals to blanch and
   revise their ideas. But they had left his convictions undisturbed. He
   returned to America convinced that in the end freedom would triumph all
   over the world.

   Soon after his inauguration as President in 1801, Jefferson wrote Paine a
   cordial letter inviting him to return to the United States on the American
   warship, Maryland, the honored guest of the nation he had helped to found.
   He assured Paine that the attitude of his presidential predecessors
   towards him had not been a true reflection of the sentiment of a grateful
   nation. "I am in hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments
   worthy of former times," wrote Jefferson. "In these it will be your glory
   steadily to have laboured, and with as much effect as any man living. That
   you may long live to continue your useful labours, and to reap their
   reward in the thankfulness of nations, is my sincere prayer. Accept
   assurances of my high esteem and affectionate attachment."

    

   Paine sailed from France on September 1 and landed at Baltimore on October
   30, 1802. He was hailed by the Jeffersonians and especially by the
   advocates of Deism, the "Republican Religion." But the Federalists, the
   reactionary clergy and others in the anti-democratic camp began the vile
   attack upon him that was to follow him to his grave. Every paper, Paine
   wrote to a friend in London, was "filled with applause or abuse."

   The abuse, however, soon drowned out the applause. The Federalists hated
   everything Paine stood for, and they did not forget that he had vigorously
   denounced Washington and condemned the Alien and Sedition laws of the
   Adams administration. But primarily they considered his return as a useful
   stick with which to beat and possibly defeat the Jeffersonians. Hence the
   Federalist press began a campaign of vilification that probably has no
   equal in our history. As one student has put it, "the reactionary press
   exhausted the resources of the dictionary to express the unutterable, only
   to sink back at last with impotent rage." These newspapers called Paine
   "the scavenger of faction," "lilly-livered sinical rogue," "loathsome
   reptile," "demi-human archbeast," "an object of disgust, of abhorrence, of
   absolute loathing to every decent man except the President of the United
   States." "What! invite to the United States that lying, drunken, brutal
   infidel," cried the New England Palladium of Boston, "who rejoices in the
   opportunity of basking and wallowing in the confusion, devastation,
   bloodshed, rapine and murder, in which his soul delights?" The
   Philadelphia Portfolio urged "every honest and insulted man of dignity . .
   . to shake off the very dust of his feet and to abandon America" the
   moment "the loathsome Thomas Paine" started to express his views in this
   country.23

    

   Even Paine's former friends in America began to avoid him. Samuel Adams
   broke off his friendship and Benjamin Rush refused to have anything to do
   with him, both giving as their reason that the principles set forth in The
   Age of Reason were too "offensive." For a time Paine even thought that
   Jefferson had turned against him. When the President postponed their
   meeting after his arrival in Washington, Paine wrote to Jefferson asking
   him to return his models. He had hoped, he added, to discuss his
   scientific plans with the President: "But you have not only shown no
   disposition towards it, but have, in some measure, by a sort of shyness,
   as if you stood in fear of federal observation, precluded it. I am not the
   only one, who makes observations of this kind."

   Jefferson replied immediately assuring Paine that he was mistaken and only
   the fact that he had been busy had prevented their meeting. Praising his
   models, the President went on: "You have certainly misunderstood what you
   deem shyness. Of that I have not a thought towards you, but on the
   contrary have openly maintained in conversation the duty of showing our
   respect to you and of defying federal calumny in this as in other cases by
   doing what is Right. As to fearing it, if I ever could have been weak
   enough for that, they have taken care to cure me of it thoroughly." 24

    

   Paine visited Jefferson and discussed political and scientific issues. He
   refused to accept any public office, but continued to advise the President
   through correspondence on many important political issues of the day as
   well as to supply him with ideas on the European situation based on his
   rich experience abroad. Most of his time, however, was devoted to activity
   in aiding Elihu Palmer promote the religion of Deism in New York. He
   contributed articles and letters to the Prospect expanding some of the
   themes he had touched upon in The Age of Reason. It was unfortunate in one
   sense that he concentrated so largely upon religious issues, for it
   rendered his political activities less useful. But he was forced to
   elaborate his position to clear himself of unjustified charges, and he
   believed that the struggle against the reactionary clergy was essential
   for the further progress of the Jeffersonian cause in America.

   But the campaign of slander increased the more he ventured to attack the
   strong-hold of reaction. On one occasion, when he tried to engage passage
   from New York to Trenton, the stagedriver refused him a seat. "My stage
   and horses were once struck by lightning, and I don't want him to suffer
   again," he told Paine to the amusement of his well-to-do passengers. Later
   a singer in a New York Presbyterian church was suspended for having
   visited him. His moderate appetite for brandy was distorted into
   drunkenness by cartoonists and writers. In 1806 came the greatest
   effrontery of all when he was denied the right to vote by Federalist
   officials in New Rochelle on the charge that he was not an American
   citizen.

    

   Although he led an increasingly harried life, Paine enjoyed the company of
   "the laboring class of emigrants," and spent many enjoyable days with
   Robert Fulton, who shared his democratic views, observing his steamboat
   experiments on the Hudson. For several months in the winter of 1807 he
   lived with John Wesley Jarvis. The painter wrote to a friend on May 2nd,
   "I have had Tom Paine living with me for these five months. He is one of
   the most pleasant companions I have met with for an old man." 25

   Paine spent his last years in poverty. Broken in health and reduced in
   finances, he was forced to move to a miserable lodging house on Fulton
   Street in New York City. Just before he died on June 8, 1809, two
   clergymen gained access to his room hoping to hear him recant his
   heresies. To their question concerning his religious opinions, Paine
   simply said: "Let me alone; good morning."

    

   Paine was buried on his farm in New Rochelle. But even in the grave it was
   not considered fitting that the great, militant democrat, Thomas Paine,
   should enjoy peace and dignity. Curiosity-seekers desecrated his
   tombstone, and twenty years after his death, William Cobbett, the English
   reformer who had once joined in the campaign of vilification, stole
   Paine's bones and shipped them to England. Sometime later the remains
   disappeared. "As to his bones," wrote Moncure Daniel Conway, "no man knows
   the place of their rest to this day. His principles rest not. His
   thoughts, untraceable like his dust, are blown about the world which he
   held in his heart." 26

   Three years before his death, in a letter to the mayor of Philadelphia,
   Paine summarized these principles:

    

      "My motive and object in all my political works, beginning with Common
   Sense, the first work I ever published, have been to rescue man from
   tyranny and false systems and false principles of government, and enable
   him to be free, and establish government for himself; and I have borne my
   share of danger in Europe and in America in every attempt I have made for
   this purpose. And my motive and object in all my publications on religious
   subjects, beginning with the first part of the Age of Reason, have been to
   bring man to a right reason that God has him; to impress on him the great
   principles of divine morality, justice, mercy, and a benevolent
   disposition to all men and to all creatures; and to excite in him a spirit
   of trust, confidence and consolation in his creator, unshackled by the
   fable and fiction of books, by whatever invented name they may be called.
   I am happy in the continual contemplation of what I have done, and I thank
   God that he gave me talents for the purpose and fortitude to do it. It
   will make the continual consolation of my departing hours, whenever they
   finally arrive."

   For years following his death Paine remained forgotten by so-called
   respectability. But in working class circles he was remembered. Paine's
   birthday was celebrated annually by the early American labor movement, and
   toasts were regularly offered in honor of "The author of Common Sense and
   the Crisis: His Rights of Man effective artillery for tearing down rotten
   Despotisms; his Agrarian Justice excellent material for building up
   democratic and social republics." 27 The working-men who attended the
   annual celebration of Paine's birthday could recite his works from memory,
   and in their homes copies of these books and pamphlets were handed down
   from generation to generation. They loved this hard-hitting pamphleteer
   who had fought the people's fight against tyranny, and they understood
   what he had meant when he had said, "My country is the world: to do good,
   my religion."

    

   Today Thomas Paine is just beginning to receive the homage due him. The
   studies of the late Professor Parrington, whose essay on Paine in his The
   Colonial Mind, 1620-1800 is one of the best, and of Professor Harry Hayden
   Clark, whose extensive examinations of Paine's economic religious and
   political theories are replete with meaning, have contributed vastly to
   break down the tradition of the religious infidel and the ignoramus who
   was merely a flowery demagogue. This is as it should be, for Paine merits
   a lasting place in the democratic tradition. Like Jefferson he believed in
   the dignity of the common man, and with Jefferson urged that all men
   should have an equal opportunity to shape their own destinies and the
   destiny of the world in which they lived. Those who honor Jefferson as the
   Father of Democracy would do well to remember that he professed "the same
   principles" as those expounded by Paine in the Rights of Man.

   "No writer," Jefferson observed in 1821, "has exceeded Paine in ease and
   familiarity of style, in perspicuity of expression, happiness of
   elucidation, and in simple and unassuming language." Paine's writings
   inspired men of his day in America, in England and in France to live and
   die for freedom, and left behind in these countries a vision of a world of
   men free in body and mind. At a time when men and women are fighting to
   realize that type of world it would be well to read again the words of
   Thomas Paine who wrote so much and so well to build the heritage of
   freedom we are battling to preserve and extend.

   FOOTNOTES

    

   1

   Moncure Daniel Conway, Paine's indefatigable biographer, contended that
   the most important source for his religious and many of his political
   ideas was Quakerism. It is generally conceded today by Paine scholars that
   Conway greatly exaggerated this influence.

   Professor Harry Hayden Clark, the most important student of Paine since
   Conway, argues that Paine's religious concepts and even many of his
   economic and social ideas had their source in the Newtonian concept of the
   universe. Although Professor Clark had made a great contribution to the
   study of Paine in revealing the Newtonian influence on his thought, it is
   the opinion of the present writer that he has erred in the same manner
   that Conway did by overemphasizing this influence. Certainly Professor
   Clark succeeds only in turning Paine upside down when he argues that his
   political ideas grew out of his religious ideas. See his important
   article, "Toward a Reinterpretation of Thomas Paine," American Literature,
   vol. V, May, 1933, pp. 133-145, and his valuable introduction to Thomas
   Paine: Representative Selections, New York, 1944.

   Paine argued that France would aid America if she declared herself
   independent. Common Sense was itself an important factor in helping
   mobilize French support for the American cause. It was translated promptly
   into French, with the expurgation of anti- monarchist passages, and
   published in Paris on May 4, 1776. Silas Deane, American Commissioner to
   France, wrote home on August 18, 1776, that the booklet "has a greater
   run, if possible here than in America." Professor Aulard, historian of the
   French Revolution, has observed that "the bold phrases of Thomas Paine's
   republican pamphlet, Common Sense, resounded throughout France." See "The
   Deane Papers . . . ," New York. Historical Society Collections, vol. I, p.
   214, and A. Aulard, The French Revolution: A Political History, London,

   Paine's role in supporting the bank and in calling for a stronger Union
   has been cited by several recent students as proof of his conservatism
   before he left America in 1787, and it is argued that during this period
   he tended to align himself with men like Hamilton, John Adams, Robert
   Morris and others who were known as conservatives (see Harry Hayden
   Clark's introduction to Six New Letters of Thomas Paine and J. Dorfman,
   "The Economic Philosophy of Thomas Paine," Political Science Quarterly,
   vol. LIII, September,1938- pp.37 2 ~386). Neither of these writers take
   into account the fact that Paine's views were supported by the urban
   artisans for whom he was a spokesman. Moreover, to argue that Paine's
   economic objectives were much the same as Hamilton's is entirely to ignore
   the fact that Paine, even in the bank controversy, wanted property to
   serve the welfare of all classes in society, while Hamilton always spoke
   out for protection only for the "rich and well-born." See the excellent
   refutation of J. Dorfman's contention by Howard Penniman in the American
   Political Science Review, vol. XXXVII, April, 1943, pp. 244-262.

   Although Paine and Hamilton both supported a stronger central government
   at this time, it must be remembered that the former, like Jefferson, did
   so because he believed that it was necessary to preserve Republicanism in
   America. He certainly would never have favored the type of central
   government proposed by Hamilton in the Federal Convention. Evidently the
   Hamiltonians thought so too, for they were not anxious to have Paine
   attend the Convention. Unlike some present-day writers they did not regard
   him as a conservative.

   Paine's bridge was eventually constructed in England, but he himself
   received no credit for it and made no profits. When Sir Robert Smyth,
   Paine's friend, attempted to secure some reward for the original inventor,
   he received a letter from a subscriber to the construction company
   admitting that "the first idea was taken from Mr. Paine's bridge exhibited
   at Paddington." Nothing, however, could be done to compensate Mr. Paine.

   Burke's impassioned Reflections on the French Revolution also called forth
   replies from writers like Mary Wollstonecraft, James Mackintosh, Joel
   Barlow and William Godwin. All of them like Paine argued that governmental
   institutions were not sacred and unalterable. For a discussion of these
   booklets, see Walter P. Hall, British Radicalism, 1791-97, New York, 1912
   and C. H. Lockett, The Relations of French and English Society, 1763-1793,

   Paine first presented his views on the value of an international
   association of nations to preserve peace in his Letter to the Abbe Raynal.
   This work may be said to mark an important transition in Paine's thinking
   in the sense that after it he began to think more and more in
   internationalist terms. See Darrel Abel, "The Significance of the 'Letter
   to the Abbe Raynal' in the Progress of Thomas Paine's Thought,"
   Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, vol. LXVI, April, 1942,
   pp. 176-190.

   In his excellent study of these popular societies Eugene P. Link says that
   it was "the internationalist Thomas Paine who deserves the credit for
   fathering the democratic societies." See his Democratic-Republican

   Dorfman (op.cit. p. 380) argues that in Agrarian Justice Paine was
   primarily concerned with the protection of property from the dangerous
   masses and sought to convince the property-holders to give up some of
   their holdings in order that they might be able to save the rest. This
   rather than the improvement of the condition of the poor was his aim, he
   concludes. A mere reading of the book reveals how unjustified is this
   conclusion. See, however, Penniman, op.cit., p. 251, for an abler
   refutation of this conclusion.

   Frencau predicted as much in his poem, Stanzas, At the Decease of Thomas
   Paine . . . ;

    "Princes and kings decay and die

   And, instant rise again:

   But this is not the case, trust me

   With men like THOMAS PAINE.

   "To tyrants and the tyrant crew,

   Indeed, he was the bane:

   He writ, and gave them all their due,

   And signed it-THOMAS PAINE.

   "Oh! how we loved to see him write

   And curb the race of Cain!

   They hope and wish that Thomas P

   May never rise again.

   "What idle hopes!-yes-such a man

   May yet appear again.-

   When they are dead, they die for aye:

   Not so with THOMAS PAINE."
