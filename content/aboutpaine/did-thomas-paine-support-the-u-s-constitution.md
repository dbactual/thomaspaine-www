   He favored the idea of the Constitution to establish the government (it
   was his idea in 1783), but he strongly argued against the conservative and
   elitist nature of it.  He attacked two major areas: a single executive,
   and a two-body legislature, one being smaller and more powerful than the
   other. He favored only a representative legislative body based on
   universal suffrage, which should be divided into two, then have separate
   votes taken and combine the total. He scoffed at the idea that 50
   privileged men could defeat the will of the hundreds of other legislators.
   He also believed that the real strength of the Constitution lay in the
   ability to rewrite it at the will of the people. So he was no originalist.
