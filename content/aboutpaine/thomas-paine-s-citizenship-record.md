   Foreword
    
      In recognition of the valuable services of Thomas Paine during the
   American Revolution, the State of New York presented him with a
   confiscated farm of approximately three hundred acres located in the town
   of New Rochelle. After an absence of seventeen years in Europe, Paine
   returned in the year 1802 to live for a time on this farm. During his
   residence there, he tried to vote in the village of New Rochelle and his
   ballot was refused on the ground that he was no longer a citizen of this
   country.
      To assemble and analyze the facts concerning this incident the Thomas
   Paine National Historical Association has been fortunate in receiving from
   Mr. Thomas D. Scoble, Jr. an article which is presented herewith. Mr.
   Scoble is an attorney living in New Rochelle and is recognized as an
   authority on common law. His article is the product of a long period of
   intensive research and the Association is indebted to him for this service

   Thomas Paine's Citizenship Record

    

      When Elisha Ward, an Election Inspector of New Rochelle, New York,
   challenged Thomas Paine the right to vote in the election of 1806 on the
   ground that Paine was not a citizen of the United States at that time, he
   started a controversy which has created an erroneous opinion in many lay
   minds requiring extensive legal research to correctly resolve.
      Questions of citizenship, naturalization, domicile and even residence
   do present perplexing problems in the field of law. But the soundness of
   Ward's challenge or its baseless character may be reasonably determined
   to-day by, marshaling the pertinent facts on the one hand and then
   applying the law as it then existed to the established facts.
    
   Facts
    
   English birth and residence.
    
      Paine was born in 1737, in the Village of Thetford, County of Norfolk,
   England. He was at one time in the English public service, serving as an
   excise or customs inspector.
    
   American residence and activity from 1774 to 1787.
    
      In September, 1774 he sailed for the United States and landed at
   Philadelphia Nov. 30, 1774 where he took up residence and became editor of
   the Pennsylvania Magazine, through introductions secured from Benjamin
   Franklin.
      In January, 1776 he wrote the pamphlet Common Sense which is credited
   with crystalizing American opinion for independence from England. The
   pamphlet was the first to use the phrase "Free and Independent states of
   America" and its circulation was so widespread that Paine became the most
   notable writer in the Colonies at that time. As a citizen of the State of
   Pennsylvania in 1776, he took the oath of abjuration to the British king
   and the oath of allegiance to America.
      He entered the military service of the colonies in July 1776, as
   secretary to General Roberdau, of Philadelphia; later he was a ide-de-camp
   of General Nathaniel Greene, who introduced him to Washington. A few days
   before the attack on Trenton, he published the first of a series of morale
   building pamphlets known collectively as The Crisis. The second issue in
   this series used the phrase, "United States" for the first recorded time.
      These patriotic writings were so widely read and stimulating to the
   patriotic cause that Paine won the highest esteem of Washington,
   Jefferson, Franklin, Hancock, Madison, Monroe and every leader of the
   Revolution. He is credited with inspiring a substantial part of the
   Declaration of Independence, and, subsequently, of the United States
   Constitution.
      When Congress formed the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Paine was
   elected its secretary on nomination by John Adams. On this appointment he
   again took the oath of allegiance to the United States, administered to
   him by John Hancock, "President of Congress".  This office was held by
   Paine until January 8, 1779. He became Clerk of the Pennsylvania Assembly
   Nov. 2, 1779.
      From 1782 to 1787 he also served as public relations counselor for the
   United States at a salary of $8oo per year, an appointment made by a
   committee composed of Robert Morris, Supt. of Finance, Robert Livingston,
   Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and Washington.
      As reward for his patriotic services, the State of New York, in 1784
   granted to Paine a farm of some 277 aces in the Town of New Rochelle. The
   public record of this grant expressly states that it was made in
   recognition of Paine's great patriotic services. The farm had formerly
   belonged to a Tory whose treason caused the title to the land to revert to
   the State. Paine lived on the farm at various periods, held title to it to
   his death. While away from it he frequently expressed his intention to
   return to it. It constitutes an important element in fixing not only
   Paine's United States citizenship, but his citizenship in the State of New
   York after 1784.
      In addition to the above specified public acknowledgements of Paine's
   patriotic work, the State of Pennsylvania in December, 1784 paid him a
   gratuity of. 5oo pounds and on Oct.7, 1783 a resolution was passed in
   Congress instructing the U. S. Treasurer to pay him $3,000 for his
   services the Revolution.
      These facts are so clearly established as to require no reference or
   documentation: they are largely matters of public record and accepted
   without controversy by Paine's numerous biographers.
    
   Residence in France and England, from l787 to 1802.
    
      In 1785, Paine became actively interested in various inventions, in
   addition to his public services and writings on many topics. One was a new
   design of an iron bridge. His attempt to have this design adopted for
   bridging the Schuylkill, a structure some 400 feet long, without central
   piers, was championed by Franklin, but turned down by the Assembly as
   unproven in design and calling for far too much iron, a total of 520 tons.
      To secure scientific approval of the bridge design, Paine, in a letter
   to Franklin dated March 31, 1787, requested introductions to French
   leaders in order to secure its examination by the French Academy of
   Sciences. In this letter he definitely stated in regard to the
   Pennsylvania Committee engaged in inquiry into the merits of the bridge:
   "The matter will remain suspended until my return next winter."  This is
   evidence of his purpose to leave the country only temporarily and of his
   intention to return as soon as his business was accomplished.
      He sailed for Paris on April 26, 1787, and with the aid of Thomas
   Jefferson, then American Ambassador to France, succeeded in having his
   bridge design submitted to the Academy of Sciences which approved it.
   Paine then left Paris and went to England to further secure the approval
   of the Royal Society in London of his bridge and to visit his aged mother.
   He returned to Paris in December, 1787, after applying for English patents
   on the bridge.
      He spent much of the first six months of 1788 attempting unsuccessfully
   to sell his bridge to the French for spanning the Seine. In August, 1789,
   he returned to England, secured his bridge patent in September and tried
   to promote the construction of a bridge there. In a letter to Jefferson
   dated September 15, 1789, referring to Jefferson's impending return to
   America he stated, "I feel a craving desire to return and I can scarcely
   forbear weeping at the thought of your going and my staying behind."
      In 1789, a display model of his bridge was actually set up in London
   but in December of that year, he returned to Paris where the French
   Revolution was then under way. In March, 1790, he returned to London.
      Lafayette, an admirer of Paine of long standing, had acquired the key
   of the Bastille when the revolutionists stormed the fortress in July of
   1789. Lafayette desired to send the key to Washington as an historic
   symbol and selected Paine as his emissary, on Paine's statements of his
   intention to return. The key was turned over to Paine in February, 1790,
   who took it to London.
      On May 1, 1790, Paine wrote Washington regarding the key but sent it by
   an American vessel, regretting his inability to bring it personally,
   stating, "I shall not be able to see my
   much loved America till next Spring."
      In July 1790, he returned to France but to again went back London in
   October to promote his bridge business. In April, 1791 Paine returned to
   Paris und, with Concordet, Brissot, Achelle Duchalet and Nicholas
   Bonneville, he formed the Societe Republicaine which had as its object the
   establishment of a French Republic. In mid-July, he went back to London
   but returned . to Paris again in 1792.
    
   Honorary French Citizenship Conferred in 1792
    
      On August 26, 1792, the French National Assembry conferred the honorary
   title of French citizen on Paine, voting the same honorary title to
   Washington, Madison, Hamilton and other Americans.
      Within a week, four Departments of France had chosen him to represent
   them in the National Convention which was to devise a republican form of
   government for the French nation. He consented to represent the department
   of Pas-de-Calais. On Sept. 19, 1792  he began his work in Paris, taking
   his seat in the National Convention on September 21, 1792 and being
   appointed to a committee to draft a constitution for the republic on
   October 11. The constitution was drafted by this committee and ultimately
   adopted after many amendments on June 25,  1793.
      April 20, 1793, Paine wrote Thomas Jefferson "I begin to contemplate
   returning home. I shall await the event of the proposed Constitution, and
   then take my final leave of Europe."
      Late in December, 1793 Paine was expelled from the Convention and was
   put in prison around the first of January, 1794, where he remained for 10
   months.
       Gouveneur Morris, American Ambassador to France at the time of the
   Paine's imprisonment, apparently had a deep hatred and fear of Paine who
   allegedly knew too much about Morris' questionable status as a patriotic
   American. On January 21, 1794 Morris wrote Jefferson, then Secrerarv of
   State, regarding Paine's incarceration saying: I believe he thinks that I
   ought to claim him as an American citizen; but considering his birth, his
   naturalization in this country, and, the place he filled, I doubt much the
   right, and I am sure that the claim would be, for the present at least,
   inexpedient and ineffectual."
      Inasmuch as this line of reasoning was later adopted by the election
   inspector of New Rochelle, as a basis for denying Paine the right to vote,
   and thus gave rise to widespread erroneous impressions that Paine had lost
   his United States citizenship, Morris' letter requires careful analysis.
    
   Monroe secures Paine's release on grounds of his United States
   citizenship.
    
   Morris was removed as Ambassador to France in 1794 and James Monroe took
   his place. To Monroe, on September, 10, 1794, Paine wrote:
    
          "Those who propagate the report of my not being considered as
          a citizen of America by government, do it * * * without authority;
          for Congress, as a government, has neither decided upon it, nor yet
          taken the matter into consideration."
    
   This accurately states the fact in relation to any Act of Congress, at any
   time, dealing with Paine's citizenship despite statements occasionally
   found to the contrary. The records of
   the Department of State, now in The National Archives, at Washington, D.C.
   contain no information regarding Paine's citizenship to the time of his
   death, according to a letter from
   the Chief of the Division of State Department Archives dated August 21,
   1945.

      In the same Sept. 10, 1794 letter to Monroe, Paine wrote:

         "I have never abandoned America in thought, word or deed, and
         I feei it incumbent upon me to give this assurance to the friends I
         have in that country, and with whom I have always intended, and

         am determined, if the possibility exists, to close the scene of my

         life. It is there that I have made myself a home ***".

      In concluding his letter to Monroe, Paine wrote:

         "France does not claim me for a citizen; neither do I set up any
         claim of citizenship in France. The question is simply, whether
         I am or am not a citizen of America. I am imprisoned here on the
         decree for imprisoning Foreigners, because, say they, I was born in
         England. I say in answer, that, though born in England, I am not a
         subject of the British government any more than any other American
         is who was born, as they all were, under the same government, or
   that
         the citizens of France are subject of the French monarchy, under
   which
         they were born. I have twice taken the oath of abjuration to the
   British
         king and government, and of Allegiance to America. Once a citizen of
         the State of Pennsylvania in 1776; again before Congress,
   administered
         to me by the President, Mr. Hancock, when I was appointed Secretary
   in
         the office of foreign affairs in 1777."
    

   Monroe replied to Paine on September 18th (The Writings of James Monroe,
   1903, Vol. 7, p. 296) assuring Paine of his deepest interest and stating:

         "It becomes my duty, however, to declare to you, that I consider  
         you an American citizen, and that you are considered universally,
         In that character, by the people of America."
    
      On Nov.6, 1794, four days after Monroe filed his demand for release,
   Paine was set free and remained a guest of Monroe in Paris for some time,
   assisting Monroe in his work. Secretary of State Randolph, in his letter
   to Monroe of March 8, 1795 approves Monroe's action which secured Paine's
   release on the grounds of his American citizenship. When Monroe was
   recalled,  Paine was expected to return to America with him. Due to
   hostile activities of British men of war off France, (Paine was under
   threat of criminal prosecution by England for writing and publishing his
   Rights of Man, in 1792) he abandoned this plan and lived in Paris until
   1802 when he returned to this country. On March 18, 1801 President
   Jefferson wrote Paine offering him passage to America on the frigate
   Maryland but when Paine heard of criticism of Jefferson for offering him
   the aid of the American Navy, Paine declined the offer.
      He ultimately landed at Baltimore on October 30, 1802; lived in
   Washington, on friendly terms with Jefferson, and stayed in the Executive
   Mansion for several weeks. In February, 1803, he departed for New York.
   Paine took over his farm in New Rochelle, N. Y. in 1804, where,
   alternately living in New York City and in New Rochelle, he remained in
   New York State until his death in 1809.
    
   His right to vote challenged in 1806 on the grounds of lost citizenship.
    
      In 1806, Paine went to the polls in New Rochelle to vote and was
   refused a ballot by an inspector of elections, Elisha Ward.

      Paine's version of his disenfranchisement is contained in his letter to
   Vice-President Clinton dated May 4, 1807:

         "Respected Friend, - Elisha Ward and three or four other Tories
         who lived within the British lines in the revolutionary war, got to
         be inspectors of the election this year at New Rochelle. Ward was
         supervisor. These men refused my vote at the election, saying to
         me: `You are not an American; our Minister at Paris, Gouverneur
         Morris, would not reclaim you when you were imprisoned in the
         Luxembourg prison at Paris, and General Washington refused
         to do it."
    

      On the same day, he wrote his old friend Joel Barlow, who, as a private
   American citizen in Paris at the time of Paine's imprisonment had
   interceded for him:

         "I have prosecuted the Board of Inspectors for disfranchising me.
         You and other Americans in Paris went in a body to the Convention
         to reclaim me, and I want a certificate from you, properly

         attested, of this fact."

      In the notes of Madame Bonneville to whom he left most of his estate,
   she states:

         "This case was pleaded, before the Supreme Court of New York
         by Mr. Riker, then Attorney General, and, though Paine lost his
         cause, I as his legatee did not lose the having to pay for it."
    
      The papers in this prosecution were apparently not preserved. The trial
   or hearing should have taken place in White Plains, county seat of
   Westchester County in 1807. No record of the proceedings has been found at
   the County Clerk's office at White Plains, nor in New York City nor at
   Albany. In September, 1945, the Attorney-General's office in New York,
   searched its records and found that no Attorney General of the name of
   Riker ever held that office. It did find that one Richard Riker was
   District Attorney for the First District from 1801 to 1809. The First
   District then included New York and also Westchester County in which the
   Town of New Rochelle was located. It is a question whether Mr. Riker ever
   did more than give counsel to Paine in the preparation of affidavits and
   certificates secured for presentation to the New Rochelle Board of
   Elections. Even though a suit may have been brought in Supreme Court and
   decided adversely to Paine, the proceeditng in no way determined Paine's
   citizenship.
    
   The reasons ascribed for denying Paine his U. S. citizenship.
    
      In the many books, essays and monographs on the life of Paine, there
   appear as many different reasons assigned for Paine's alleged loss of
   citizenship as there are authors. Nevertheless, these various assignments
   all fit into 8 main classifications. These are as follows:
   (1) To his birth in England and his service as a British Civil Official.
   (2) To his return to England and sporadic residence there for brief
   periods of time after the Revolution.
   (3) To his residence in France from 1787 to 1802.
   (4) To the compliment conferred upon him by the Convention in 1793 which
   designated him as an honorary citizen of France.
   (5) To his service as a delegate from the Department of Calais in the
   French Convention in 1792 for the purpose of forming the constitution for
   post revolutionary France.
   (6) To an alleged act of Congress prompted by his bitter criticism of
   Washington for failing to secure his release from a French prison, which
   cancelled the U. S. citizenship previously conferred upon him.
   (7) To the act of the Election Inspector of the Town of New Rochelle, N.
   Y. in 1806 which denied him the right to vote.
   (8) To an alleged decision of the Supreme Court of the State of New York
   which adjudicated his status as not a citizen of the United States.
    
   Law
    
      Taking the assorted claims in the order of enumeration, we find:
    
   (1) Paine's birth and public service in England prior to 1774 in no
   respect affects his later acquired status as a citizen of the United
   States.
      Concededly Paine was a resident of the United States from1774 until
   after the Revolution, in active service of the American government. He
   twice took the oath of abjuration to the British crown and swore personal
   allegiance to the United States. In such circumstances the law is "clear
   as a ray of light."
      James Monroe (Diplomatic Dispatches, France, Vol. 4; Dispatch No. 5,
   Nov. 7, 1794 to the Secretary of State) accurately stated the legal
   principle involved as follows:
    
         "The case was different with Mr. Paine; he was actually a citizen
         of the United States, and of the United States only: for the
   revolution
         which parted us from Britain broke the allegiance which was before
         due to the crown of all those who took our side: he was of course
   not
         a British subject: nor was he strictly a citizen of France, for he
   came
         by invitation for the temporary purpose of assisting in the
   formation
         of their government only, and meant to withdraw to America when
         that should be completed; and what confirms this, is the act of the
         convention itself arresting him by which he is declared to be a
   foreigner."
    

      The United States Supreme Court in Inglis v. Sailor's Snug Harbour, 28
   U.S. 99, in the year 1830, handed down an exhaustive opinion of nearly one
   hundred pages which follows the rule set forth by Monroe. Much of the
   opinion is devoted to a precise definition of the citizenship status of
   British subjects resident in America during the Revolution. At page 159 of
   the Inglis opinion, it is said by Justice Story:

         "Under the peculiar circumstances of the revolution, the general,
         I do not say the universal, principle adopted, was, to consider all
         persons whether natives or inhabitants, upon the occurrence of the
         revolution, entitled to make their choice, either to remain subject
         of the British crown, or to become members of the United States."
    

   And at page 160:

         "Hence, the recognition on the part of Great Britain of our
         independence by the.treaty of 1783, has always been held by us
         as a complete renunciation on her part of any allegiance of the
         then members of the states, whether natives or British born. And
         the same doctrine has been in its fullest extent recognized in the
         British courts, in the case of Thomas v. Acklan, 2 Barn & cres.
   779."
    

      The separate opinion of Mr. Justice Thompson states at page 120:

         " ***It is universally admitted, both in the English courts and
         in those of our own country, that all persons born within the
         colonies of North America, whilst subject to the crown of Great
         Britain, were natural-born subjects and it must necessary follow
         that their character was changed by the separation of the colonies
         from the parent state, and the acknowledgement of their
   independence.
         The risk as to the point of time at which the American
         ante-nati ceased to be British subjects, differs in this country and
         in England, as established by the courts of justice in the
   respective
         countries. The English rule is, to take the date of the treaty

         of 1783; our rule is, to take the date of the declaration of
   independence.***"

      In Shanks v. DuPont, 28 U.S. 241, at 247, Mr. Justice Story said:

         "The treaty of peace of 1783 acted upon the state of things as it
         existed at that period. All those, whether natives or otherwise,
         who then adhered to the American states, were vestually absolved
         from all allegiance to the British crown; all those who then
         adhered to the British crown were deemed and held subjects of
         that crown."
    

      In Boyd v. Thayer, 143 U.S. 135, it is said at page 163:

         "All white persons or persons of European descent who were born
         in any of the colonies, or resided or who had been adopted there,
         before 1776, and had adhered to the cause of independence up
         to July 4, 1776, were by the declaration invested with the
         privileges of citizenship."
    

      There has been no deviation from the rule by the United States Supreme
   Court and the doctrine thus established is recognized and in force in New
   York. In 1839 the Supreme Court of Judicature of the State of New York, in
   Young v. Peck, 21 Wendell's Reports 389, passed upon the citizenship of
   one James Knox, a manborn in Scotland who came to this country in 1774,
   leaving a daughter in Scotland. Knox remained in this country until his
   death. The court found that he was a citizen of the United States and so
   too was his daughter altho she did not come to America until 1830. At
   pages 390, 391, the opinion of Chief Justice Nelson says:

         "The father of the plaintiff arrived here before the declaration
         of independence and adhered to this country; he was an original
         citizen, and is to be considered the same as native born."
    

      The authoritative text book, Kent's Commentaries, Vol. 2, Lecture XXV
   entitled "On The Rights of Aliens and Natives", sums up the well
   established principle of law on the subject at page 88:

         "Natives are all persons born within the jurisdiction of the United
         States, If they were resident citizens at the time of the
   declaration
         of independence, though born elsewhere, and deliberately yielded
         to it an express or implied sanction, they became parties to it, and
         are to be considered as natives; their social tie being coeval with
         the existence of the nation."
    
      With both facts and law equally well established Paine's birth and
   public service in England before 1774 in no way affect his legal status as
   "an original citizen" of the United States by reason of his residence here
   at the time of the declaration of independence and the peace treaty of
   1783, plus his several oaths of abjuration of the British crown and of
   allegiance to the United States which, in addition to his well known
   patriotic services are clear personal evidence of his election and intent
   to become a United States citizen.
    
   (2) Paine's sporadic and brief visits to England in the years 1787 to 1792
   changed neither his true American domicile nor his status as a citizen of
   the United States.
    
      There is not the slightest intimation that any of Paine's visits to
   England between 1787 and 1792 resulted in his taking up a fixed or
   permanent domicile there with intent to sever his American citizenship and
   take back his old status an English subject. His writings are all to the
   contrary and expressly set forth his intent to return to the land he
   thought of as his home. (Letters of March 31, 1787 (Franklin); Sept.15,
   1789 (Jefferson); May 5, 1790 (Washington); April 20, 1793 (Jefferson);
   Sept. 10, 1794 ( Monroe).

      In Paine's appeal to the Convention for release from imprisonment,
   dated August7 , 1794, he made his position clear:

         "Citizens, when I left the United States in the year 1787, I
   promised
         to all my friends that I would return to them the next year; but the
         hope of seeing a revolution happily established in France, that
   might
         serve as a model to the rest of Europe, and  the earnest and
   disinterested
         desire of rendering every service in my power to promote it, induced
   me
         to defer my return to that country, and to the society of my
   friends, for
         more than seven years."
    
      The object of Paine's visits to England were twofold; to see his aged
   mother and to promote his bridge business. Nothing whatsoever appears even
   indicating a change of domicile or residence, much less of citizenship.

      Controlling law on this point is well set forth by the Court of Appeals
   of New York in the case of Duprey v. Wurtz, 53 N.Y. 556 at p. 561:

         "To effect a change of domicile * * * there must be not only a
         change of residence, but an intention to abandon the former
         domicile. There must be both residence in the alleged adopted
        domicile and intention to adopt such place of residence as the
         sole domicile. Residence alone has no effect per se, though it may
         be most important, as a ground from which to infer intention.
         Length of residence will not alone effect the change. Intention
         alone will not do it, but the two taken together do constitute a
         change of domicile."
    

      In People v. Platt, 50 Hun 454, the law is exhaustively set forth, in
   order to determine a claimed right to vote. At page 475 the rule both in
   this country and England is clearly stated:

         "Domicile of choicer" said Lord Westbury, in the case of Udny v.
         Udny (L.R., 1 Scotch and Div. App. Cases,458), is a conclusion or
         inference which the law derives from the fact of a man fixing
         voluntarily his sole or chief residence in a particular place with
         an intention of continuing to reside there for an unlimited. time.
         This is a description of the circumstances which create or
   constitute
         a domicile, and not a definition of the term. There must
         be a residence freely chosen, and not prescribed or dictated by
         any external necessity, such as the duties of office, the demands
         of creditors, or the relief from illness; and it must be residence
         fixed not for a limited period or particular purpose, but general
         and indefinite in its future contemplation.,, The authorities
         above cited, as well as many others, are in accord with this
   description.
         The idea is of a home residence, kept in fact and intent,
         with the view to permanency, though business, pleasure, health
         or constraint may lead to the occupation of a temporary and long
         continuing residence elsewhere."
    
      By none of the accepted tests applied to the facts of Paine's sporadic
   visits to England, purely for temporary purposes without any intention of
   establishing continued residence there, do those visits affect his United
   States citizenship.
    
   (3) Paine's residence in France from 1787 to 1803 to promote his bridge,
   to aid in forming the new constitution and to assist Ambassador Monroe,
   was without intent to change either his domicile or citizenship and did
   not do so.
    
      For sixteen years following 1787, Paine spent most of his time in
   France. The purpose of his original visit was made evident by the letter
   of introduction he secured from Franklin to members of the French Academy
   of Science. He wished to secure the Academy's approval of his bridge
   design. He thought he could do this and "return next winter". [Letter to
   Franklin of March 31, 1787, Appeal to Convention, Aug. 7, 1794); his
   activities relating to the bridge and his frequent expressions of intent
   to return to America, mentioned before, negative any settled purpose to
   make F.rance his permanent place of abode, or to sever his allegiance to
   the United States.
      His continued assistance to Ambassador Monroe in Paris after his
   release from jail, does not alter the situation any more the than
   residence abroad, today, of any U.S. citizen in the diplomatic or consular
   service of this country, would affect such a person's citizenship.
      The Dupuy v. Wurtz opinion(53 N.Y. 556 at 561) expressly states that
   "Length of residence will not alone effect the change". In Paine's case,
   by both his acts and expressed intentions, he showed that he never meant
   to abandon his United States home or citizenship or, change his permanent
   place of abode to France.

      Referring again to the accepted authority, Kent, the same volume and
   lecture before referred to, state's at page 97:

         "So, an American citizen may obtain a foreign domicile, which
          will impress upon a natural character for commercial purposes,
          in like manner as if he were a subject of the government under
         which he resided; and yet without losing on that account his
         original character or ceasing to be bound by the allegiance due to
         the country of his birth."
         (U. S. v. Gillies, 1 Peters C.C. Rep. 1;59 Murray v. The Schooner
         Charming Betsey, 2 Cranch 64)
    
      For the reasons above stated and the authorities cited under item (2),
   it is clear that Paine's mere residence in France after 1787 in no way
   affected his United States Citizenship, there being no special statutes
   such as are in existence today, affecting such long continued residence.
    
   (4) The complimentary title of French citizen was a mere ceremonial
   gesture with no force or effect upon Paine's true citizenship.
    
      Little time need be spent on this item. The identical compliment
   conferred on Paine was simultaneously conferred on many outstanding
   Americans including Washington, Madison
   and Hamilton. It has never occurred to anyone to question the citizenship
   of the last named by reason of the identical compliment.
      In recent times our General Eisenhower was made a citizen of Belfast,
   Ireland, in honor of his exploits. We, in our turn, expected to confer
   honorary citizenship upon Zukkov on his visit here. Will anyone say, by
   such gestures, that Eisenhower became an Irishman and Zhukov an American?
      It is of some interest to recall that the Marquis De Lafayette on his
   last visit to the United States in 1825, was honored with perpetual
   American citizenship for both himself and his descendants. This
   distinction is unique in our history and gives any of his male descendants
   the right of entry into our country as citizens of the United States and
   to vote in our elections.

      It doesn't in one iota alter Lafayette's true status as a citizen of
   France. Oddly enough, Paine, in his memorial to James Monroe on Sept. 10,
   1794, in which he said he had never abandoned his citizenship of America
   for that of France, also revealed the inspirations also of the
   complimentary titles.

         "The idea of conferring honorary citizenship upon foreigners
         * * * was first proposed by me to Lafayette, at the commencement
         of the French Revolution * * * ".
    
      The title, so conferred, is an empty one so far as its effect upon true
   citizenship is concerned.
    
   (5) His service as a delegate in the French Convention for the purpose of
   framing the new French Constitution worked no change in his U.S.
   citizenship.
    

      In Paine's letter to Washington, dated July 30, 1796, he sets forth
   clearly both his personal intentions and material facts relating to his
   service as a delegate in the French Convention.

         "I have always considered that a foreigner, such as I was in fact,
         with respect to France, might be a member of a convention for
         framing a constitution, with out affecting his right of citizenship
         in the country to which he belongs, but not a member of a
         government after a constitution is formed; and I have uniformly
         acted upon this distinction. * * *
         No oath of allegiance or of citizenship was required of the members
         who composed the convention; there was nothing existing in form
         to swear allegiance to.  If any such condition had been required,
         I could not, as a citizen of America in fact, though a citizen of
         France by compliment, have accepted a seat in the Convention."
    
      Paine's own arguments seem so sound as to require no further
   elaboration. The significance of his statement that no oath of allegiance
   of a citizen was required by members of the Convention is a determining
   point. In addition to all of the above, there is a point of law involved
   which controls this situation, for regardless of whether or not Paine
   desired to sever his U. S. citizenship he had no legal right to do so
   without the express consent of the U. S. Government under the controlling
   law of that period. From the records of the National Archives, it is
   established that no such consent was ever given by the U. S. Government.

      In Inglis v. Sailor's Snug Harbor, 28 U.S. 99, Judge Story points out:

         "The general principle of the common law also is, that the
   allegiance
         thus due by birth cannot be dissolved by any act of the subject.
         It remains perpetual, unless it is dissolved by consent of the
         sovereign, or by separation of law." * * * "The cases are plain
         enough upon the doctrines of law, as well as upon those which
         are recognized in the law of Nicene."
    
      After stating the above principle, the court agrees that in the case of
   a natural-born British subject, who moved to the United States before the
   Revolution, the Peace Treaty of 1783 between England and America expressly
   provided that the allegiance due England was dissolved by the war and the
   Peace Treaty conferred upon a British subject the right to take his U. S.
   Citizenship.

      Again referring to Kent's Commentaries, volume II lecture XXV, it is
   there stated at Pages 91 to 96:

         "It is the doctrine of the English law, that natural-born subjects
         owe an allegiance, which is intensive and perpetual, and which
         cannot be diverted by any act of their own. (Story's case, Dyer's
         Rep. 298, b, 300b. 1 Blacks. Com. 370, 371. 1 Hale's P.C. 68.
         Foster's Crown Law 7, 5, 9, 183.). They held, that it was not in
         the power of any private subject to shake off his allegiance
         and transfer it to a foreign prince; nor was it in the power of any
         foreign prince, by naturalization or employing a subject of Great
         Britain, to dissolve the bond of allegiance between that subject
         and the crown. (Fosters Crown Law 59)"
         "In the case of Talbot v. Janson (3 Dallas 133) the doctrine was
         brought before the Supreme Court of the United States. * * *
         'Though a person may become naturalized abroad, yet if he has
         not been legally discharged of his allegiance at home, it will
         remain notwithstanding the party may have placed himself in
         difficulty, by double and conflicting claims of allegiance."
         "The majority of the Supreme Court gave no opinion upon the
         question; but the inference, from the discussion, would seem to
         be, that a citizen could not divest himself of his allegiance,
   except
         under the sanction of a law of the United States; and that until
         some legislative regulations on the subject were presented, the
         rule of the common law must prevail."
         " In 1797, the same question was brought before the circuit court
         of the United States for the district of Connecticut, in the case of
         Isaac Williams (cited in 2 Cranch.82, note) and Ch. J. Ellsworth
         rules, that the common raw of this country remained as it was
         before the revolution. The compact between the community and its
         members was, that the community should protect its members, and
         that the members should at all times be obedient to the laws of the
         community , and faithful to its defense. No member could dissolve
         the compact without the consent or default on the part of the
         United States.
         "The question came before the U. S. Supreme Court next in 1822  in
         The Santissima Trinidad case, but again was left undetermined.
         "From this historical review of the principal discussions in the
   federal
         courts on this interesting subject in American jurisprudence, the
   better
         opinion would seem to be, that a citizen cannot renounce his
   allegiance
         to the United States without the permission of goyernment, to be
   .declared
         by law; and. that, as there is no existing legislative regulation on
   the case,
         the rule of the English common law remains unaltered."
         "This rule was admitted in Inglis v. The Trustees of the Sailor's
   Snug
         Harbour, 3 Peters 99 and expressly declared in Shanks v. Dupont,
   ibid.242
    

      The true and controlling  rule existing at the time in question is most
   clearly given by Judge Story in Shanks v. DuPont, 28 U.S. 241, 245 in the
   following language:

         "The general doctrine is, that no person can, by any act of their
   own,
         without the consent of the Government, put off their allegiance and
         become aliens".
    
      The trip to Europe in 1787 was not the first time Paine left America
   after he arrived had in 1774. White serving as clerk to the Pennsylvania
   Assembly, in February 1781, accompanied by Colonel Laurens to France a
   vital mission to the Colonies, for the purpose of securing desperately
   needed hard cash to carry on the war. By June of 1781, the mission
   succeeded and Paine and Lauren sailed for home on a French frigate loaded
   with 2,500,000 levres in silver, and a shipload of sorely needed clothing
   and munitions for the army. This trip has never occasioned any claim that
   it caused any change in his citizenship; yet despite the greatly increased
   duration of his stay in 1787-1802, the trips were of identical effect in
   the eyes of the law, so far as his citizenship is concerned.
      All the known facts of Paine's services in the French Revolution, which
   he declared were inspired by his desire to further promote the interests
   of the United States in securing a protective freedom, comparable to that
   secured by the colonists (and always bearing in mind that at no time did
   Paine indicate any desire to permanently settle in France, but on the
   contrary, constantly reiterated his intention of returning to his home in
   the United States), and his services in the Convention, did not and could
   not under the law then prevailing, in any way alter his United States
   citizenship.
    
   (6) There is no act of Congress forfeiting Paine's citizenship.
    
      The expression sometimes can be found that Paine was deprived of his
   rights of U. S. citizenship by act of Congress in retaliation for the
   bitter letter which Paine wrote Washington after his release from prison
   criticizing Washington for his failure to actively intercede in his
   behalf. Such an act would be a matter of public record for all of the acts
   of Congress have been carefully preserved. The National Archives have been
   searched specifically for any data regarding Paine's citizenship in so far
   as any act of Congress is concerned. There is none of record.
    
   (7) The challenge by the Inspector of Elections in New Rochelle on the
   ground that Morris had failed to claim him as a citizen of the United
   States, was false in fact and without legal basis.
    
      Paine states that his vote was denied on Ward's statement: "You are not
   an American; our Minister at Paris, Gouverneur Morris, would not reclaim
   you when you were imprisoned in the Luxembourg prison at Paris, and
   General Washington refused to do it."

      The fact is that Morris, regardless of lack of sympathy toward Paine or
   the lukewarm representations government to the French he made, did in fact
   claim Paine as a citizen of the United States. In Diplomatic Dispatches,
   France, volume 3 (Dispatch No. 45, March 6, 1794, Gouverneur Morris to
   Secretary of State Jefferson) Morris expressly reported:

         * * * "Mr. Paine wrote me a note desiring I would claim him as an
   American, which I accordingly did, tho contrary to my Judgment for the
   Reasons mentioned in my last. "

   The above quoted document also appears in American State Papers, Foreign
   Relations, Vol. 1, page 404:

         "The following is a copy of the translation of the letter from the
         Minister of Foreign Affairs of France to Gouvrneur Morris,
         mentioned in the extract taken from dispatch no. 45. This copy
         is recorded in Diplomatic Despatches, France volume 3-B,
         Duplicates, pages 59-60;
   `Paris l. Ventose 2d year of the Republic one and indivisible
         'The Minister for foreign affairs to the Minister plenipotentiary
         from the United States to the Republic of France.
        'By your letter of the 26 of last month, you claim the liberty of
         Thomas Paine, as an American citizen. A native of England, this
         ex deputy has become successively an American and French citizen.
         By accepting this last title, and filling a place in the Legislative
         body, he submitted himself to the laws of the Republic, and he
         has thereby renounced the protection which the law of nations
         and treaties concluded with the United States might have given him.
         'I am ignorant of the motives of his detention, but I should presume
         that they are well founded. I shall nevertheless submit your demand
         to the Committee of Public Safety and instantly make known to you
         its decision.
               
                                                                                Deforgues."
    

      Paine himself in his letter to Vice-President Clinton of May 4, 1807
   while preparing to prosecute Ward, says:

         "As to Gouverneur Morris, the case is that he did reclaim me;
          but his reclamation did me no good, and the probability is, he
         did not intend it should * * *. I shall supoena Morris, and if I
         get attested copies from the Secretary of State's office it will
         prove the lie on the inspectors."
    
   He further asked Clinton for an attested copy of Secretary of State
   Randolph's dispatch to Ambassador Monroe, approving Monroe's successful
   reclamation of Paine as a citizen of the United States, in which dispatch
   Randolph said: "The President approves what you have done in the case of
   Mr. Paine."

      Monroe, writing to Paine on September I8, 1794 (The Writings of James
   Monroe, Vol. 7, p. 296-7):

          "Of the sense which the President has always entertained of
          your merits, and of his friendly dispositions towards you,  you
          are too well assured, to require any declaration of it from me.
          That I forward his wishes in seeking your safety, is what I well
          know; and this will form an additional obligation on me, to
          perform what I should otherwise consider my duty."
    
      Wrong on the facts and wrong in acting as he did in depriving Paine of
   his vote in any case, in the eyes of the law, this entire incident is
   wholly without merit so far as affecting Paine's citizenship is concerned.
    
   (8) There is no court record in which Paine's citizenship was adjudicated.
    
      Despite several letters written by Paine which state that he was
   prosecuting the Election Inspectors for denying him his vote, replies to
   those letters and the statement by Mrs. Bonneville that the suit was
   pleaded, lost, and she paid court costs, no public record of this action
   can be found, either in New York City or Westchester County, where it
   naturally would have been tried.
     Mrs. Bonneville refers to Paine's attorney in this action as a Mr.
   Riker, Attorney General of the State. The Attorney General's office,
   however, definitely establishes that New York never had an Attorney
   General of that name. The same office does state that a Richard Riker is
   listed in the Civil List as having been District Attorney for the First
   District (which included New York and Westchester Counties from 1801 to
   1809). The Westchester County Court of Oyer and Terminer records list
   Riker's name as District Attorney prosecuting in that court in 1806-7.
      Paine's own letter to Clinton of May 4, 1807 speaks of Mr. Riker as
   District Attorney and this is undoubtedly the correct title. Conway, in
   his Life of Paine, Vol. 2, p. 383, mentions his interview with John H.
   Riker, a son of Paine's counsel, who searched his father's records for any
   data on the case and found none, perhaps because of a fire which destroyed
   many of those papers.
      While the forum was stated to be the Supreme Court of the State of New
   York, no Supreme Court record of the case can be found, although such
   records were preserved for years before 1806-7. A court record of Paine's
   criminal prosecution of a New Rochellean, who shot at him, prior to 1806,
   is fully preserved at the county seat of Westchester County.
      And while Paine's letters, devoted to his preparation for the trial,
   specify that the letters he seeks are for use before judge and jury, there
   is reasonable ground for believing that his proceeding was a motion only,
   which would be heard by a judge without a jury. No record of such a
   hearing would be preserved in the usual course of court reporting.
     The requests of Paine to Clinton, Madison and Joel Barlow, to furnish
   him with letters for his use on the prosecution of Ward would indicate
   that the actual proceeding was a motion, based on documentary evidence,
   rather than a jury trial with witnesses and cross examinations.
      Any quantity of reasons would have caused Paine to lose his motion,
   including technical defects in legal pleading, remote from the merits in
   issue. Even if a jury trial did occur, that, too, may well have been
   dismissed by the presiding judge, without submission to the jury, on
   technicalities unrelated to the merits.
      The later fate was, indeed, forecast by Vice President Clinton when he
   wrote Paine on May 12, 1807 saying he had written the letter Paine wished
   for the trial and sent it directly to Attorney Riker. Clinton then
   expressed doubt as to the admissability of such letters in evidence on the
   trial. From every known rule of evidence prevailing then and now, such
   letters (which Paine indicated would constitute his case) would not be
   admitted in evidence. The reason is abundantly clear. The writers of those
   letters were alive at the time of trial. In order to give fair opportunity
   to the opposition to test the truth or accuracy of the statements in the
   letters, in simple fairness, the writers should have first been sworn to
   tell the truth, then testify to matters of which they actually had
   personal knowledge, and then submit to all the tests which the
   cross-examining lawyer has at his command to break down such testimony.
   Such has always been the strict rule in our courts and it properly
   prevails today.
      Accordingly, if Paine's attorney tried to present his case merely on
   letters and affidavits, the presiding judge quite rightfully may have
   excluded them from evidence and dismissed Paine's complaint, without
   passing on its merits, for failure to present proper proof. This action
   would not be a judicial determination that Paine was wrong in his
   contentions, or Ward right. The merits of the issue simply would not
   receive judicial consideration, much less determination. The
   decision would constitute no precedent or court ruling on Paine's
   citizenship.
      In the absence of any official court record the situation remains as
   tho no court proceeding ever were brought and the facts and legal
   principles given in the enumerated items above are fully determinative.
    
   Conclusion
    
      From all established facts and law applicable thereto, Paine became a
   citizen of the United States at the time of the Declaration of
   Independence  and retained that citizenship to the date of his death.
