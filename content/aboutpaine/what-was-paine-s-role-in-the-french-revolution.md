   Paine played a similar role in the French Revolution to that in the
   American Revolution. His *Common Sense* was translated into French and was
   widely read, which greatly spurred on the forces against monarchy and for
   democracy. He wrote *Rights of Man* in defense of the French Revolution
   against the attacks of England, and he was greeted in France as a hero and
   elected to the Assembly. There he took a leading role in writing the
   French Constitution and fought for universal suffrage. But he lost that
   fight, was sentenced to death, and barely escaped execution. *Rights of
   Man* became the vehicle which spread the ideals of the
   French Revolution around the world. Many of his most significant and impactful works were done in France in the 1790s.
