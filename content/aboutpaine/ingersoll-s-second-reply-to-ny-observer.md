   PEORIA, Nov. 2d, 1877.

   To the Editor of the New York Observer:

   You ought to have honesty enough to admit that you did, in your paper of
   July 19th, offer to prove that the absurd story that Thomas Paine died in
   terror and agony on account of the religious opinions he had expressed,
   was true. You ought to have fairness enough to admit that you called upon
   me to deposit one thousand dollars with an honest man, that you might, by
   proving that Thomas Paine did die in terror, obtain the money.

   You ought to have honor enough to admit that you challenged me and that
   you commenced the controversy concerning Thomas Paine.

   You ought to have goodness enough to admit that you were mistaken in the
   charges you made.

   You ought to have manhood enough to do what you falsely asserted that
   Thomas Paine did: -- you ought to recant. You ought to admit publicly that
   you slandered the dead; that you falsified history; that you defamed the
   defenseless; that you deliberately denied what you had published in your
   own paper. There is an old saying to the effect that open confession is
   good for the soul. To you is presented a splendid opportunity of testing
   the truth of this saying.

   Nothing has astonished me more than your lack of common honesty exhibited
   in this controversy. In your last, you quote from Dr. J.W. Francis. Why
   did you leave out that portion in which Dr. Francis says that Cheetham
   with settled malignity wrote the life of Paine? Why did you leave out that
   part in which Dr. Francis says that Cheetham in the same way slandered
   Alexander Hamilton and DeWitt Clinton? Is it your business to suppress the
   truth? Why did you not publish the entire letter of Bishop Fenwick? Was it
   because it proved beyond all cavil that Thomas Paine did not recant? Was
   it because in the light of that letter Mary Roscoe, Mary Hinsdale and
   Grant Thorburn appeared unworthy of belief? Dr. J.W. Francis says in the
   same article from which you quoted, "Paine clung to his Infidelity until
   the last moment of his life." Why did you not publish that? It was the
   first line immediately above what you did quote. You must have seen it.
   Why did you suppress it? A lawyer, doing a thing of this character, is
   denominated a shyster. I do not know the appropriate word to designate a
   theologian guilty of such an act.

   You brought forward three witnesses, pretending to have personal knowledge
   about the life and death of Thomas Paine: Grant Thorburn, Mary Roscoe and
   Mary Hinsdale. In my reply I took the ground that Mary Roscoe and Mary
   Hinsdale must have been the same person. I thought it impossible that
   Paine should have had a conversation with Mary Roscoe, and then one
   precisely like it with Mary Hinsdale. Acting upon this conviction, I
   proceeded to show that the conversation never could have happened, that it
   was absurdly false to say that Paine asked the opinion of a girl as to his
   works who had never read but little of them. I then showed by the
   testimony of William Cobbett, that he visited Mary Hinsdale in 1819,
   taking with him a statement concerning the recantation of Paine, given him
   by Mr. Collins, and that upon being shown this statement she said that "it
   was so long ago that she could not speak positively to any part of the
   matter -- that she would not say any part of the paper was true." At that
   time she knew nothing, and remembered nothing. I also showed that she was
   a kind of standing witness to prove that others recanted. Willett Hicks
   denounced her as unworthy of belief.

   To-day the following from the New York World was received, showing that I
   was right in my conjecture:

                             TOM PAINE'S DEATH BED.

   To the Editor of the World:

   SIR: I see by your paper that Bob Ingersoll discredits Mary Hinsdale's
   story of the scenes which occurred at the death-bed of Thomas Paine. No
   one who knew that good lady would for one moment doubt her veracity or
   question her testimony. Both she and her husband were Quaker preachers,
   and well known and respected inhabitants of New York City. Ingersoll is
   right in his conjecture that Mary Roscoe and Mary Hinsdale was the same
   person. Her maiden name was Roscoe, and she married Henry Hinsdale. My
   mother was a Roscoe, a niece of Mary Roscoe, and lived with her for some
   time. I have heard her relate the story of Tom Paine's dying remorse, as
   told her by her aunt, who was a witness to it. She says (in a letter I
   have just received from her), "he (Tom Paine) suffered fearfully from
   remorse, and renounced his Infidel principles, calling on God to forgive
   him, and wishing his pamphlets and books to be burned, saying he could not
   die in peace until it was done."

   (REV.) A.W. CORNELL.   

   Harpersville, New York.

   You will notice that the testimony of Mary Hinsdale has been drawing
   interest since 1809, and has materially increased. If Paine "suffered
   fearfully from remorse, renounced his Infidel opinions and called on God
   to forgive him," it is hardly generous for the Christian world to fasten
   the fangs of malice in the flesh of his reputation.

   So Mary Roscoe was Mary Hinsdale, and as Mary Hinsdale has been shown by
   her own admission to Mr. Cobbett to have known nothing of the matter; and
   as Mary Hinsdale was not, according to Willet Hicks, worthy of belief --
   as she told a falsehood of the same kind about Mary Lockwood, and was,
   according to Mr. Collins, addicted to the use of opium -- this disposes of
   her and her testimony.

   There remains upon the stand Grant Thorburn. Concerning this witness, I
   received, yesterday, from the eminent biographer and essayist, James
   Parton, the following episode:

   NEWBURYPORT, MASS.

   Col. R.G. Ingersoll:

   Touching Grant Thorburn, I personally know him to have been a dishonest
   man. At the age of ninety-two he copied, with trembling hand, a piece from
   a newspaper and brought it to the office of the Home Journal, as his own.
   It was I who received it and detected the deliberate forgery. If you are
   ever going to continue this subject, I will give you the exact facts.

                                Fervently yours,

                                               JAMES PARTON.  

   After this, you are welcome to what remains of Grant Thorburn.

   There is one thing that I have noticed during this controversy regarding
   Thomas Paine. In no instance that I now call to mind has any Christian
   writer spoken respectfully of Mr. Paine. All have taken particular pains
   to call him "Tom" Paine. Is it not a little strange that religion should
   make men so coarse and ill-mannered?

   I have often wondered what these same gentlemen would say if I should
   speak of the men eminent in the annals of Christianity in the same way.
   What would they say if I should write about "Tim" Dwight, old "Ad" Clark,
   "Tom" Scott, "Jim" McKnight, "Bill" Hamilton, "Dick" Whately, "Bill"
   Paley, and "Jack" Calvin?

   They would say of me then, Just what I think of them now.
   Even if we have religion, do not let us try to get along without good
   manners. Rudeness is exceedingly unbecoming, even in a saint. Persons who
   forgive their enemies ought, to say the least, to treat with politeness
   those who have never injured them.

   It is exceedingly gratifying to me that I have compelled you to say that
   "Paine died a blaspheming Infidel." Hereafter it is to be hoped nothing
   will be heard about his having recanted. As an answer to such slander his
   friends can confidently quote the following from the New York Observer of
   November 1st, 1877:

   "WE HAVE NEVER STATED IN ANY FORM, NOR HAVE WE EVER SUPPOSED THAT PAINE
   ACTUALLY RENOUNCED HIS INFIDELITY. THE ACCOUNTS AGREE IN STATING THAT HE
   DIED A BLASPHEMING INFIDEL."

   This for all coming time will refute the slanders of the churches yet to
   be.

   Right here allow me to ask: If you never supposed that Paine renounced his
   Infidelity, why did you try to prove by Mary Hinsdale that which you
   believed to be untrue?

   From the bottom of my heart I thank myself for having compelled you to
   admit that Thomas Paine did not recant.

   For the purpose of verifying your own admission concerning the death of
   Mr. Paine, permit me to call your attention to the following affidavit:

                          WABASH, INDIANA, October 27, 1877.  

   Col. R.G. Ingersoll:

   DEAR SIR: The following statement of facts is at your disposal. In the
   year 1833 Willet Hicks made a visit to Indiana and stayed over night at my
   father's house, four miles east of Richmond. In the morning at breakfast
   my mother asked Willet Hicks the following questions:

   "Was thee with Thomas Paine during his last sickness?"

   Mr. Hicks said: "I was with him every day during the latter part of his
   last sickness."

   "Did he express any regret in regard to writing the 'Age of Reason,' as
   the published accounts say he did -- those accounts that have the credit
   of emanating from his Catholic housekeeper?"

   Mr. Hicks replied: "He did not in any way by word or action."

   "Did he call on God or Jesus Christ, asking either of them to forgive his
   sins, or did he curse them or either of them?"

   Mr. Hicks answered: "He did not. He died as easy as any one I ever saw
   die, and I have seen many die in my time."

                                          WILLIAM B. BARNES. 

            Subscribed and sworn to before me Oct. 27, 1877.

                               WARREN BIGLER, Notary Public.

   You say in your last that "Thomas Paine was abandoned of God." So far as
   this controversy is concerned, it seems to me that in that sentence you
   have most graphically described your own condition.

   Wishing you success in all honest undertakings, I remain,

                                  Yours truly.

                                                       ROBERT G. INGERSOLL.

                          The Observer's Second Attack
                          
                     From the N.Y. Observer of Nov. 1, 1877

                                TOM PAINE AGAIN

   In the Observer of September 27th, in response to numerous calls from
   different parts of the country for information, and in fulfillment of a
   promise, we presented a mass of testimony, chiefly from persons with whom
   we had been personally acquainted, establishing the truth of our
   assertions in regard to the dissolute life and miserable end of Paine. It
   was not a pleasing subject for discussion, and an apology, or at least an
   explanation, is due to our readers for resuming it, and for occupying so
   much space, or any space, in exhibiting the truth and the proofs in regard
   to the character of a man who had become so debased by his intemperance,
   and so vile in his habits, as to be excluded, for many years before and up
   to the time of his death, from all decent society.

   Our reasons for taking up the subject at all, and for presenting at this
   time so much additional testimony in regard to the facts of the case, are
   these: At different periods for the last fifty years, efforts have been
   made by Infidels to revive and honor the memory of one whose friends would
   honor him most by suffering his name to sink into oblivion, if that were
   possible. About two years since, Rev. O. B. Frothingham, of this city,
   came to their aid, and undertook a sort of championship of Paine, making
   in a public discourse this statement: "No private character has been more
   foully calumniated in the name of God than that of Thomas Paine." (Mr.
   Frothingham, it will be remembered, is the one who recently, in a public
   discourse, announced the downfall of Christianity, although he very kindly
   made the allowance that, "it may be a thousand years before its decay will
   be visible to all eyes." It is our private opinion that it will be at
   least a thousand and one.) Rev. John W. Chadwick, a minister of the same
   order of unbelief, who signs himself, "Minister of the Second Unitarian
   Society in Brooklyn," has devoted two discourses to the same end,
   eulogizing Paine. In one of these, which we have before us in a handsomely
   printed pamphlet, entitled, "Method and Value of his (Paine's) Religious
   Teachings," he says: "Christian usage has determined that an Infidel means
   one who does not believe in Christianity as a supernatural religion; in
   the Bible as a supernatural book; in Jesus as a supernatural person. And
   in this sense Paine was an Infidel, and so, thank God, am I." It is proper
   to add that Unitarians generally decline all responsibility for the
   utterances of both of these men, and that they compose a denomination, or
   rather two denominations, of their own.

   There is also a certain class of Infidels who are not quite prepared to
   meet the odium that attaches to the name; they call themselves Christians,
   but their sympathies are all with the enemies of Christianity, and they
   are not always able to conceal it. They have not the courage of their
   opinions, like Mr. Frothingham and Mr. Chadwick, and they work only
   sideways toward the same end. We have been no little amused since our last
   article on this subject appeared, to read some of the articles that have
   been written on the other side, though professedly on no side, and to
   observe how sincerely these men deprecate the discussion of the character
   of Paine, as an unprofitable topic. It never appeared to them unprofitable
   when the discussion was on the other side.

   Then, too, we have for months past been receiving letters from different
   parts of the country, asking authentic information on the subject and
   stating that the followers of Paine are making extraordinary efforts to
   circulate his writings against the Christian religion and in order to give
   currency to these writings they are endeavoring to rescue his name from
   the disgrace into which it sank during the latter years of his life. Paine
   spent several of his last years in furnishing a commentary upon his
   Infidel principles. This commentary was contained in his besotted,
   degraded life and miserable end, but his friends do not wish the
   commentary to go out in connection with his writings. They prefer to have
   them read without the comments by their author. Hence this anxiety to free
   the great apostle of Infidelity from the obloquy which his life brought
   upon his name; to represent him as a pure, noble, virtuous man, and to
   make it appear that he died a peaceful, happy death, just like a
   philosopher.

   But what makes the publication of the facts in the case still more
   imperative at this time is the wholesale accusation brought against the
   Christian public by the friends and admirers of Paine. Christian ministers
   as a class, and Christian journals are expressly accused of falsifying
   history, of defaming "the mighty dead!" (meaning Paine,) &c., &c. In the
   face of all these accusations it cannot be out of place to state the facts
   and to fortify the statement by satisfactory evidence, as we are
   abundantly able to do.

   The two points on which we proposed to produce the testimony are, the
   character of Paine's life (referring of course to his last residence in
   this country, for no one has intimated that he had sunk into such besotted
   drunkenness until about the time of his return to the United States in
   1802), and the real character of his death as consistent with such a life,
   and as marked further by the cowardliness, which has been often exhibited
   by Infidels in the same circumstances.

   It is nothing at all to the purpose to show, as his friends are fond of
   doing, that Paine rendered important service to the cause of American
   Independence. This is not the point under discussion and is not denied. No
   one ever called in question the valuable service that Benedict Arnold
   rendered to the country in the early part of the Revolutionary war; but
   this, with true Americans, does not suffice to cast a shade of loveliness
   or even to spread a mantle of charity over his subsequent career. Whatever
   share Paine had in the personal friendship of the fathers of the
   Revolution he forfeited by his subsequent life of beastly drunkenness and
   degradation, and on this account as well as on account of his blasphemy he
   was shunned by all decent people.

   We wish to make one or two corrections of misstatements by Paine's
   advocates, on which a vast amount of argument has been simply wasted. We
   have never stated in any form, nor have we ever supposed, that Paine
   actually renounced his Infidelity. The accounts agree in stating that he
   died a blaspheming Infidel, and his horrible death we regard as one of the
   fruits, the fitting complement of his Infidelity. We have never seen
   anything that encouraged the hope that he was not abandoned of God in his
   last hours. But we have no doubt, on the other hand, that having become a
   wreck in body and mind through his intemperance, abandoned of God,
   deserted by his Infidel companions, and dependent upon Christian charity
   for the attentions he received, miserable beyond description in his
   condition, and seeing nothing to hope for in the future, he was afraid to
   die, and was ready to call upon God and upon Christ for mercy, and ready
   perhaps in the next minute to blaspheme. This is what we referred to in
   speaking of Paine's death as cowardly. It is shown in the testimony we
   have produced, and still more fully in that which we now present. The most
   wicked men are ready to call upon God in seasons of great peril, and
   sometimes ask for Christian ministrations when in extreme illness; but
   they are often ready on any alleviation of distress to turn to their
   wickedness again, in the expressive language of Scripture, "as the sow
   that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."

   We have never stated or intimated, nor, so far as we are aware, has any
   one of our correspondents stated, that Paine died in poverty. It has been
   frequently and truthfully stated that Paine was dependent on Christian
   charity for the attentions he received in his last days, and so he was.
   His Infidel companions forsook him and Christian hearts and hands
   ministered to his wants, notwithstanding the blasphemies of his death-bed.

   Nor has one of our correspondents stated, as alleged, that Paine died at
   New Rochelle. The Rev. Dr. Wickham, who was a resident of that place
   nearly fifty years ago, and who was perfectly familiar with the facts of
   his life, wrote that Paine spent "his latter days" on the farm presented
   to him by the State of New York, which was strictly true, but made no
   reference to it as the place of his death.

   Such misrepresentations serve to show how much the advocates of Paine
   admire "truth."

   With these explanations we produce further evidence in regard to the
   manner of Paine's life and the character of his death, both of which we
   have already characterized in appropriate terms, as the following
   testimony will show.

   In regard to Paine's "personal habits," even before his return to this
   country, and particularly his aversion to soap and water, Elkana Watson, a
   gentleman of the highest social position, who resided in France during a
   part of the Revolutionary war, and who was the personal friend of
   Washington, Franklin, and other patriots of the period, makes some
   incidental statements in his "Men and Times of the Revolution." Though
   eulogizing Paine's efforts in behalf of American Independence, he
   describes him as "coarse and uncouth in his manners, loathsome in his
   appearance, and a disgusting egotist." On Paine's arrival at Nantes, the
   Mayor and other distinguished citizens called upon him to pay their
   respects to the American patriot. Mr. Watson says: "He was soon rid of his
   respectable visitors, who left the room with marks of astonishment and
   disgust." Mr. W., after much entreaty, and only by promising him a bundle
   of newspapers to read while undergoing the operation, succeeded in
   prevailing on Paine to "stew, for an hour, in a hot bath." Mr. W.
   accompanied Paine to the bath, and "instructed the keeper, in French,
   (which Paine did not understand,) gradually to increase the heat of the
   water until 'le Monsieur serait bien bouille' (until the gentleman shall
   be well boiled;) and adds that "he became so much absorbed in his reading
   that he was nearly parboiled before leaving the bath, much to his
   improvement and my satisfaction."

   William Carver has been cited as a witness in behalf of Paine, and
   particularly as to his "personal habits." In a letter to Paine, dated
   December 2, 1776, he bears the following testimony:

   "A respectable gentleman from New Rochelle called to see me a few days
   back, and said that everybody was tired of you there, and no one would
   undertake to board and lodge you. I thought this was the case, as I found
   you at a tavern in a most miserable situation. You appeared as if you had
   not been shaved for a fortnight, and as to a shirt, it could not be said
   that you had one on. It was only the remains of one, and this, likewise,
   appeared not to have been off your back for a fortnight, and was nearly
   the color of tanned leather; and you had the most disagreeable smell
   possible; just like that of our poor beggars in England. Do you remember
   the pains I took to clean you? that I got a tub of warm water and soap and
   washed you from head to foot, and this I had to do three times before I
   could get you clean." (And then follow more disgusting details.)

   "You say, also, that you found your own liquors during the time you
   boarded with me; but you should have said, 'I found only a small part of
   the liquor I drank during my stay with you; this part I purchased of John
   Fellows, which was a demijohn of brandy containing four gallons, and this
   did not serve me three weeks.' This can be proved, and I mean not to say
   anything that I cannot prove; for I hold truth as a precious jewel. It is
   a well-known fact, that you drank one quart of brandy per day, at my
   expense, during the different times that you have boarded with me, the
   demijohn above mentioned excepted, and the last fourteen weeks you were
   sick. Is not this a supply of liquor for dinner and supper?"

   This chosen witness in behalf of Paine, closes his letter, which is full
   of loathsome descriptions of Paine's manner of life, as follows:

   "Now, sir, I think I have drawn a complete portrait of your character; yet
   to enter upon every minutiae would be to give a history of your life, and
   to develop the fallacious mask of hypocrisy and deception under which you
   have acted in your political as well as moral capacity of life."

   (Signed)      "WILLIAM CARVER."           

   Carver had the same opinion of Paine to his dying day. When an old man,
   and an Infidel of the Paine type and habits, he was visited by the Rev.
   E.F. Hatfield, D.D., of this city, who writes to us of his interview with
   Carver, under date of Sept. 27, 1877:

   "I conversed with him nearly an hour, I took special pains to learn from
   him all that I could about Paine, whose landlord he had been for eighteen
   months. He spoke of him as a base and shameless drunkard, utterly
   destitute of moral principle. His denunciations of the man were perfectly
   fearful, and fully confirmed, in my apprehension, all that had been
   written of Paine's immorality and repulsiveness."

   Cheetham's Life of Paine, which was published the year that he died, and
   which has passed through several editions (we have three of them now
   before us) describes a man lost to all moral sensibility and to all sense
   of decency, a habitual drunkard, and it is simply incredible that a book
   should have appeared so soon after the death of its subject and should
   have been so frequently republished without being at once refuted, if the
   testimony were not substantially true. Many years later, when it was found
   necessary to bolster up the reputation of Paine, Cheetham's Memoirs were
   called a pack of lies. If only one-tenth part of what he publishes
   circumstantially in his volume, as facts in regard to Paine, were true,
   all that has been written against him in later years does not begin to set
   forth the degraded character of the man's life. And with all that has been
   written on the subject we see no good reason to doubt the substantial
   accuracy of Cheetham's portrait of the man whom he knew so well.

   Dr. J.W. Francis. well-known as an eminent physician, of this city, in his
   Reminiscences of New York, says of Paine:

   "He who, in his early days, had been associated with, and had received
   counsel from Franklin, was, in his old age, deserted by the humblest
   menial; he, whose pen has proved a very sword among nations, had shaken
   empires, and made kings tremble, now yielded up the mastery to the most
   treacherous of tyrants, King Alcohol"

   The physician who attended Paine during his last illness was Dr. James R.
   Manley, a gentleman of the highest character. A letter of his, written in
   October of the year that Paine died, fully corroborates the account of his
   state as recorded by Stephen Grellet in his Memoirs, which we have already
   printed. He writes:

   "New York, October 2, 1809: I was called upon by accident to visit Mr.
   Paine, on the 25th of February last, and found him indisposed with fever,
   and very apprehensive of an attack of apoplexy, as he stated that he had
   that disease before, and at this time felt a great degree of vertigo, and
   was unable to help himself as he had hitherto done, on account of an
   intense pain above the eyes. On inquiry of the attendants I was told that
   three or four days previously he had concluded to dispense with his usual
   quantity of accustomed stimulus and that he had on that day resumed it. To
   the want of his usual drink they attributed his illness, and it is highly
   probable that the usual quantity operating upon a state of system more
   excited from the above privations, was the cause of the symptoms of which
   he then complained.... And here let me be permitted to observe (lest blame
   might attach to those whose business it was to pay any particular
   attention to his cleanliness of person) that it was absolutely impossible
   to effect that purpose. Cleanliness appeared to make no part of his
   comfort; he seemed to have a singular aversion to soap and water; he would
   never ask to be washed, and when he was he would always make objections;
   and it was not unusual to wash and to dress him clean very much against
   his inclinations. In this deplorable state, with confirmed dropsy,
   attended with frequent cough, vomiting and hiccough, he continued growing
   from bad to worse till the morning of the 8th of June, when he died.
   Though I may remark that during the last three weeks of his life his
   situation was such that his decease was confidently expected every day,
   his ulcers having assumed a gangrenous appearance, being excessively
   fetid, and discolored blisters having taken place on the soles of his feet
   without any ostensible cause, which baffled the usual attempts to arrest
   their progress; and when we consider his former habits, his advanced age,
   the feebleness of his constitution, his constant habit of using ardent
   spirits ad libitum till the commencement of his last illness, so far from
   wondering that he died so soon, we are constrained to ask, How did he live
   so long? Concerning his conduct during his disease I have not much to
   remark, though the little I have may be somewhat interesting. Mr. Paine
   professed to be above the fear of death, and a great part of his
   conversation was principally directed to give the impression that he was
   perfectly willing to leave this world, and yet some parts of his conduct
   were with difficulty reconcilable with his belief. In the first stages of
   his illness he was satisfied to be left alone during the day, but he
   required some person to be with him at night, urging as his reason that he
   was afraid that he should die when unattended, and at this period his
   deportment and his principle seemed to be consistent; so much so that a
   stranger would judge from some of the remarks he would make that he was an
   Infidel. I recollect being with him at night, watching; he was very
   apprehensive of a speedy dissolution, and suffered great distress of body,
   and perhaps of mind (for he was waiting the event of an application to the
   Society of Friends for permission that his corpse might be deposited in
   their grave-ground, and had reason to believe that the request might be
   refused), when he remarked in these words, 'I think I can say what they
   made Jesus Christ to say -- "My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me?
   "He went on to observe on the want of that respect which he conceived he
   merited, when I observed to him that I thought his corpse should be matter
   of least concern to him; that those whom he would leave behind him would
   see that he was properly interred, and, further, that it would be of
   little consequence to me where I was deposited provided I was buried; upon
   which he answered that he had nothing else to talk about, and that he
   would as lief talk of his death as of anything, but that he was not so
   indifferent about his corpse as I appeared to be.

   "During the latter part of his life, though his conversation was
   equivocal, his conduct was singular; he could not be left alone night or
   day; he not only required to have some person with him, but he must see
   that he or she was there, and would not allow his curtain to be closed at
   any time; and if, as it would sometimes unavoidably happen, he was left
   alone, he would scream and halloo until some person came to him. When
   relief from pain would admit, he seemed thoughtful and contemplative, his
   eyes being generally closed, and his hands folded upon his breast,
   although he never slept without the assistance of an anodyne. There was
   something remarkable in his conduct about this period (which comprises
   about two weeks immediately preceding his death), particularly when we
   reflect that Thomas Paine was the author of the 'Age of Reason.' He would
   call out during his paroxysms of distress, without intermission, 'O Lord
   help me! God help me! Jesus Christ help me! Lord help me! ' etc.,
   repeating the same expressions without the least variation, in a tone of
   voice that would alarm the house. It was this conduct which induced me to
   think that he had abandoned his former opinions, and I was more inclined
   to that belief when I understood from his nurse (who is a very serious
   and, I believe, pious woman), that he would occasionally inquire, when he
   saw her engaged with a book, what she was reading, and, being answered,
   and at the same time asked whether she should read aloud, he assented, and
   would appear to give particular attention.

   "I took occasion during the nights of the fifth and sixth of June to test
   the strength of his opinions respecting revelation. I purposely made him a
   very late visit; it was a time which seemed to suit exactly with my
   errand; it was midnight, he was in great distress, constantly exclaiming
   in the words above mentioned, when, after a considerable preface, I
   addressed him in the following manner, the nurse being present: 'Mr.
   Paine, your opinions, by a large portion of the community, have been
   treated with deference, you have never been in the habit of mixing in your
   conversation words of coarse meaning; you have never indulged in the
   practice of profane swearing; you must be sensible that we are acquainted
   with your religious opinions as they are given to the world. What must we
   think of your present conduct? Why do you call upon Jesus Christ to help
   you? Do you believe that he can help you? Do you believe in the divinity
   of Jesus Christ? Come, now, answer me honestly. I want an answer from the
   lips of a dying man, for I verily believe that you will not live
   twenty-four hours.' I waited some time at the end of every question; he
   did not answer, but ceased to exclaim in the above manner. Again I
   addressed him; 'Mr. Paine, you have not answered my questions; will you
   answer them? Allow me to ask again, do you believe? or let me qualify the
   question, do you wish to believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?'
   After a pause of some minutes, he answered, 'I have no wish to believe on
   that subject.' I then left him, and knew not whether he afterward spoke to
   any person on any subject, though he lived, as I before observed, till the
   morning of the 8th. Such conduct, under usual circumstances, I conceive
   absolutely unaccountable, though, with diffidence, I would remark, not so
   much so in the present instance; for though the first necessary and
   general result of conviction be a sincere wish to atone for evil
   committed, yet it may be a question worthy of able consideration whether
   excessive pride of opinion, consummate vanity, and inordinate self-love
   might not prevent or retard that otherwise natural consequence. For my own
   part, I believe that had not Thomas Paine been such a distinguished
   Infidel he would have left less equivocal evidences of a change of
   opinion. Concerning the persons who visited Mr. Paine in his distress as
   his personal friends, I heard very little, though I may observe that their
   number was small, and of that number there were not wanting those who
   endeavored to support him in his deistical opinions, and to encourage him
   to 'die like a man,' to 'hold fast his integrity,' lest Christians, or, as
   they were pleased to term them, hypocrites, might take advantage of his
   weakness, and furnish themselves with a weapon by which they might hope to
   destroy their glorious system of morals. Numbers visited him from motives
   of benevolence and Christian charity, endeavoring to effect a change of
   mind in respect to his religious sentiments. The labor of such was
   apparently lost, and they pretty generally received such treatment from
   him as none but good men would risk a second time, though some of those
   persons called frequently."

   The following testimony will be new to most of our readers. It is from a
   letter written by Bishop Fenwick (Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston),
   containing a full account of a visit which he paid to Paine in his last
   illness. It was printed in the United States Catholic Magazine for 1846;
   in the Catholic Herald of Philadelphia, October 15, 1846; in a supplement
   to the Hartford Courant, October 23, 1847; and in Littell's Living Age for
   January 22, 1848, from which we copy. Bishop Fenwick writes:

   "A short time before Paine died I was sent for by him. He was prompted to
   this by a poor Catholic woman who went to see him in his sickness, and who
   told him, among other things, that in his wretched condition if anybody
   could do him any good it would be a Roman Catholic priest. This woman was
   an American convert (formerly a Shaking Quakeress) whom I had received
   into the church but a few weeks before. She was the bearer of this message
   to me from Paine. I stated this circumstance to F. Kohlmann, at breakfast,
   and requested him to accompany me. After some solicitation on my part he
   agreed to do so, at which I was greatly rejoiced, because I was at the
   time quite young and inexperienced in the ministry, and was glad to have
   his assistance, as I knew, from the great reputation of Paine, that I
   should have to do with one of the most impious as well as infamous of men.
   We shortly after set out for the house at Greenwich where Paine lodged,
   and on the way agreed on a mode of proceeding with him.

   "We arrived at the house; a decent-looking elderly woman (probably his
   housekeeper,) came to the door and inquired whether we were the Catholic
   priests, for said she, 'Mr. Paine has been so much annoyed of late by
   other denominations calling upon him that he has left express orders with
   me to admit no one to-day but the clergymen of the Catholic Church. Upon
   assuring her that we were Catholic clergymen she opened the door and
   showed us into the parlor. She then left the room and shortly after
   returned to inform us that Paine was asleep, and, at the same time,
   expressed a wish that we would not disturb him, 'for,' said she, 'he is
   always in a bad humor when roused out of his sleep. It is better we wait a
   little till he be awake.' We accordingly sat down and resolved to await a
   more favorable moment. 'Gentlemen,' said the lady, after having taken her
   seat also, 'I really wish you may succeed with Mr. Paine, for he is
   laboring under great distress of mind ever since he was informed by his
   physicians that he cannot possibly live and must die shortly. He sent for
   you to-day because he was told that if any one could do him good you
   might. Possibly he may think you know of some remedy which his physicians
   are ignorant of. He is truly to be pitied. His cries when he is left alone
   are heart-rending. 'O Lord help me! 'he will exclaim during his paroxysms
   of distress -- 'God help me -- Jesus Christ help me!' repeating the same
   expressions without the least variation, in a tone of voice that would
   alarm the house. Sometimes he will say, 'O God, what have I done to suffer
   so much! 'then, shortly after, 'But there is no God,' and again a little
   after, 'Yet if there should be, what would become of me hereafter.' Thus
   he will continue for some time, when on a sudden he will scream, as if in
   terror and agony, and call out for me by name. On one of these occasions,
   which are very frequent, I went to him and inquired what he wanted. 'Stay
   with me,' he replied, 'for God's sake, for I cannot hear to be left
   alone.' I then observed that I could not always be with him, as I had much
   to attend to in the house. 'Then,' said he, 'send even a child to stay
   with me, for it is a hell to be alone.' 'I never saw,' she concluded, 'a
   more unhappy, a more forsaken man. It seems he cannot reconcile himself to
   die.'

   "Such was the conversation of the woman who had received us, and who
   probably had been employed to nurse and take care of him during his
   illness. She was a Protestant, yet seemed very desirous that we should
   afford him some relief in his state of abandonment, bordering on complete
   despair. Having remained thus some time in the parlor, we at length heard
   a noise in the adjoining passage-way, which induced us to believe that Mr.
   Paine, who was sick in that room, had awoke. We accordingly proposed to
   proceed thither, which was assented to by the woman, and she opened the
   door for us. On entering, we found him just getting out of his slumber. A
   more wretched being in appearance I never beheld. He was lying in a bed
   sufficiently decent of itself, but at present besmeared with filth; his
   look was that of a man greatly tortured in mind; his eyes haggard, his
   countenance forbidding, and his whole appearance that of one whose better
   days had been one continued scene of debauch. His only nourishment at this
   time, as we were informed, was nothing more than milk punch, in which he
   indulged to the full extent of his weak state. He had partaken,
   undoubtedly, but very recently of it, as the sides and corners of his
   mouth exhibited very unequivocal traces of it, as well as of blood, which
   had also followed in the track and left its mark on the pillow. His face,
   to a certain extent, had also been besmeared with it."

   Immediately upon their making known the object of their visit, Paine
   interrupted the speaker by saying: "That's enough, sir; that's enough,"
   and again interrupting him, "I see what you would be about. I wish to hear
   no more from you, sir. My mind is made up on that subject. I look upon the
   whole of the Christian scheme to be a tissue of absurdities and lies, and
   Jesus Christ to be nothing more than a cunning knave and impostor." He
   drove them out of the room, exclaiming: "Away with you and your God, too;
   leave the room instantly; all that you have uttered are lies -- filthy
   lies; and if I had a little more time I would prove it, as I did about
   your impostor, Jesus Christ."

   This, we think, will suffice. We have a mass of letters containing
   statements confirmatory of what we have published in regard to the life
   and death of Paine, but nothing more can be required.
