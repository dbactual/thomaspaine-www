   Paine was trained at an early age to follow his father's trade as a
   staymaker.  The first biography of Paine by Oldys (who was paid by
   English monarchists) characterized Paine as "corset-maker" to
   deride him. This is one of the many slanders spread to this day to
   discredit him. Paine trained as a teenager to be a staymaker but
   spent most of his early youth as a privateer.
