   Paine was trained at an early age to follow his father's trade as a
   staymaker. Thetford, England, the town where he grew up, was a
   shipbuilding center because of its timber. Staymakers lived there to sew
   the sails. The first biography of Paine by Oldys (who was paid by English
   monarchists) characterized this as "corset-making" to deride Paine. This
   is one of the many slanders spread to this day to discredit him.
