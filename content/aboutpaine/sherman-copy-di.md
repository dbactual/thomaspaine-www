A manuscript copy of an early version of the Declaration of Independence has emerged that appears to offer
additional insight into the creation and evolution of one of our nation's Charters of Freedom. We can refer
to this document as the Sherman copy, since it was used to inform Roger Sherman of the draft status of the Declaration during the fourth week of June, 1776.

While the discovery of this manuscript is exciting to scholars of early American history as a tangible
artifact used during the creation of the Declaration, its significance extends beyond as it offers clues
to our understanding of the creation of the Declaration of Independence in June, 1776.
It offers unique insight into the drafting process, evidenced by editing within the
manuscript via the purposeful over-scripting of lowercase characters with uppercase letters.
Interestingly, this working Declaration manuscript also contains an inscription that potentially demonstrates Thomas Paine's direct influence and involvement in its drafting process. The notion of Thomas Paine's involvement in the drafting of the Declaration is not a newly formulated
hypothesis; rather, historians and scholars have debated the possibility of his direct involvement for the
better portion of the last two centuries. Multiple authors have written on the subject, including Moody (1872),
Van der Weyde (1911), Lewis (1947), and more recently, Smith & Rickards (2007).<a href="#footnotes">(1)<a>   Despite these previous
efforts in establishing Paine's connection to, or involvement in the Declaration text, no tangible evidence has
emerged to potentially corroborate these conclusions - until now.

While current scholarly analysis of the works of Thomas Paine continue to establish Paine's enduring mark on
the origins of the American Revolution (see Berton, Petrovic, Schiaffino & Ivanov's monumental examination of
the Thomas Paine corpus - Iona College), Paine's unique perspective and influence were largely overshadowed in
the two centuries after Paine's death.<a href="#footnotes">(2)</a> Thomas Edison, former Vice-President of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, remarked in his essay entitled "The Philosophy of
Thomas Paine" how he considered Paine our greatest political thinker, and elaborated on Paine's influence and
close relationships with the inner circle of Congressional members who comprised the Committee
to frame the Declaration:

<blockquote>"Although the present generation knows little of Paine's writings, and although he has almost no influence
upon contemporary thought, Americans of the future will justly appraise his work. I am certain of it. Truth is
governed by natural laws and cannot be denied. Paine spoke truth with a peculiarly clear and forceful ring.
Therefore, time must balance the scales. The Declaration and the Constitution expressed in form Paine's theory
of political rights. He worked in Philadelphia at the time that the first document was written, and occupied a
position of intimate contact with the nation's leaders when they framed the Constitution." - *Thomas Edison,
1925*<a href="#footnotes">(3)</a></blockquote>

For scholars and historians to discuss the historical significance of this
document and its vantage point into Paine's potential role in the drafting
the Declaration, it was imperative to demonstrate its authenticity beyond reasonable doubt, prior to amending
the historical account of our nation's independence. The intention of including
our comprehensive analysis of the Sherman copy was to provide a
foundation upon which the necessary discussion of Thomas Paine's rightful place in American history, and the evolution of the text of
the Declaration of Independence, could proceed.

The original manuscript draft of the Declaration of Independence, a draft which Julian Boyd refers to as the
one from which Jefferson made his *rough draft*, is what scholars of the Declaration presume lost.<a href="#footnotes">(4)</a> An additional fragment of a working draft in
Jefferson's hand predates his rough draft, held by the Library of Congress, has survived, demonstrating
that the Jefferson rough draft was one of several working drafts used during June 11 - June
28, 1776. Two complete manuscript copies of the original draft of the Declaration of Independence exist:
the known John Adams copy, a fair copy because of its neat penmanship and organization, held by the
Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston, and the Jefferson rough draft in the Library of
Congress collection, which demonstrates the numerous edits made by the Committee of Five selected to draft the Declaration.

This newly discovered, partial manuscript draft appears to have been made for Benjamin Franklin, then passed
onto Roger Sherman, fellow member of the Committee of Five. This leaves only Robert R.
Livingston's copy, if a separate copy was made for his review, to follow the trail of communications of the Committee of Five. 

As the Declaration Resources Project at Harvard rightfully acknowledged through its monumental Declaration
Database, it was essential to distinguish these three drafts, and the partial Jefferson draft at the LOC, as
working manuscripts; different in intention and form from the later handwritten copies Jefferson sent to
Richard H. Lee and others. These later copies reflected the revisions made throughout the manuscript drafts with edits by
Jefferson, Adams & Franklin.

The Sherman Copy of the Declaration is unique, as its inscription (verso) appears to demonstrate a position
of authority for "T.P.", as copying the "original" Declaration draft necessitated permission, or at a minimum,
respect in such a request. It behooves scholars of early American history to address the significance of this
note, and contemplate whether such permission would be necessitated if "T.P." did not hold
a position of significance with the Committee that drafted the Declaration.

"*A beginning perhaps - Original with Jefferson - Copied from Original with T.P.'s permission*". Is it possible,
though, that the "T.P." initials referenced an individual other than Thomas Paine? For this reason, under the
direction of Professor Danielle Allen, colleagues at the Declaration Resources Project of Harvard University
graciously conducted a comprehensive search of individuals of political influence present in Philadelphia
during the summer of 1776, and concluded that the T.P. initials within the context of the Sherman manuscript
appear to belong to Thomas Paine. Professor Allen and Emily
Sneff, Associate Fellow of Harvard's Declaration Resources Project, investigated individuals affiliated with
Thomas Jefferson, including household members, between the years of 1776-1784 before reaching this conclusion.<a href="#footnotes">(5)</a>
While the potential for the T.P. initials to reference an individual other than Paine should be acknowledged,
the contextual understanding of who was intimately aware, and would have been privy to, the Declaration
drafting process appeared to strongly favor Thomas Paine. Professor Allen graciously acknowledged her
support of this manuscript and its significance by agreeing to include it in the register of Harvard's
Declaration Database during its next update.

The Sherman Copy manuscript was the first page of an early working draft of the Declaration of Independence,
which was discovered folded within the pages of an estate auction booklet of General Hugh Lowrey White, a
Brigadier General in the War of 1812. The estate auction booklet and Declaration draft manuscript were located
within a box of discarded papers by an amateur historian in Georgia. The manuscript was brought to the
attention of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association (TPNHA) to better understand its historical
context and significance. This author, Professor Gary Berton, and scholars from the TPNHA, conducted a thorough
analysis of the manuscript to validate its authenticity and more comprehensively understand the events and
participants surrounding the creation of the Declaration of Independence.

In order to establish provenance, a thorough genealogy was completed, which established chain of
possession from General Hugh Lowrey White back to Colonel Alexander Lowrey, a significant political member and
signer of the Pennsylvania Constitution in 1776.

General White was a Brigadier General during the War of 1812 who went on to establish a very profitable salt
works in Kentucky. General White descended from Colonel Alexander Lowrey (b. 1726 - d. 1805), the prominent
Pennsylvanian (Lancaster County) delegate during the Declaration of Independence and Pennsylvania Constitution
deliberations. Gen. Hugh Lowrey White was the son of William White and Ann Marie (Lowrey) White. His mother,
Ann Marie, was born in Lancaster, PA in 1750, daughter of Joseph Lowrey (b.1727- d.1785); Joseph Lowrey was
the brother of Colonel Alexander Lowrey, a well-known Trader and ardent supporter of independence, from
Donegal, Pennsylvania.<a href="#footnotes">(6)</a>

Colonel Alexander Lowrey was appointed to the Committee of Correspondence for Lancaster County in 1775, and
appointed to the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1775, serving until 1789. He attended the Provincial Conference of
Committees of the Province of Pennsylvania held at Carpenter's Hall from June 18 - June 25, 1776. Colonel
Lowrey served as an elected delegate at the conference alongside fellow Lancaster County delegate George Ross
- Vice President of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention and Benjamin Franklin, Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention President. On June 18, 1776, before the Convention was held, Colonel Lowrey assisted at the Provincial
Conference in the initial framing of the Pennsylvania Constitution, election of members for the Constitutional
Convention, and officially signed the Pennsylvania Constitution as a Lancaster County delegate. Colonel Lowrey's
involvement in the Provincial Conference was quite significant, as the proceedings of this conference helped
make possible the Declaration of Independence. Colonel Lowrey later served with distinction in multiple battles
during the Revolution.<a href="#footnotes">(7)</a>

The preceding family lineage placed Gen. Hugh Lowrey White's grand-uncle, Colonel Alexander Lowrey, in Carpenter's Hall, on June 24, 1776 (the date on the manuscript), during active discussion of the Declaration of Independence.
Coincidentally, on this same day, *A Declaration of Independence of the Deputies of Pennsylvania* is read during the
meeting of the Provincial Conference, and signed by Thomas McKean,
Provincial Conference President; Colonel Alexander Lowrey was in attendance and present for this momentous
occasion.<a href="#footnotes">(8)</a>

Colonel Lowrey continued to have extensive involvement in the revolutionary events immediately following the
Declaration of Independence as a delegate in the Constitutional Convention of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania held
at Philadelphia from July 15-September 28, 1776.<a href="#footnotes">(9)</a> Through this historical account we can understand how
Colonel Alexander Lowrey had strong relationships with Benjamin Franklin and fellow Congressional leaders, and
direct contact with the Committee of Five members in Philadelphia during June - September, 1776. Colonel Lowery's
possession of this manuscript draft may allow us to infer that other members had direct or indirect
influence on the drafting of the Declaration of Independence.

This early manuscript draft was entitled "A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America
in general Congress assembled" with inscription at lower left (recto) of "June 24, 1776 /R. Sherman's Copy/page 1".
Two sets of initials were written (verso) along with an inscription by the hand of the transcription's writer. The initials
"R.S." are located in the upper right-hand corner; the inscription "*A beginning perhaps - / Original with
Jefferson - / Copied from Original / with T. P.'s permission*" and the initials "B.F." are situated in the
center of page. The document measures approximately 14 inches by 8 3/8 inches (foolscap folio size) and was
written in black (fading to brown) ink on early, period rag paper.

The Estate Auction Booklet, dated August 15, 1856, was written in black ink on light blue lined paper with the
mill maker's mark of Owen & Hurlbut, South Lee, Massachusetts embossed on the top, left corner (recto). The
paper mill of Owen & Hurlbut was in operation from 1822-1860. The auction book measures 12 3/8 inches by 7 7/8
inches.

The Massachusetts Historical Society confirmed that the known Adams copy has been in its collection since
it was donated directly by the Adams family in the early 1900's. The Adams copy was privately held by the Adams
family prior to possession by the Massachusetts Historical Society, during which time no facsimile copies were
produced.<a href="#footnotes">(10)</a> The first public appearance of the known Adams copy (and the production of its first facsimile copy) was
in 1943 during the Library of Congress' display of the Jefferson Papers, as noted in Julian P. Boyd's
*Declaration of Independence: Evolution of the Text* (1945). Due to the inaccessibility of the Adams fair copy,
our research team reasonably concluded this manuscript was created shortly before the Adams fair copy during
June 11-28, 1776, and before the Committee of Five presented its finalized draft to Congress for
debate and approval.

While Sherman's review and approval of this initial draft was evident through his initials (verso), who copied
this draft from the "original with Jefferson"? At first glance, the identification of the writer was not evident, which warranted an extensive forensic handwriting comparison to identify
its penman. Analysis included stylistic examination of distinctive characteristics and comparative
evaluation of all 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence, in addition to acting secretaries and scribes
relevant to this historical event and time period. Analysis was conducted utilizing enhanced scale imaging and
topical overlay to examine characteristics, including those attributed to muscle memory, unique to each
candidate. The results of this analysis led to the identification of John Adams as the likely writer of this early
Declaration manuscript.

In order to successfully evaluate and accurately attribute handwriting, an examination of multiple characteristics was conducted that collectively identified the writer. Each characteristic, such as writing movement, pressure,
form (i.e. simplified or embellished), connectivity, and alignment (baseline, line direction, organization) is
unique to each individual and consequently creates a comprehensive assessment when used as an analytic device.
In the analysis of this document's text, the following characteristics were evaluated: form (*print/cursive*),
connectivity, space, margins (*margin respect*), alignment (*baseline alignment*), and capitals. A unique quality
of this early Declaration of Independence draft is the haste in which it was taken.<a href="#footnotes">(11)</a> While this undoubtedly
affected writing slant, the characteristics described above remained intact.

Blue Ink underlay; newly discovered manuscript in Black Ink overlay]**

This Declaration manuscript (in black ink overlay) demonstrated multiple characteristics unique to individual
handwriting that are indicative of both documents being written by the same writer.
Most significant were the unique components of writing that are the result of muscle memory: first, the *negative space* between words in the following excerpts:

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-3.png"></center>

Second, the distinct upward direction in which the writer's hand led, or *baseline alignment*, in the
following excerpts:

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-4.png"></center>

As the writer of the inscription (verso) was not immediately evident, an additional handwriting
analysis was conducted using the methods described in the identification of the transcription writer.
Multiple handwriting features, including baseline alignment, negative space, and character formation matched features identified in the transcription. This allowed our research team to  conclude that writer of the inscription was also John Adams.

Examination of the penmanship showed that the characters were written in Eighteenth Century
British-American handwriting. The style of handwritten lettering used throughout the manuscript was
Snell Roundhand, developed by Charles Snell, an English writing master who wrote *The Penman's Treasury Open'd*
in 1694. This detail should be considered noteworthy when compared to more contemporary handwriting styles such as Spencerian Script, which was
implemented in the United States from approximately 1850 to 1925, and the Palmer Method of
penmanship developed by Austin Palmer in the late nineteenth and early twentiethth centuries.
Historical evidence demonstrates how the Snell Roundhand is period-correct, which was
replaced by Spencerian Script around 1850 after the publication of *Spencer and Rice's System of Business and
Ladies' Penmanship* in 1848.<a href="#footnotes">(12)</a> This manuscript's handwriting style supported a pre-1850 creation through the writer's
demonstrated fluency in Snell Roundhand penmanship.<a href="#footnotes">(13)</a>

The handwriting analysis referenced earlier noted this draft was not created by Roger Sherman.
Rather, this manuscript was seemingly made for Sherman and other Committee members for review.
Historically, we know that Sherman and other Committee of Five members participated in various Congressional
committees simultaneously, and that Sherman's involvement with the
Declaration did not appear in the record until a preliminary draft was completed. Sherman and Adams were
the only members of the Committee of Five that were also selected for the Board of War and Ordinances on
June 12, 1776; Sherman's involvement on the Committee of War could have precluded him from more active
involvement in the Declaration's initial committee deliberations, thus necessitating the creation of this
manuscript. <a href="#footnotes">(14)</a> The inscription (verso), "A beginning perhaps - Original with Jefferson..." appeared to support
the timeframe in which this would have happened, as well as the early draft state of the text.
  
Sherman's initials on the upper right corner (verso) indicated that he received, reviewed, approved this draft,
and signed off on it, procedurally. The date of June 24, 1776 (recto) potentially indicated the date on which
Sherman received the draft. Sherman's initials and approval of the
manuscript allowed us to understand how and why it left his possession, potentially forwarded to fellow
Committee of Five member Robert R. Livingston, or significant others. Confirmation of the "R.S." initials on this manuscript written by Roger Sherman was conducted utilizing Sherman's "R" and "S" initials from the engrossed copy of the Declaration of Independence, a period reference. Comparison via light board overlay, demonstrated an excellent match (approximately 95% with 5% attributed to natural variation).

When this manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence was examined for the first time in person, it
was evident that it was written on early, hand-made wove paper. A common presumption of scholars and historical
document collectors noted that wove paper was only available to the Colonies after the Revolution; this
misconception may have garnered acknowledgement without considering the limited references of past paper
historians, and the current technological advances that now allow for more thorough investigation into wove paper's
origins. Online digitalization of manuscripts, books, and countless historical documents within the past five
years alone has provided us with greater access to early examples of wove paper, and its presence in the Colonies during the American Revolution.

The earliest wove paper this research team uncovered dated back to the late 1750s. Through his authoritative
text *Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft*, Dard Hunter educated us on the origins of
wove paper; he noted the first wove produced in England occurred by 1757, used in John Baskerville's special
edition of *Virgil* (for which wove paper moulds were made by James Whatman the Elder). Hunter reminded us,
though, that wove paper had been created and used in the Orient for many years prior.<a href="#footnotes">(15)</a> Wove paper was eventually
preferred and considered a superior paper to laid in the latter portion of the 18th century because of its
smooth surface and increased density. However, following its use in Europe in the late 1750s, few
wire mould makers were skilled in creating wove's more complex wire moulds. In the American colonies, wove
paper appeared accessible to printers in Philadelphia as early as 1773, primarily through the mould
and paper maker Nathan Sellers of nearby Willcox Mill at Ivy Mills, Chester, Pennsylvania. Sellers kept
exquisitely detailed journals, currently located in the collection of the American Philosophical Society, in
which he noted orders of imported "woven" wire to make wove paper moulds in 1773.<a href="#footnotes">(16)</a> Nathan Sellers was of a select
few skilled wire mould makers to make wove paper moulds in Pennsylvania at that
time, and became the primary mould maker for many of the colonial paper mills throughout the Revolution. Interestingly, Benjamin Franklin possessed and
used wove paper during the Revolution, and introduced wove paper to France around 1777.<a href="#footnotes">(17)</a>
  
Imported paper became increasingly scarce at this time, which necessitated Colonial paper mills to
maximize production. Benjamin Franklin was largely responsible for the massive efforts in rag collection used
in paper making in Philadelphia, and Nathan Sellers was even recalled from serving in the Army to return to
wire mould making during the Revolution.<a href="#footnotes">(18)</a> A partial watermark was discovered in the upper, left
margin (recto) of the manuscript which, when first analyzed through light board illumination, proved difficult
to discern. Further investigation into this watermark is warranted, and should be compared to existing examples
in a comprehensive source such as Gravel's watermark collection, to determine whether the paper was imported or created in the colonies by an individual such as Sellers.

This manuscript's paper consisted of cotton and linen bast fibers, which were period materials used to create
rag pulp for paper in the eighteenth century. This composition confirmed paper creation earlier than 1850, when
paper manufacture transitioned from cotton and linen rag pulp to primarily wood pulp in the mid-nineteenth century. Historically, Britain restricted export of cotton and flax (linen) crops to the colonies, which caused cotton and flax (linen)
crops to become the predominant crops within eighteenth century colonial America. Colonists relied heavily on
these important crops for rag production, which were later turned into rag pulp for paper manufacture.<a href="#footnotes">(19)</a>
Illumination of the paper with ultraviolet light showed no fluorescence or evidence of artificial or chemical
whitening. This is consistent with colonial-era paper making techniques, as artificial whitening commenced during
the late eighteenth century and was a common practice in nineteenth century paper making.<a href="#footnotes">(20)</a>

This manuscript's ink presented as black, fading to brown, color. Ink degradation was prevalent throughout
the document, indicating the ink has aged over an extended period of time. Ink analysis was conducted by a
well-respected professional at a leading research institution. Infrared spectroscopy initially
indicated possible evidence of a modern material, acrylate. However, further investigation
acknowledged how acrylate was used as a mordant in commercial printing ink, but interestingly, not in writing ink.
Its primary function was to decrease the viscosity of ink, making it a very effective additive for printing,
but ineffective for writing.<a href="#footnotes">21)</a> This substance is also UV resistant, which prevented ink from fading. Both
ink degradation and fading on this document demonstrated how its presence could result from contamination caused by the document's amateur storage in plexiglass (poly methyl meth*acrylate*) or another source.<a href="#footnotes">(22)</a> More comprehensive analysis via x-ray fluorescence demonstrated the ink's composition, with significant presence of carbon, copper and calcium, elements consistent with eighteenth century ink. Carbon indicated
the use of soot to color the ink, as in *lamp black* (carbon black) ink; and copper indicated the use of copper
sulfate as a mordant. Calcium was indicative of calcium carbonate, the major component of egg shells, which was
historically used as a base to reduce acidity in colonial ink. Copper sulfate and soot were primary
ingredients in black writing ink for many centuries, and copper sulfate functioned as a mordant to bind the
ink to its writing surface.<a href="#footnotes">(23)</a>

A key element in exemplifying how this manuscript was a true working copy taken directly from the "*Original
with Jefferson*" was discovered during the examination of the horizontal fold lines on the document. Under magnification, the
horizontal fold lines (recto) were observed as convex. It appeared that Adams folded the document to have one
panel accessible at a time while copying the "original", placed either above or beside this document. This
positioning allowed Adams to follow the text line by line, and ensured accuracy in
copying.

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-5.png"></center>

Ink wicked into the surrounding fibers of the fold line validated that the paper was purposefully folded prior
to writing, as the paper sizing was damaged during folding, which allowed the ink to wick into the fold. The text
at the bottom of each panel lined up neatly with each fold, which acted as the edge of paper until another
panel was filled, and the next panel was folded down. After writing was completed, the manuscript
was folded again at the panels with concave folds when Adams wrote the inscription (verso). The extremely well-preserved condition of the recto and text, in contrast to the naturally aged verso, validates this process.
  
In the following image, distinct creases in the manuscript run vertically down the center of the
document. These imprinted crease lines matched the crease and fold lines of the auction booklet,
and confirmed this manuscript was stored within the auction booklet for an extensive
period of time.

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-6.png"></center>

*Editing and Evolution of the Text*

After ascertained the manuscript's authenticity and unique characteristics, it is important to consider how this document was used as an early working draft during the Committee of Five deliberation.
Multiple sections offer further insight into the drafting process, through edits and alterations in the text:
preceding the word "government" was the word "a", which was revised/omitted as the writer
continually edited the document while he produced this copy from the original.

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-7.png"></center>

This finding appeared significant, as neither the known Adams Copy nor the Jefferson Rough Draft contained the
word "a" preceding "government" in this line of the preamble. At first glance, we wondered why such an edit
would hold merit worthy of further discussion; our research team had to consider though, how the editing of the Declaration
was methodically completed by Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, and later by the Congressional body, for better, or
for worse (the latter referring to the deletion of grievances such as the anti-slavery clause post-June 28, 1776).
A probable conclusion for the removal of "a" preceding the word "government" could have been a deliberate attempt by Adams to distinguish "government" as an institution established by, and dedicated
to the people it represents, rather than "a" single entity that could be perceived with autonomy, distant
from its constituents.

The editing continued with multiple capital letters that over-scripted lowercase letters, as
well as the revision of a possessive pronoun:
In the excerpt below, a lowercase "s" is evident underneath the over-scripted "S" in "Secure"; a lowercase "e"
was evident underneath the over-scripted "E" in "Ends"; one can also notice the word "their" resides
underneath the over-scripted/revised "these";

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-8.png"></center>

In this excerpt, the word "Design" had a lowercase "d" that resides under an over-scripted capital
"D". Also noteworthy, the word "evinces" was misspelled as "envinces", which reflected lack of
standardized spelling during this time period.

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-9.png"></center>

In this excerpt, the word "Right" contains a lowercase "r" that resides under an over-scripted capital "R".

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-10.png"></center>

In this excerpt, the word "Object" contained a lowercase "o" that was over-scripted with a capital
"O". 

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-11.png"></center>

Over time, readers of the Declaration have discussed probable reasons for why Committee of Five members
decided to capitalize seemingly random words throughout the text. Early Germanic roots of the English
language demonstrated how capitalization of letters mid-sentence was utilized to place emphasis on significant
words. Throughout the Declaration, especially in this manuscript, nouns were selected to
emphasize words of significance; a characteristic that is evident in the Preamble. 
Capitalization survived the written drafts, into John Dunlap's official print on the eve of July 4. As the approximately two hundred Dunlap broadsides traveled from Dula['s print shop to their respective locations and representatives,
including the copy Washington read to his troops on July 9 in New York City, the intention of this capitalization
was realized as the reader's voice brought life to the Declaration. This manuscript draft has provided the
first opportunity to view the contemplation of words the Declaration's authors felt should hold emphasis within the body of text and when read aloud.

This draft also included a key word that was omitted from the known
Jefferson rough draft, but was present in the Adams fair draft: "To prove this, let the Facts be submitted to a
Candid World, for the Truth of which We pledge a Faith, (as) yet unsullied by Falsehood." In his rough draft's
pre-edit state, Jefferson already omitted the word "as". This finding further bolstered the sequential nature of this manuscript, as Adams created it from the "original" prior to his neater, fair copy, and before Jefferson's rough draft.

<center><img src="/images/sherman-copy-di-12.png"></center>

*Considering the inscription on the verso:*

**"A beginning perhaps- Original with Jefferson - Copied from Original with T.P.'s permission"**

When Adams inscribed "*A beginning perhaps*" as his initial impression of the manuscript, his note
may have reflected the ideological differences that existed between Adams and Paine during that time. "*Perhaps*",
Adams acknowledged his skepticism of the "*Original*"; the lost manuscript that outlined Paine's ideology and originated from an
individual who was not an official member of Congress. Or, "*perhaps*" he provided a hint of sarcasm, a playful jab at Paine
which reflected their ideological dissonance, but acknowledged Paine's permission
to produce a copy from the original.

This inscription's reference to the "*original*" manuscript was again noteworthy, as Boyd reminded us how the lost
original could have been destroyed during the drafting process.  Interestingly, if careful consideration is
given to Adams' word choice, the "*original with Jefferson*" was not referenced as
"Jefferson's original".  If the inscription is interpreted as written, Adams acknowledged the original draft
of the Declaration of Independence was in the possession of Thomas Jefferson, with permission to copy the original
granted by "*T.P.*".

The significance of Paine's writings as a catalyst for the American Revolution has been well-established. It is also
*common* knowledge that Thomas Paine was deliberately excluded from mainstream American history due to his progressive
views and his anti-religious perspective that distanced him from his contemporaries.  This manuscript 
allows us greater insight into Thomas Paine's involvement in the Revolution beyond *Common Sense*, as it seemingly
alleviates the ambiguity of Paine's participation in the creation of the Declaration of Independence and has provided
us a basis for discussing Paine's monumental contributions to the origins of our United States of America.


Again, echoing the words of Thomas Edison, "...truth is governed by natural laws and cannot be denied. Paine
spoke truth with a peculiarly clear and forceful ring. Therefore time must balance the scales." Scholars of
early American history share a responsibility to dialogue and potentially right any listing accounts of our
nation's origins, including Thomas Paine's involvement in the founding of our democracy, for our present and
future generations.
