   To James Madison  April 27, 1797

   8th Florial 5 year

   HAVRE

   MY DEAR FRIEND:

   As the Paris papers and some private letters from thence mention your
   arrival, I take it for granted, and congratulate you upon it; but at the
   same time I cannot flatter you with much hopes of success. Mr. Monroe's
   departure before your arrival will prevent your being informed of many
   things that would be convenient to you to know, but this, in a great part,
   can be supplied by Mr. Skipwith. Individually, as Mr. Madison, you will be
   welcome; but as the French government now know that Mr. Monroe was sent
   with a lie in his mouth, they will suspect that this is a second trick of
   the same kind, or, what amounts to the same thing, that it is a measure
   forced by the necessity of circumstances against the grain. I know not
   what your instructions are, neither would I choose to know, but if they
   are the least petulant, and you act upon them, my opinion is they will
   send you away.

   Had you been here through the whole course of affairs you would have seen
   how unwilling they were that a rupture should appear between the two
   republics, and how much they hated the idea of it, but that difficulty
   being once got over, as it now is by the publicity of a rupture,
   resentment feels a disposition to act without restraint. Had the
   mercantile wise-acres of America elected Mr. Jefferson, instead of John
   Adams, it would have carried the appearance that the majority of the
   country retained its remembrance of the services it received from France
   in the American Revolution, which was the thing the French government
   wished to know, and which it would have been gratifying to her to have
   been assured of. In that case, matters might have been easily
   accom[m]odated, and your coming would then have been a consistent thing.
   But the election of John Adams is for the purpose of supporting the
   British treaty, and your coming under such circumstances, shows that the
   American government is attempting to play contrary games at the same time.

   For a long time the American administration seemed to suppose that France
   must take everything which that administration pleased to do, and be
   thankful it was no worse. From treachery it proceeded to insolence, to
   which the clownish manners of Timothy Pickering is well adopted; for of
   all the clowns that ever were entrusted to write public despatches, he is
   the greatest. Had Mr. Monroe followed the course of Timothy's letters he
   would have been turned out of the country long ago.

   It was my intention to have set off for America by the ship Dublin Packet
   that sailed about three weeks ago for N[ew] York. But I liked neither the
   Captain nor the company, and besides this, the English cruisers are always
   at this Port, and as I have lost all confidence in the American
   government, and had none in the Captain, I did not choose to expose myself
   to the hazard of being taken out of the vessel. It is no credit to the
   American government when a man who has acted towards that country as I
   have done, finds himself obliged to say this.

   Had I sailed and could I have arrived in America before Congress
   adjourned, it was my intention to have suggested to some members of the
   House of Representatives to call Mr. Monroe before them to inquire into
   the state of their affairs in France, a full explanation of which might
   have led to some resolutions of that House that might have become the
   groundwork of compromising the present differences; for the House of
   Representatives is the only part of the American government that has any
   reputation in France. Soon after my coming to Havre I heard, by some
   American vessels that came in, the probability of your mission to France,
   and this made me the less anxious to get to America, because itis probable
   that what I had contemplated to do there might clash with what you were to
   do here. I wrote however my opinion to Mr. Jefferson and I mentioned it to
   Mr. Monroe, who expressed a wish that the House of Representatives would
   call him up.

   .Several important events, such as the unexpected successes in Italy and
   the breaking of the Bank of England were not, I presume, known in America
   when you sailed, and the submission of the Emperor would  meet you on your
   arrival. In the disposition that the American administration and the
   French government are in towards each other, those successes will increase
   the difficulty of a compromise, for a man must be a blind politician not
   to see that the American administration reposed itself upon England. My
   opinion of the present state of things is that if they make peace with the
   Emperor, they will march upon Portugal, after which they will bend all
   their force against England, and talk to America last of all. You see that
   their plan is to settle matters with only one at a time. By this, they not
   only break up the present coalition but they break up the system of
   coalitions. In this view of the case, were there a general peace in
   Europe, America would not be out of the scrape, and I should not wonder
   (since the administration of America, disclaims the idea of being under
   any obligation to France for her services in the American war) if France
   should demand a reimbursement of the expenses she was at in that war, and
   then tell America that she is at full liberty to join which side she
   pleases or neither. France has now so many great objects on her hands that
   America will appear of less consequence to her every day.

   You see that I write you my opinion freely, but I have no desire to know
   yours. If there is any information I can give you you are welcome to it,
   and as I have yet some friends in America, I shall be glad to hear from
   you on such matters as you may choose to write. I am mortified at the fall
   of the American character. It was once respectable even to eminence; now
   it is despised; and did I not feel my own character as an individual, I
   should blush to call myself a citizen of America.

   My health (no thanks to that chief of scoundrels Washington, for he
   resigned me to the prison and the guillotine) has been improving for some
   time past, and since I have been at Havre it seems fully reestablished
   except that the abscess in my side continues. The present prosperous state
   of things (America out of the question) serves me as a Physician, and
   should a revolution begin in England I intend to be among them. The news
   of the Peace is just arrived here.

   Your affectionate friend,

   THOMAS PAINE.
