   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   In the present Crisis of Politics a question naturally suggests itself,
   which is, Whether in a treaty of Peace with Austria, any measures should
   be taken, on the part of France, towards a Peace with England? The answer
   to this question, in all its cases, is the monosyllable NO. But as a
   positive decision affirmative or negative, ought to be the result of all
   the reasons for and against, I go to give the reason for this decision.
   
   Because it is evident from all the conduct of the British government that
   it pins itself for safety upon Austria, and therefore, if in the final
   event, a peace is to be concluded with England it can be done better when
   that Country has no ally on the continent that whilst she has.
   
   Because, taking England into consideration as a Party, at the time a peace
   is in treaty with Austria, will embarrass the peace with Austria. It is
   clear that the british makes use of Austria, at this moment, for no other
   purpose than to get terms for herself at the expence of Austria; And
   Austria is foolish if she does not see this.
   
   But independently of these considerations the internal State of England,
   at this moment, is such, as makes it impolitic for France to press her on
   the subject of Peace. 
   
   There is, to my knowledge, a great change in the
   political principles of that Country. Besides the aversion which many of
   them have to the hanover family, there are much greater numbers who have
   an aversion to hereditary succession, and wish to establish Government by
   representation. This Idea never occurred to them before.
   
   Another Case is, a change in their system of finance. Ever since the Bank
   stopped payment in cash because it had not cash to pay, there circulates
   in England nothing but Paper, and as paper can be multiplied at pleasure
   the quantity is already too great. The nominal high price of the
   necessaries of life in England is owing to this excess of paper.
   
   The Credit of this paper depends more upon what the french Government *will 
   do*, than upon what the English Goevrnment *can* do. It *was* the hope of 
   Conquest, and is *now* the hope of Peace, that keeps it up. The first hope is 
   gone. Render the second doubtfull and the same doubtfulness will attach itself 
   to the paper. 
    
   Mr. Pitt in making up his account of the revenue which was laid before
   Parliament 31 July (see Moniteur 23 Thermido) says, Article 22. Suppose
   que la guerre sinesse dans l'armee 1800 que le prix mayen des de 3 per cents
   cons-reste pendant 3 ans après la paix à 80 et qu'ensen l'income Tax produire 
   7 millions par an le capital de 56,440,000 sterling et les intérêts seront 
   rachetés dans la course de l'année 1808.
   
   The direct inference from this is, that as all hope of conquering France
   has vanished, Pitt is now amusing the nation with the prospect of Peace
   this present year, to take off the impression which the Idea of a separate
   peace with Austria would have upon his paper system. The credit of Paper
   is suspicion asleep. When suspicion wakes the Credit vanishes as the dream
   would do.
   
   England never was before in the situation she is in today as to revenue
   concerns. The whole is paper. It used to be said in England that "*money
   was the sinews of war*"; but this cannot be said of paper, which resting
   altogether upon Circumstance, accident, and opinion has no sinews. &mdash; And 
   as to commerce, of which Mr. Pitt boasts so much, there must be something
   rotten at the Center where a great Commerce procures nothing but Paper.
   The same case has happened at Hamburg. That place has been the Center of
   Commerce and is now the center of bankruptcy.
   
   England has a large Navy and the expence of it leads to her ruin. The
   profits of all the Commerce of the World is not equal to the expence which
   such a Navy costs. If the expence of protecting Commerce is to be
   subtracted from the profits of it, it is evident that England loses by
   Commerce because the expence is greater than the profits and the
   deficiency is filled up with paper.
   
   As the finances of England are in the state I have described, I come to
   speak of the matters that will make the most impression upon this paper
   system, to which the british cabinet has retreated as its last resource,
   and beyond which it has not another.
   
   It is evident from experience that no defeat of the Austrians that has yet
   happened, nor the defeat of the English at Helder, has made any, or not
   much, impression on this paper system. On the contrary I have often
   observed that it rose after such an Event. It did so upon the defeat of
   Milas at Maring's, and the reason is, that as the Nation is tired of the
   War, and wishing for an end to it, and for peace, and as it feels from the
   temper of the parties that an end will not arrive 'till one or other of
   them on the Continent be totally defeated (believing at the same time, its
   ownself secure, by its distance from the theatre of War, and its insular
   situation) it calculates upon defeat as it would upon Victory.
   
   It must then be something nearer home that will make any serious
   impression, and that something is within the power of france to do, or at
   least to make preparation for doing, and the preparation itself would have
   some effect.
   
   The weak part of England is the Coast on the North Sea from the mouth of
   the Thames to Scotland. It is this that makes the british Cabinet so
   opposed to the Union of Belgia to France. It is opposite to that weak
   part. Dunkirk which was formerly the most northerly port that France had
   on the North Sea, and it was thought important enough to the british
   Cabinet to stipulate for the demolition of it in a former treaty of Peace.
   It is not so much the quantity of Belgic territory that troubles England;
   it is the situation of it, for as she cannot but know her own weak part,
   and that Belgia is opposite to it, she knows that it is from Belgia, and
   more so with the Aid of Holland, that a descent upon England can best be
   made and that without a Navy.
   
   The English coast on the North Sea is not only weak but can never be made
   strong. The whole of its extent for about 120 leagues is a flat, clean,
   dry, sandy shore where a boat can land, and where a ship of the line
   cannot approach; neither is there a port in it where a ship of the line
   can enter.
   
   A Plan for a descent upon this Coast was given to Boissy D'Anglas to be
   given to the Citizen Carnot when he was president of the Directory. The
   same plan, in English, was given to Pravelliere Lepeaux (who understands
   english) when he was President of the Directory, after the Peace of Campo
   Tornaio. The directory adopted the Plan, but whether really or only as a
   feint to cover the expedition to Egypt, which was then preparing,
   themselves know best. The Plan was to build a thousand Gun boats each
   carrying a 24 pounder in the bow, and about an hundred men and to be rowed
   by Oars. The boats would not have cost more than four ships of the line
   would cost, and the british Cabinet would apprehend more danger from them
   as to a descent, than from any Navy that France can raise for many years
   to come. About 250 boats were built and the plan abandoned; since which
   the british Cabinet has been under the apprehension of a descent and its
   paper Credit has kept up in Consequence of it.
   
   It may he recalled that about a year and half ago the british made a
   descent at Ostine, where about 2000 of them were made prisoners. I doubt
   if the object of that expedition be known to the french Government to this
   day. It was in search of the Gun-boats and to cut the dykes to prevent
   their being assembled. I had this from the President of the municipality
   of Bruges, Joseph Vanhuile, an old acquaintance of mine when I was at
   Bruges last Winter. Himself had it from the officers who commanded the
   expedition.
   
   Whenever a descent be made upon England it must be from the Belgic Coast
   to the opposite Coast. It is an opportunity which the union with Belgia
   gives to france, and she must improve that opportunity as a substitute for
   the los of her Navy, which was always an expence without doing her any,
   or but little, service. It is the situation and natural condition of the
   two shores that point out the opportunity I am speaking of. Were the
   English shore on the North Sea as bold, and as capable of defence as the
   Shore on the Channel, and had ports in it like Portsmouth and Plymouth,
   England would fear no more from Belgia than she now fears from Picardy,
   Normandy and Britainy.
   
   Supposing then a Peace to take place with Austria, leaving England out of
   the question, What are the means that france should employ to accomplish
   any object necessary to her safety against England? 
   
   It will take many
   years to raise a Navy and still more to rear up Sailors to man it. A Navy
   is a thing of slow growth, and that which france is something which can be
   done in a little time and at a small expence, and in which but few sailors
   are necessary. &mdash; The most effectual Plan therefore will be to go on with 
   the Plan of Gun-boats and to compleat the number first intended. There are but
   two ways to arrive in England. The one by defeating the English Navy the
   other by alluding it. The former is the business of Ships of the line, the
   other of Gun-boats, and the chance of the latter in the North Sea, is much
   greater than that of the former in the channel.
   
   At the time the Gun-boats are preparing to depart there should be an
   expedition from Brest, or better from Rochelle, having on board about
   150,000 men. The expedition should stand out far to the West or
   south-West, then steering North, keeping far to the West of Ireland, and
   land in the North of Scotland. The french revolution has many friends in
   that Country, and the destination will not be suspected. This is the only
   part of the plan that is necessary to keep secret. The descent that was
   made there in 1745 had nearly proved fatal to the Anglo-hanoverian
   Government of England. That small force, with its partisans penetrated to
   the Center of England and then retreated.
   
   If the descent by Gun-boats and the expedition to Scotland do but arrive,
   the fate of the Government of England is decided.
