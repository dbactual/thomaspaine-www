   From the original letter at the New-York Historical Society.

   MONDAY MORNG, Nov.26th, 81

   Sir

   I am much obliged to you for the Abbe Raynal' History. I have made some
   extracts from it, which has occasioned me to keep it longer than I
   intended. There are several mistakes in it, and his opinions are often
   in contradiction to one another. &mdash; His account of the rejection of the offers
   of the British Ministry pages 133, 134, 135 is erroneous. I send you my
   remarks thereon, which you will please return to me when you have perused
   them. His idea of the Alliance is injurious, because it is not so much
   what motives brought them together, as what consequences will ensue from it
   that is the object of philosophical enquiry. And all other considerations
   apart, the Alliance has a tendency to free the mind of Prejudice &mdash; I can
   feel it in myself &mdash; But his account of the confederated powers page (162)
   is truly cynical. pages 149 & 155 touches on a political secret.

   I am sorry to see Mr. Deane's letters gett into our papers, as I am very
   apprehensive they were written for the purpose of publication, and not
   with a design of being sent to the persons they are directed to. I have
   mentioned this to Bailey the printer, and advised him to discontinue them,
   and the more so, as the remarks he makes on them is not equal to the
   poison they infuse.

   I return you my thanks for your kindness to Temple Harris the bearer of
   this &mdash; He is an honest diligent obliging youth, and I am persuaded will
   answer Mr. Whiteside's expectations.

   Col. Eveleigh lent me some English News-papers of yours &mdash; I returned them
   yesterday except two, which I have sent to the printers &mdash; The Col.
   desired me to mention this to you as you will find them two short of the
   proper number &mdash; the other two will be returned on Thursday &mdash;

   I am Sir your Ob. Hble Servt

   THOMAS PAINE &mdash;

   P. S. Contrary to my Expectations the Attack on Augustine, by the Spaniards,
   is spoke of by the S: C. Gentlemen as an agreeable
   circumstance to them.
