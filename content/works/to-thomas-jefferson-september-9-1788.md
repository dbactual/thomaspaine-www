   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   London, Broad Street Building, No. 13, Sep. 9th, 1788

   Dear Sir

   That I am a bad correspondent is so general a Complaint against me, that I
   must expect the same accusation from you &mdash; But hear me first. &mdash; 
   When there is
   no matter to write upon a letter is not worth the trouble of receiving
   and reading, and while any thing, which is to be the subject of a letter, is
   in suspense, it is difficult to write and perhaps best to let it
   alone &mdash; "*least said is soonest mended*", and nothing said requires no
   mending.

   The Model has the good fortune of preserving in England the reputation
   which it received from the Academy of Sciences. It is a favourite hobby
   horse with all who have seen it; and every one who have talked with me on
   the subject advised me to endeavour to obtain a Patent, as it is only by
   that means that I can secure to myself the direction and management. 
   &mdash; For
   this purpose I went, (in company with Mr. Whiteside) to the office which is
   an appendage to Lord Sydney's &mdash; told them who I was, and 
   made an affidavid that the construction was my own invention &mdash; 
   This was the only step I took in the business. &mdash; Last Wednesday 
   I received a patent for England, the next day a Patent for Scotland, 
   and I am to have one for Ireland.

   As I had already the opinion of the Scientific Judges both in France and
   England on the model; it was also necessary that I should have that of the
   practical Iron men who must finally be the executors of the work. 
   
   There
   are several capital Iron Works in this Country, the principal of which are
   those in Shropshire, Yorkshire, and Scotland. It was my intention to have
   communicated with Mr. Wilkinson &mdash; who is one of the proprietors of the
   Shropshire Iron Works and concerned in those in France &mdash; 
   but his departure
   for Sweden before I had possession of the patents prevented me. 
   
   The Iron
   Works in Yorkshire belonging to the Walkers near to Sheffield are the most
   eminent in England in point of establishment and property &mdash; 
   the proprietors
   are reputed to be worth two hundred thousand pounds and consequently
   capable of giving energy to any great undertaking. A friend of theirs who
   had seen the model wrote to them on the Subject, and two of them came to
   London last Fryday to see it and talk with me on the business. 
   
   Their
   opinion is very decided that it can be executed either in Wrought or Cast
   Iron and I am to go down to their works next week to erect an experiment
   Arch. This is the point I am now got to, and until now I had nothing to
   inform you of. &mdash; If I succeed in erecting the Arch all 
   reasoning and opinion
   will be at an end, and as this will soon be known, I shall not return to
   France till that time, and until then I wish every thing to remain,
   respecting my Bridge over the Seine, in the State I left matters in when I
   came from France. With respect to the Patents in England it is my
   intention to dispose of them as soon as I have established the certainty
   of the Construction.

   Besides the ill success of Blackfriars Bridge, two Bridges built
   successively on the same spot, the last by Mr. Smeaton, at Hexham, over
   the Tyne in Northumberland have fallen down occasioned by quicksands
   under the bed of the river. &mdash; If therefore Arches can 
   be extended in the
   proportion the model promises, the Construction in certain situations,
   without regard to cheapness or dearness, will be valuable in all
   Countries.

   I enclose you a Philadelphia Paper 10 of July having the account of the
   Procession of the 5th of that month. An Arrival from Philadelphia which
   left it the 26th July brings nothing new &mdash; The Convention of New York
   was still sitting, but we have accounts, tho' I know not how they came,
   that the Convention of N. York acceded on the 29th of July. &mdash; (I since
   hear that this account is brought by the Columbine in 29 days from N.
   York, arrived at Falmouth, with wheat to Lisbon. &mdash;

   As to English news or Politics, here is little more than what the Public
   papers contain. &mdash; The assembling the States General, and 
   the reappointment
   of Mr. Neckar, made considerable impression here. They overawe a great
   deal of the English habitual rashness and check that triumph of
   presumption which they indulged themselves in with respect to what they
   called the deranged and almost ruinous condition of the finances of
   France. They acknowledge unreservedly that the natural resources of france
   are greater than those of England, but they plume themselves on the
   superiority of the means necessary to bring national resources forth. But
   the two circumstances above mentioned serve very well to lower this
   exaltation.

   Some time ago I spent a week at Mr. Burkes and the Duke of Portland's in
   Buckinghamshire &mdash; you will recollect that the Duke 
   was the Minister during
   the time of the Coalition &mdash; he is now in the opposition, and I find the
   opposition as much warped in some respects as to Continental Politics as
   the Ministry. 
   
   What the extent of the Treaty with Russia is, Mr. B &mdash;
   says that he and all the opposition are totally unacquainted with, and
   they speak of it not as a very wise measure, but rather tending to involve
   England in unnecessary continental disputes. The preference of the
   opposition is to a connection with Prussia if it could have been obtained.
   
   Sir George Staunton tells me that the interference with respect to Holland
   last year met with considerable opposition from part of the 
   Cabinet &mdash; Mr.
   Pitt was against it at first, but it was a favourite measure with the King,
   and that the opposition at that Crisis contrived to have it known to him
   that they were disposed to support his measures. This together with the
   notification of the 16th of Sept. gave Mr. Pitt cause and pretence for
   changing his ground. &mdash;

   The Marquis of Lansdown is unconnected either with the Ministry or the
   opposition. His politics is distinct from both. His plan is a sort of
   Armed neutrality which has many advocates. In Conversation with me he
   reprobated the Conduct of the Ministry towards France last year as
   operating to "*cut the throat of confidence*" (this was his expression)
   between France and England at a time when there was a fair opportunity of
   improving it.

   The Enmity of this Country against Russia is as bitter as it ever was
   against America and is carried to every Pitch of abuse and vulgarity.
   What I hear in Conversations exceeds what may be seen in the news-papers.
   They are sour and mortified at every success she acquires and voraciously
   believe and rejoice in the most improbable accounts and rumours to the
   contrary. You may mention this to Mr. Simelin on any terms you please for
   you cannot exceed the fact.

   There are those who amuse themselves here in the hopes of managing Spain.
   The notification which the Marquis del Campo made last year to the British
   Cabinet is, perhaps, the only secret kept in this Country. 
   Mr. B &mdash; tells me that the opposition knows nothing of it. 
   
   They all very freely admit
   that if the Combined fleets had had thirty or forty thousand land forces
   when they came up the channel last War, there was nothing in England to
   oppose their landing, and that such a measure would have been fatal to
   their resources, by, at least a temporary destruction of national credit.
   &mdash; This is the point on which this Country is most impressionable. Wars,
   carried on at a distance, they care but little about, and seem always
   disposed to enter into them &mdash; It is bringing the matter 
   home to them that
   makes them fear and feel, for their weakest part is at home. This I take
   to be the reason of the attention they are paying to Spain, for while
   France and Spain make a Common Cause and *start* together, they may easily
   overawe this Country.

   I intended sending this letter by Mr. Parker, but he goes by way of
   Holland and as I do not chuse to send it by the English Post. I shall
   desire Mr. Bartholemy to forward it to you.

   Remember me with much Affection to the Marquis de la Fayette. This letter
   will serve for two letters &mdash; whether I am in London or the Country 
   any letter to me at Mr. Whiteside's, Merchant, No. 13 Broad Street 
   Buildings, will come safe &mdash; My compliments to Mr. Short.

   I am Dear Sir with great Esteem of your obliged Friend & obt. 
   Hble servant

   THOMAS PAINE
