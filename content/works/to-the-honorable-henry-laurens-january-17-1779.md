   To the Honorable Henry Laurens  January 17, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   DEAR SIR :

   I received the additional testimony of your friendship, for which, it is
   needless to say, you have my thanks. It is true that I have subjected
   myself to present inconveniences, but I beg leave to mention that it is my
   design to publish all of my political and other writings in two volumes,
   and to set a proper price upon them. I shall begin with the pamphlet
   Common Sense; and this I believe will make some recompense for the trouble
   I have been at hitherto. And though I have constantly given everything I
   have yet published to the public gratis, yet no gentleman will expect that
   I should give away in volumes.

   I feel myself exceedingly hurt by some expressions in Mr. Gerard's letter
   to Congress of the 14th inst. I have mentioned them to Mr. Mirales and
   shall write to Mr. Gerard on the subject.

   The expressions are:

   "I entreat you to receive and to express to Congress the great sensibility
   with which their frank, noble and categorical manner of destroying those
   false and dangerous insinuations which might mislead ignorant people, and
   put arms into the hands of the enemy."

   I find myself obliged to tell him that I think it convenient to absent
   myself from the company even of my most intimate friends till he shall be
   pleased to explain that I am not personally alluded to in this paragraph.
   I believe my apprehensions were not ill grounded when I said that I
   believed they wished to get me to submit to a censure.

   The resolution of Congress is more moderate than is either Mr. Jay's or
   Mr. Gerard's letter. I mean to give Mr. Gerard a most polite opportunity
   of doing me justice.

   I am, dear sir, your most obedient and obliged humble servant,

   T. PAINE.

   Please excuse a scrawl, as I am in haste to get my letter to Mr. G[erard]
   completed. It is a nice step, but I think I shall manage it with address.
