   To Thomas Jefferson  November, 1802

   BALTIMORE,

   DEAR SIR:

   I arrived here on Saturday from Havre, after a passage of sixty days. I
   have several cases of models, wheels, etc., and as soon as I can get them
   from the vessel and put them on board the packet for Georgetown I shall
   set off to pay my respects to you.

   Your much obliged fellow-citizen,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. I have a letter for you from Mr. Dublois respecting the Consulship
   of Havre.
