   Dear Sir

   I arrived here on Saturday from Havre after a passage of 60 days. I
   have several Cases of models of Bridges, wheels &c and as soon as I can get them
   from the Vessel and, put them on board the packet for Georgetown I shall
   set off to pay my respects to you.

   your much obliged fellow Citizen,

   Thomas Paine

   P. S. I have a letter for you from Mr. Dublois respecting the Consulship
   of Havre.
