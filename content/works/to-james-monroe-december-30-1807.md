   To James Monroe  December 30, 1807

   Broome Street, New York,

   DEAR SIR:

   I congratulate and welcome you very sincerely on your return home. The
   British Government is mad and every thing [they] do or attempt to do prove
   them to be so. I received a letter from London dated Oct[ober] 15 which I
   have sent for publication to the Philadelphia Aurora. The writer says, "It
   is believed here (London) that "war with America is resolved on."

   I have numerous friends in England, and perhaps you are acquainted with
   some of them. Do you know Sir Francis Burdett, or Col. Bosville of Wilbeck
   Street. They came to Paris a short time before I left it for America and I
   received great attention and friendship from them. They are strong Rights
   of Man's Men.

   If I recollect right some Bankers at Brussels, I think Baron Walkers was
   one, made you an offer when you were at Paris of a loan of money for the
   United States. Should we get into trouble with the unprincipled government
   of England a resource of this kind may be useful. I remind you of it that
   you may, if you see it proper, mention it to the President.

   If you have any information respecting the condition of England or the
   policy and plans of its government that I can make a good use of without
   saying how I came by it, I will be obliged to you for it. Is there any
   talk of a descent upon England? I wish to see that corrupt, unprincipled
   and oppressive government pulled down.

   I hold my health very well, but I am a great deal disabled in my powers of
   walking. Present my compliments and respects to Mrs. Monroe.

   Yours in Friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.
