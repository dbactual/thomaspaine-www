   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.

   Dear Sir

   Since writing the enclosed, a messenger arrived with a letter from you for
   Col. Laurens, who is gone to take leave &mdash;

   Col. Laurens in making out his arrangement of supplies as mentioned in my
   note to you wants some commercial information, and if Mr. Williams can
   make it convenient to be here early tomorrow morning it will, I know, be
   convenient to the Col. which is the purpose of my letter to Mr. W &mdash;
   therefore if you do not see him to day &mdash; I should be glad you could forward
   it to St. Germain &mdash; I have likewise sent a line on the same purpose to Mr.
   Alexander at his hotel

   I am Dear Sir with much Esteem your ob hble servt

   THOS PAINE

   I should be glad of half an hour conversation with you as I want much to
   mention to you something respecting a person (whom we both know) and his
   very extraordinary conversation in this Country.
