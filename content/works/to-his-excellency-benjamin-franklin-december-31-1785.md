   TO HIS EXCELLENCY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, ESQUIRE  December 31, 1785.

   DEAR SIR:

   I send you the candles I have been making. In a little time after they are
   lighted the smoke and flame separate, the one issuing from one end of the
   candle, and the other from the other end. I suppose this to be because a
   quantity of air enters into the candle between the tallow and the flame,
   and in its passage downwards takes the smoke with it; for if you blow a
   quantity of air up the candle, the current will be changed, and the smoke
   reascends, and in passing this the flame makes a small flash and a little
   noise.

   But to express the idea I mean, of the smoke descending more clearly it is
   this,-that the air enters the candle in the very place where the mellow
   tallow is getting into the state of flame, and takes it down before the
   change is completed-for there appears to me to be two kinds of smoke,
   humid matter which never can be flame, and inflammable matter which would
   be flame if some accident did not prevent the change being completed-and
   this I suppose to be the case with the descending smoke of the candle.

   As you can compare the candle with the lamp, you will have an opportunity
   of ascertaining the cause-why it will do in the one and not in the other.
   When the edge of the enflamed part of the wick is close with the edge of
   the tin of the lamp no counter current of air can enter-but as this
   contact does not take place in the candle a counter current enters and
   prevents the effect in the candles which illuminates the lamp. For the
   passing of the air through the lamp does not, I imagine, burn the smoke,
   but burns up all the oil into flame, or by its rapidity prevents any part
   of the oil flying off in the state of half-flame which is smoke.

   I do not, my dear sir, offer these reasons to you but to myself, for I
   have often observed that by lending words for my thoughts I understand my
   thoughts the better. Thoughts are a kind of mental smoke, which require
   words to illuminate them.

   I am affectionately your obedient and humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   I hope to be well enough tomorrow to wait on you.
