   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.

   Dec. 31st 1785

   I send you the Candles I have been making. In a little time after they are
   lighted the smoke and flame separate, the one issuing from one end of the
   candle, and the other from the other end. I suppose this to be because a
   quantity of Air enters into the candle between the Tallow and the flame,
   and in its passage downwards takes the smoke with it, for if you blow a
   quantity of air up the Candle, the current will be changed, and the Smoke
   re-ascends and in passing this the flame makes a small flash and a little
   noise.

   But to express the Idea I mean, of the smoke descending more clearly it is
   this, &mdash; that the Air enters the candle in the very place 
   where the melted
   tallow is getting into the state of flame, and takes it down before the
   change is completed &mdash; for there appears to me to be two kinds of smoke,
   humid matter which never can be flame, &mdash; and inflammable matter 
   which would
   be flame if some accident did not prevent the change being 
   completed &mdash; and
   this I suppose to be the case with the descending smoke of the Candle.

   As you can compare the Candle with the Lamp, you will have an opportunity
   of ascertaining the cause &mdash; why it will do in the one 
   and not in the other &mdash; 
   When the edge of the inflamed part of the wick is close with the edge of
   the Tin of the Lamp no counter current of air can enter &mdash; but as this
   contact does not take place in the candle a counter current can enter and
   prevents the effect in the candles, which illuminates the Lamp 
   &mdash; for the
   passing of the Air through the Lamp does not, I imagine, burn the smoke,
   but burns up all the oil into flame, or by its rapidity prevents any part
   of the oil flying off in the state of half-flame which is smoke &mdash;

   I do not my dear Sir, offer these reasons to you but to myself, for I
   have often observed that by lending words for my thoughts I understand my
   thoughts the better &mdash; Thoughts are a kind of mental smoke, 
   which require words to illuminate them.

   I am affectionately your obt hble servant

   THOMAS PAINE

   I hope to be well enough tomorrow to wait on you.
