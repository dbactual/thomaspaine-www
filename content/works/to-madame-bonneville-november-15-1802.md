   Washington Nov 15 1802

   My Dear Madam and my dear Boys

   I this moment received your letter with great pleasure for I was anxious
   for your safety on the passage, as the weather with us was several times
   stormy. You enclose me a bill for Â£22,10s. Sterling payable to Capt.
   Stanley, for the balance of your passage. I will be obliged to Capt.
   Stanley to tell me in what manner I shall remit the money to him and it
   shall be done immediately. I have written to Col. Kirkbride of
   Borden Tow, in the State of New Jersey, who will expect your coming there,
   and from whom you will receive every friendship. I expect to be there
   myself in about a month or five weeks. If you are in want of money to
   continue your Journey to Bordentown I will be obliged to any of my
   friends in Norfolk to supply you and I will remit it to them as soon as I
   am informed of it. I can depend on your oeconomy in the use of it, and you
   and the poor boys can rest upon my friendship. I am not personally
   acquainted with Col. Newton of Norfolk but I find he is a friend of Mr.
   Madison the Secretary of State, and if Col. Newton will be so
   kind as to supply you with what money you may want I will repay it
   immediately into the hands of Mr. Madison or remit it to him through the
   post master.

   I suppose your best way will be to come up the bay by the packet to
   Baltimore and from thence to Philadelphia and Borden Town. If you should
   have to stay two or three days at Baltimore enquire for Capt. Clark Bond
   street No. 102. He is the captain of the ship in which I came. I shall
   write to Mrs. Clark to inform her of your coming.

   The letter you have from Mr. Mercier for Mr. Jefferson you can enclose
   under Cover to me either from Norfolk, or more conveniently from
   Baltimore if you come that way. Mr. Murray a merchant who several times
   called upon me at your house in Paris, lives now in Baltimore but I do
   not know his address. Embrace the poor boys for me and tell them they will
   soon see me at Bordent-Town. I shall write again to Col. Kirkbride to inform
   him of your arrival.

   Your sincere affectionate friend

   Thomas Paine
