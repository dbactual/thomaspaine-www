   AN ESSAY FOR THE USE OF NEW REPUBLICANS IN THEIR OPPOSITION TO

   MONARCHY

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   The following Essay was first published in Le Patriote Francois of October
   20, 1792. The setting in France at the time Paine wrote this article was
   extremely exciting. On September 20, 1792, at Valmy, the French army was
   able to stop the invading enemies and force them to retreat. On that same
   day, the National Convention met in Paris and, a day later, royalty was
   abolished in France. The next day it was decreed that September 22 should
   be regarded as the beginning of the First Year of the French Republic. A
   few days after this address was published, Paine was delegated to
   congratulate the Convention on the steps taken after September 20th. His
   statement went: "Citizen President: In behalf of my fellow-deputies and of
   the General Council of the Commune of Calais I have the honor of
   congratulating the Convention on the abolition of Royalty. At the same
   time, I must, in the midst of the popular rejoicing, express my regret
   that the folly of our ancestors should compel us to treat with such
   solemnity the laying of a phantom."

   THE attainment of any important possession that we have long been ardently
   coveting is at once a source of subsequent self-congratulation. Indeed,
   the feeling that we have triumphed so absorbs us that we immediately lose
   the sense of the cause of our success. But, after dwelling awhile on our
   new happiness, we verify all the incidents that have produced it, and the
   examination of each of them separately still further enhances our
   satisfaction. It is our present purpose to develop fully the reasons why
   our readers should participate in our enjoyment.

   All French citizens have joined in celebrating the downfall of Royalty and
   the creation of a Republic, yet, among those who applaud, there are some
   persons who have not an entirely clear comprehension of their former
   situation or of that upon which they are now entering.

   All Frenchmen have shuddered at the perjuries of the King, the plots of
   his Court and the profligacy of his brothers; so that the race of Louis
   was deposed from the throne of their hearts long before it was deposed by
   legislative decree. We do not effect much, however, if we merely dethrone
   an idol; we must also break to pieces the pedestal upon which it rested.
   It is the office of royalty rather than the holder of the office that is
   fatal in its consequences. But everyone has not a vivid conception of this
   fact.

   Yet all Frenchmen should be able in the present conjuncture to prove the
   absurdity of Royalty and the reasonableness of a Republic, whenever these
   forms of government are discussed; because if you now enjoy freedom and
   happiness, you should be conscious of the reasons for your contentment.

   As a distinction is drawn frequently between Royalty and Monarchy, we had
   better examine into the question of the pertinency of this distinction.

   The system of Royalty has begun in the same fashion in all countries and
   among all peoples. A band of robbers, gathered together under a leader,
   throw themselves on a country and make slaves of its people; then they
   elect their leader king. Next comes another robber chief, who conquers and
   kills the first, and makes himself king in his stead. After a time, the
   recollection of all this violence is obliterated, and the successors of
   the robber are held to reign quite legitimately. They are shrewd enough to
   confer a few benefits now and then on their subjects; they corrupt those
   about them, and, to give an air of sanctity to their origin, they devise
   pedigrees that are purely fictitious; afterward, they are aided by the
   dishonesty of the priests, and religion befriends their usurped power,
   which will henceforth be regarded as their hereditary possession.

   The consequences that flow from Royalty are such as might be expected from
   its source. The annals of monarchy abound in such hideous wickedness, such
   horrible cruelties that only by reading them can we form any idea of the
   baseness of which human nature is capable. The pictures that we there
   behold of kings and their ministers and courtiers are so horrifying that
   humanity is forced to turn away from them with a shudder.

   And yet what else could be expected? Kings are monsters in the natural
   order, and what can we expect from monsters but miseries and crimes? Now,
   what is Monarchy? Whatever effort may have been made to conceal its true
   nature and to familiarize the people with that hateful term, its real
   meaning cannot be disguised: it signifies absolute power vested in a
   single person, although that person be a fool, a traitor or a tyrant. Do
   we not outrage national honor when we suggest the possibility of any
   people being ruled by such a person as I have denoted?

    But, apart from the defects of the individual, government by a single
   person is vicious in itself. A prince is too small a person himself to be
   capable of governing even the smallest state. What an absurdity it is,
   then, to believe in his capacity for the government of a great nation!

    However, you will say, there have been kings who were men of genius.
   Granted: but such intelligent rulers have been a greater curse to nations
   than those who were intellectually deficient. Kings of that class have
   always been ambitious, and have compelled their subjects to pay dearly for
   the conquests and Te-deums that were celebrated over the land while its
   inhabitants were dying of hunger. We have only to turn to the career of
   Louis XIV and of other sovereigns in proof of the truth of this statement.

   What, however, of those rulers who have no claim to ability, and who
   substitute for it the vices that seem inherent in Royalty? We have the
   following description of them in the Contract Social of J. J. Rousseau:

   "The men who take the foremost place in monarchies are often simply base
   marplots, ordinary rogues, mean intriguers. The trivial intellectual
   qualities that have raised these people to high positions in courts but
   serve to make more apparent to the public their real insignificance." In a
   word, the story of all monarchies supplies proof that, while monarchs do
   nothing, their ministers do nothing but evil.

   While Royalty is harmful from its very nature, hereditary Royalty is, in
   addition, absurd and disgusting. Just think of it! Yonder is a man who
   claims that he has a hereditary right to rule me! Where did he get it?
   From his ancestors, he says, and from mine. But how could they give him a
   right they did not possess? No man has power over posterity. I can no more
   be the slave of those who went before me than I can of those who now
   exist. If we returned to life, we could not rob ourselves of the rights
   acquired in a second existence; still less could we rob

   posterity of their rights.

   A hereditary crown! A throne to be handed over to a successor! Why, it is
   to treat our posterity as a herd of cattle who are entirely destitute of
   either rights or will. No more infamous and indecent illusion ever
   disgraced humanity than that the people is a herd which may be transmitted
   from one king to another.

   From one point of view, we should not, perhaps, censure kings for their
   savage cruelty, their brutality and their oppressions; it is not they who
   are in fault; it is hereditary succession: a swamp breeds serpents;
   hereditary succession breeds oppressors.

   The following is the system of logic upon which are founded the claims of
   Royalty: "I," says the hereditary prince, "owe my authority to my birth; I
   owe my birth to God; therefore, I owe nothing to men." When he has a
   subservient minister, he then proceeds to commit all the crimes of which
   tyranny is capable, and he never has any idea that he is acting
   wrongfully. We have plenty of evidence of this fact in the history of all
   countries.

   You must also see clearly that there must be an entire absence of sympathy
   between ruler and people. What renders us kind and humane? Is it not
   sympathy, the power which I have of putting myself in my neighbor's place?
   How can a monarch have sympathy? He can never put himself in anybody's
   place, for the simple reason that he can never be in any place but his
   own.

   A monarch is naturally and preeminently an egotist. We have innumerable
   proofs which show that such a person is altogether separated from
   humanity. When Charles II was asked to punish Lauderdale for his cruelty
   to the Scots, his reply was: "Lauderdale may have oppressed the Scots, but
   he has always supported my interests." A frequent expression of Louis XIV
   was: "If I were to comply with the will of my people, I should not be
   King." He lost his temper when anyone spoke of the "safety of the State,"
   or "the calamities of the State."

   We might not object to the hereditary succession of kings, if we could
   always be certain that the throne should be occupied by a wise and
   virtuous prince. If, however, we but consider the character of those who
   sit on the thrones of Europe at the present hour, what do we discover? We
   find that the men who fill them are either fools or tyrants or traitors or
   libertines, and that in some of them are combined all imaginable vices. It
   would thus seem that nature and destiny have agreed in the present age to
   supply us with tangible evidence of the atrocious wickedness and folly of
   Royalty.

   Yet, after all, there is nothing distinctive about the present age in this
   relation. Hereditary succession is so essentially vicious that it is
   impossible for the people to hope for the advent of a virtuous prince. A
   person educated in the belief that he has a right to command others is
   inevitably bound by his surroundings to lose all sense of reason and
   justice.

   In fact, were not this notion of hereditary kings a serious matter, we
   might feel inclined to laugh at the absurdity of such an institution. We
   have to imagine that, as in the case of racehorses, a prince has certain
   peculiar characteristics that destine him for the throne, just as the
   courser has certain physical qualities which destine him for the
   race-track. But in the case of the noble race of Andalusian steeds,
   certain precautions are taken to insure its genuineness. Surely, in the
   case of princes, except similar precautions are adopted, no matter how
   much they violate the laws of decency, it is impossible to discover
   whether the offspring of a queen is a legitimate prince or a bastard.

   Everything connected with hereditary Royalty bears the mark of infamy or
   folly. Just consider: a person cannot be a mere workman without some sort
   of ability; to be a king all that a man requires is to be born. The story
   told by Montaigne of the dog Barkouf who was appointed governor of a
   province by an Asiatic monarch, excites our amusement. We laugh at the
   folly of the Egyptians, who set up a pebble on a throne and acknowledged
   it as their King. But a pebble or a dog would be less harmful to the
   people who bowed before them than are kings to the nations that pay them
   servile homage.

   An irrational animal or a piece of lifeless rock is less dangerous to a
   nation than a human idol. Hardly a single example can be adduced where a
   man of genius has left behind him children worthy of their parentage. And
   yet the authority vested in a sovereign, must descend to his son! It is
   like saying that a wise father always has a wise son! A good governor by
   inheritance is as likely as a good author by inheritance.

   Common sense, therefore, is as much outraged by the idea of Royalty as
   common right is. Still, it is more than an absurdity; it is a plague,
   because a nation that prostrates itself in presences of an absurdity is
   degraded. Can that people which reveres equally vice and virtue, ignorance
   and wisdom, ever have the capacity for managing important affairs? For
   this reason, it will be noticed that the inhabitants of a monarchical
   country are often intellectually degenerate and are distinguished for
   their servile disposition.

   Another consequence of this baleful institution is that it destroys
   equality and introduces what is called "Nobility." Evil a thing as
   Nobility is, it is less so than government by inheritance. All that the
   noble asks of me is that I recognize his superiority because of his birth,
   while the King requires my submission: I am amused by the noble; I feel
   like setting my foot upon the King.

   It was thought that when the Convention voted the abolition of Royalty,
   someone would speak in its favor. In this relation, a certain philosopher,
   who believed that no decree should be issued without a preliminary
   discussion of the question, moved for the appointment of an orator who
   should bring forward all the arguments that could be adduced in favor of
   Royalty, so that everything that could be said in its justification should
   be made clear to the world. It was on the principle that counsel is
   assigned to the defense, no matter how strong is the evidence of the
   prisoner's guilt. In the Republic of Venice there was an official whose
   function it was to assail all testimony, however indisputable. Royalty,
   however, has plenty of defenders. It is only fitting that we should
   examine the cogency of their arguments.

   1. The people need a King to protect them from the tyranny of the
   powerful.

   Let the Rights of Man be established, Equality enthroned, a sound
   Constitution drafted, with its powers clearly defined; let all privileges,
   distinctions of birth and monopolies be annulled; establish liberty of
   trade and industry, the freedom of the press, equal division of family
   inheritances, publicity of all government measures, and you will be
   certain to have excellent laws, and may dispel from your mind the dread of
   the powerful; for, whether they like it or not, all citizens will then be
   subject to the law.

   2. A King will prevent the Legislature from usurping authority.

   If representatives, who cannot act as administrators or judges, are often
   renewed, if their functions are determined by law, if the people can
   summon at any moment their national conventions and primary assemblies,
   the tyranny of a legislature would have only a very short existence,
   especially among a people capable of self-defense, who can read, and have
   newspapers, guns and pikes. Why assume an evil solely for the purpose of
   providing a remedy?

   3. To strengthen the executive power, we should have a King.

   Such a proposition might have a certain force when we had nobles, priests,
   parliaments, and other privileged classes. Now, however, the law is all
   powerful, and as it is the expression of the general will, it is the
   interest of everyone to see that it is executed. On the contrary, the
   presence of a hereditary king tends to weaken the executive power, as was
   clearly demonstrated recently when we attempted to unite Royalty and
   Liberty in marriage bonds.

   For that matter, those who hold this opinion are persons who identify the
   king with the Executive Power. My readers, I fancy, entertain more
   enlightened sentiments.

    The following is another not uncommon fallacy: "We must have either an
   hereditary chief or an elective chief. If we have an elective chief, the
   citizens will quarrel about the candidates, and every election will be
   followed by a civil war." In the first place, such civil wars as have
   arisen in England and France were the result, not of election, but of
   hereditary succession; and, in addition, the scourge of foreign war has,
   for a score of times, devastated these kingdoms, because of the claims
   asserted by certain royal families. In fine, all the disturbances that
   occurred during the Regency had their source in hereditary succession.

   The great point, however, to be considered is this: an elective chief will
   not be followed by a train of courtiers, will not be surrounded with royal
   pageantry, will not be puffed up with servile adulation, and will not have
   an income of thirty millions; and besides, his fellow-citizens will not
   elect him to an office of several years' duration without limiting his
   authority and keeping his income within due bounds.

   Moreover, the presence of a king entails the presence of an aristocracy
   and of taxation reaching thirty millions. This is doubtless why Franklin
   styled Royalism a crime as bad as poisoning.

   The sole reason why Royalty, with all its visionary splendor, its assumed
   necessity, the superstitious idolatry that follows in its train, was
   created was for the purpose of exacting from its victims excessive
   taxation and willing submission.

   Royalty and Popery have had the same goal to attain and have been
   supported by the same deceptions; they are now falling into the same decay
   under the rays of the same Light.
