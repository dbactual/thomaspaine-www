   To Citizen President  Spring 1797

   No. 4 Rue du theatre francais, 24 Germinal 6 year

   CITIZEN PRESIDENT:

   In a letter to the Director Revelliere le Peaux a few days past, I
   mentioned that I had reasons for believing that the orders of the
   Directory were made a trade of. I am now assured of the fact. The Citizen
   Connolly born in Ireland, but who has lived more than 32 years in America,
   and served as Captain and Major in the American Revolution, is one of the
   persons from whom money has been extorted. He went from Paris to Havre, on
   his commercial affairs, was put in arrestation, taken to prison, and
   liberated for 4800 livres (200 louis d'ors). They asked 15, or 16,000
   livres. The duty I owe to justice and to friendship makes it incumbent on
   me to state this case to the Directory. Connolly lives at the Coffee
   Boston Rue Vivienne, and I am told that the Secretary of the Judge du Paix
   is now in Paris. I do not send the written account which Connelly has
   given to me, because the Directory can order that his deposition be taken.

   Salut et respect

   THOMAS PAINE.
