   To Joel Barlow  May 4, 1807

   NEW YORK,

   DEAR SIR:

   I have prosecuted the Board of Inspectors for disfranchising me. You and
   other Americans in Paris went in a body to the Convention to reclaim me,
   and I want a certificate from you, properly attested, of this fact. If you
   consult with Gov. Clinton he will in friendship inform you who to address
   it to.

   Having now done with business I come to meums and tuums. What are you
   about? You sometimes hear of me but I never hear of you. It seems as if I
   had got to be master of the feds and the priests. The former do not attack
   my political publications; they rather try to keep them out of sight by
   silence. And as to the priests, they act as if they would say, let us
   alone and we will let you alone. My examination of the passages called
   prophecies is printed, and will be published next week. I have prepared it
   with the Essay on Dream. I do not believe that the priests will attack it,
   for it is not a book of opinions but of facts. Had the Christian Religion
   done any good in the world I would not have exposed it, however fabulous I
   might believe it to be. But the delusive idea of having a friend at court
   whom they call a redeemer, who pays all their scores, is an encouragement
   to wickedness.

   What is Fulton about? Is he taming a whale to draw his submarine boat? I
   wish you would desire Mr. Smith to send me his country National
   Intelligencer. It is printed twice a week without advertisement. I am
   somewhat at a loss of want of authentic intelligence.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.
