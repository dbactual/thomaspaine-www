   To Thomas Jefferson  September 28, 1790

   London Sepr. 28th 1790
   
   Dear Sir

   I enclose you a few observations on the establishment of a Mint - I have
   not seen your report on that subject and therefore cannot see how
   nearly our opinions run together, but as it is by thinking upon and
   talking subjects over that we approach towards truth there may probably be
   something in the enclosed that may be of use -

   As the establishment of a Mint combines a portion of Politics with a
   knowledge of the Arts and a variety of other matters it is a subject I
   shall very much like to talk with you upon.

   I intend at all events to be in America in the Spring and it will please
   me much to arrive before you have gone this the arrangement.

   I am D. Sir with much esteem your ot. Hble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   As I do not know by what means this will arrive, or when it will go - I put
   nothing in it but the subject I write upon -
