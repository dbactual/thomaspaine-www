   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.

   New York May 3, 1807

   Sir

   When Mr. Monro came Minister from the United States to the french
   Government I was still imprisoned in the Luxemburg by the Robespierre
   party in the Convention. The fall of Robespierre took place a few days
   before Mr. Monro reached Paris, and as soon as Mr. Monro could make his
   own standing good, which required time on account of the ill conduct of
   his predecessor Gouverneur Morris, he reclaimed me as an American Citizen,
   for the case was, I was excluded from the Convention as a foreigner and
   imprisoned as a foreigner. I was liberated immediately on Mr. Monro's
   reclamation.

   Mr. Monroe wrote an official account of this to the Secretary of State,
   Mr. Randolph, and also an account of what he had done for Madame la Fayette
   who was also imprisoned, distinguishing the one to be done officially, and
   the other, that for Madame la Fayette, to be done in friendship. In Mr.
   Randolph's official answer to Mr. Monro's letter, he says as nearly as I
   recollect the words, "The President (Washington) approves what you
   have done in the case of Mr. Paine." &mdash; My own opinion on this matter is,
   that as I had not been guillotined Washington thought it best to say what
   he did.

   I will be obliged to you for an attested copy of Mr. Monro's letter and
   also of Mr. Randolph's official answer so far as any parts of them relate
   to me. The reason for this application is as follows,

   Last year 1806 I lived on my farm at New Rochelle, State of New York; A
   man of the name Elisha Ward was supervisor that year. The father of this
   man and all his brothers joined the british in the war; but this one being
   the youngest and not at that time old enough to carry a musket remained at
   home with his mother.

   When the election (at which the supervisor for the time being presides)
   came on at New Rochelle last year for Members of Congress and Members of
   the State assembly, I tendered my tickets separately distinguishing which
   was which as is the custom; each of which Ward refused, saying to me "*You
   are not an American Citizen.*" Upon my beginning to remonstrate with him,
   he replied, "Our Minister at Paris, Gouverneur Morris, would not reclaim
   you as an American Citizen when you were imprisoned in The Luxemburg at
   Paris, and General Washington refused to do it." Upon my telling him that the two 
   cases he stated were falsehoods and that if he did me injustice I would prosecute 
   him, he got up and calling out for a constable said, "I commit this man to prison." 
   He chose however to sit down and go no further with it.

   I accordingly commenced a prosecution against him last fall and the court
   will set the 20th of this May. Mr. Monro's letter to the secretary and
   the secretary's official answer are both published by Mr. Monro in his
   view of the conduct of the executive printed by Benjn Franklin Bache. But
   as a printed book is not sufficient evidence an attested copy from your
   office will be necessary.

   As to Gouverneur Morris, the fact is, that he did reclaim me on my
   application to him as Minister, but his reclamation of me did me no good,
   for he could hardly keep himself out of prison, neither did he do it out
   of any good will to me. Joel Barlow and other Americans in Paris had been in a 
   body to the Convention to reclaim me but their reclamation being unofficial was not 
   regarded. I then applied to Morris, but I know not what he wrote to the french 
   Minister, whatever it was he concealed it from me.

   Yours in friendship
   
   Thomas Paine
