   To the Right Honorable the Marquis of Lansdowne  Sept. 21, 1787

   THETFORD, NORFOLK,

   The Abbe Morellet your Lordship's very good friend and mine, desired me,
   on my leaving Paris to present you his respects. I am sorry I have not an
   opportunity of delivering them personally, with such other matters as
   arise in conversation between the Abbe and myself.

   But I request your Lordship to be assured that independent of any
   commission of compliments from any person whatever, I should have been
   impelled by the respect I bear to the abilities and principles your
   Lordship showed in opposing the American war to have waited on you to
   express my thanks. I have not the honor of being personally known to you,
   but the signature I have used, Common Sense, will I presume bring my name
   and character to your recollection.

   I must regret your Lordship's absence from Town. There are matters I
   should have been very happy in hearing your opinion upon, for to a man who
   considers the world as his home, and the good of it in all places as his
   object, I have long banished the contracted ideas, I was, like other
   people, brought up in. With respect to France I am certain the English
   entertain very wrong ideas. The people of that country are a different
   kind of people to what they have been represented here, and as it is the
   true interest of the two countries to agree and trade, instead of fight,
   with each other, I hope the time is not far distant when they will
   mutually see their true interest.

   I am not unacquainted that your Lordship possesses more liberal principles
   on this head than are to be found in some of your contemporaries, but time
   and reason will effect great things, especially if a few good men in both
   countries will make a beginning.

   Here is a clamor of war which nobody understands. There appears no object
   to the bulk of the people either to justify the measure or answer the
   expense. I joined in the defense of America, on the ground that a country
   invaded is in the condition of a house broke into, and on no other
   principle than this, can a reflective mind at least such as mine, justify
   war to itself. It is a matter worth considering that while the English
   boast of the freedom of their government, that government is the oppressor
   of freedom in all other countries, and France its protectress.

   A war in Europe that would involve England would be a pecuniary advantage
   to America. She would be the neutral flag and the trade would go into her
   hands, therefore in wishing peace to Europe my principles operate over my
   interest, for America is the country where my heart, and what property I
   have lie, and to which I shall return.

   I am at present on a visit to some relatives and friends here. I shall
   return in about a week to London. If your Lordship should find leisure to
   favor me with a line it will be a pleasure to me to receive it. Mr. Palmer
   Controller General of the Post Office whom I saw in Paris with Lord Wycomb
   will take charge of any letters for me, and should it happen that I should
   return to Paris, on my way to America without the honor of seeing your
   Lordship, I request you to accept my thanks, and wishes for health and
   happiness.

   I am Your Lordship's Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
