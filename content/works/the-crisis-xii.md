   Crisis XII

    

   Foner's introduction:

   In September 1782, Americans learned that the new Shelburne ministry was
   opposed to granting independence, believing that the two countries could
   still be united. Paine wrote his new Crisis to disillusion the Earl of
   Shelburne who had become Prime Minister after Rockingham had died.

   Paine came to know Shelburne well when he was in England after the war. In
   a letter to Thomas Jefferson, March 12, 1789, Paine writes: "I believe I
   am not so much in the good graces of the Marquis of Lansdowne as I used to
   be-I do not answer his purpose. He was always talking of a sort of
   reconnection of England and America, and my coldness and reserve on this
   subject checked communication."

   TO THE EARL OF SHELBURNE

   MY LORD,- A speech, which has been printed in several of the British and
   New York newspapers, as coming from your lordship, in answer to one from
   the Duke of Richmond, of the 10th of July last, contains expressions and
   opinions so new and singular, and so enveloped in mysterious reasoning,
   that I address this publication to you, for the purpose of giving them a
   free and candid examination. The speech I allude to is in these words:

   "His lordship said, it had been mentioned in another place, that he had
   been guilty of inconsistency. To clear himself of this, he asserted that
   he still held the same principles in respect to American independence
   which he at first imbibed. He had been, and yet was of opinion, whenever
   the Parliament of Great Britain acknowledges that point, the sun of
   England's glory is set forever. Such were the sentiments he possessed on a
   former day, and such the sentiments he continued to hold at this hour. It
   was the opinion of Lord Chatham, as well as many other able statesmen.
   Other noble lords, however, think differently, and as the majority of the
   cabinet support them, he acquiesced in the measure, dissenting from the
   idea; and the point is settled for bringing the matter into the full
   discussion of Parliament, where it will be candidly, fairly, and
   impartially debated. The independence of America would end in the ruin of
   England; and that a peace patched up with France, would give that proud
   enemy the means of yet trampling on this country. The sun of England's
   glory he wished not to see set forever; he looked for a spark at least to
   be left, which might in time light us up to a new day. But if independence
   was to be granted, if Parliament deemed that measure prudent, he foresaw,
   in his own mind, that England was undone. He wished to God that he had
   been deputed to Congress, that be might plead the cause of that country as
   well as of this, and that he might exercise whatever powers he possessed
   as an orator, to save both from ruin, in a conviction to Congress, that,
   if their independence was signed, their liberties were gone forever.

   "Peace, his lordship added, was a desirable object, but it must be an
   honorable peace, and not an humiliating one, dictated by France, or
   insisted on by America. It was very true, that this kingdom was not in a
   flourishing state, it was impoverished by war. But if we were not rich, it
   was evident that France was poor. If we were straitened in our finances,
   the enemy were exhausted in their resources. This was a great empire; it
   abounded with brave men, who were able and willing to fight in a common
   cause; the language of humiliation should not, therefore, be the language
   of Great Britain. His lordship said, that he was not afraid nor ashamed of
   those expressions going to America. There were numbers, great numbers
   there, who were of the same way of thinking, in respect to that country
   being dependent on this, and who, with his lordship, perceived ruin and
   independence linked together."

   Thus far the speech; on which I remark- That his lordship is a total
   stranger to the mind and sentiments of America; that he has wrapped
   himself up in fond delusion, that something less than independence, may,
   under his administration, be accepted; and he wishes himself sent to
   Congress, to prove the most extraordinary of all doctrines, which is, that
   independence, the sublimest of all human conditions, is loss of liberty.

   In answer to which we may say, that in order to know what the contrary
   word dependence means, we have only to look back to those years of severe
   humiliation, when the mildest of all petitions could obtain no other
   notice than the haughtiest of all insults; and when the base terms of
   unconditional submission were demanded, or undistinguishable destruction
   threatened. It is nothing to us that the ministry have been changed, for
   they may be changed again. The guilt of a government is the crime of a
   whole country; and the nation that can, though but for a moment, think and
   act as England has done, can never afterwards be believed or trusted.
   There are cases in which it is as impossible to restore character to life,
   as it is to recover the dead. It is a phoenix that can expire but once,
   and from whose ashes there is no resurrection. Some offences are of such a
   slight composition, that they reach no further than the temper, and are
   created or cured by a thought. But the sin of England has struck the heart
   of America, and nature has not left in our power to say we can forgive.

   Your lordship wishes for an opportunity to plead before Congress the cause
   of England and America, and to save, as you say, both from ruin.

   That the country, which, for more than seven years has sought our
   destruction, should now cringe to solicit our protection, is adding the
   wretchedness of disgrace to the misery of disappointment; and if England
   has the least spark of supposed honor left, that spark must be darkened by
   asking, and extinguished by receiving, the smallest favor from America;
   for the criminal who owes his life to the grace and mercy of the injured,
   is more executed by living, than he who dies.

   But a thousand pleadings, even from your lordship, can have no effect.
   Honor, interest, and every sensation of the heart, would plead against
   you. We are a people who think not as you think; and what is equally true,
   you cannot feel as we feel. The situations of the two countries are
   exceedingly different. Ours has been the seat of war; yours has seen
   nothing of it. The most wanton destruction has been committed in our
   sight; the most insolent barbarity has been acted on our feelings. We can
   look round and see the remains of burnt and destroyed houses, once the
   fair fruit of hard industry, and now the striking monuments of British
   brutality. We walk over the dead whom we loved, in every part of America,
   and remember by whom they fell. There is scarcely a village but brings to
   life some melancholy thought, and reminds us of what we have suffered, and
   of those we have lost by the inhumanity of Britain. A thousand images
   arise to us, which, from situation, you cannot see, and are accompanied by
   as many ideas which you cannot know; and therefore your supposed system of
   reasoning would apply to nothing, and all your expectations die of
   themselves.

   The question whether England shall accede to the independence of America,
   and which your lordship says is to undergo a parliamentary discussion, is
   so very simple, and composed of so few cases, that it scarcely needs a
   debate.

   It is the only way out of an expensive and ruinous war, which has no
   object, and without which acknowledgment there can be no peace.

   But your lordship says, the sun of Great Britain will set whenever she
   acknowledges the independence of America.- Whereas the metaphor would have
   been strictly just, to have left the sun wholly out of the figure, and
   have ascribed her not acknowledging it to the influence of the moon.

   But the expression, if true, is the greatest confession of disgrace that
   could be made, and furnishes America with the highest notions of sovereign
   independent importance. Mr. Wedderburne, about the year 1776, made use of
   an idea of much the same kind,- Relinquish America! says he- What is it
   but to desire a giant to shrink spontaneously into a dwarf.

   Alas! are those people who call themselves Englishmen, of so little
   internal consequence, that when America is gone, or shuts her eyes upon
   them, their sun is set, they can shine no more, but grope about in
   obscurity, and contract into insignificant animals? Was America, then, the
   giant of the empire, and England only her dwarf in waiting! Is the case so
   strangely altered, that those who once thought we could not live without
   them, are now brought to declare that they cannot exist without us? Will
   they tell to the world, and that from their first minister of state, that
   America is their all in all; that it is by her importance only that they
   can live, and breathe, and have a being? Will they, who long since
   threatened to bring us to their feet, bow themselves to ours, and own that
   without us they are not a nation? Are they become so unqualified to debate
   on independence, that they have lost all idea of it themselves, and are
   calling to the rocks and mountains of America to cover their
   insignificance? Or, if America is lost, is it manly to sob over it like a
   child for its rattle, and invite the laughter of the world by declarations
   of disgrace? Surely, a more consistent line of conduct would be to bear it
   without complaint; and to show that England, without America, can preserve
   her independence, and a suitable rank with other European powers. You were
   not contented while you had her, and to weep for her now is childish.

   But Lord Shelburne thinks something may yet be done. What that something
   is, or how it is to be accomplished, is a matter in obscurity. By arms
   there is no hope. The experience of nearly eight years, with the expense
   of an hundred million pounds sterling, and the loss of two armies, must
   positively decide that point. Besides, the British have lost their
   interest in America with the disaffected. Every part of it has been tried.
   There is no new scene left for delusion: and the thousands who have been
   ruined by adhering to them, and have now to quit the settlements which
   they had acquired, and be conveyed like transports to cultivate the
   deserts of Augustine and Nova Scotia, has put an end to all further
   expectations of aid.

   If you cast your eyes on the people of England, what have they to console
   themselves with for the millions expended? Or, what encouragement is there
   left to continue throwing good money after bad? America can carry on the
   war for ten years longer, and all the charges of government included, for
   less than you can defray the charges of war and government for one year.
   And I, who know both countries, know well, that the people of America can
   afford to pay their share of the expense much better than the people of
   England can. Besides, it is their own estates and property, their own
   rights, liberties and government, that they are defending; and were they
   not to do it, they would deserve to lose all, and none would pity them.
   The fault would be their own, and their punishment just.

   The British army in America care not how long the war lasts. They enjoy an
   easy and indolent life. They fatten on the folly of one country and the
   spoils of another; and, between their plunder and their prey, may go home
   rich. But the case is very different with the laboring farmer, the working
   tradesman, and the necessitous poor in England, the sweat of whose brow
   goes day after day to feed, in prodigality and sloth, the army that is
   robbing both them and us. Removed from the eye of that country that
   supports them, and distant from the government that employs them, they cut
   and carve for themselves, and there is none to call them to account.

   But England will be ruined, says Lord Shelburne, if America is
   independent.

   Then I say, is England already ruined, for America is already independent:
   and if Lord Shelburne will not allow this, he immediately denies the fact
   which he infers. Besides, to make England the mere creature of America, is
   paying too great a compliment to us, and too little to himself.

   But the declaration is a rhapsody of inconsistency. For to say, as Lord
   Shelburne has numberless times said, that the war against America is
   ruinous, and yet to continue the prosecution of that ruinous war for the
   purpose of avoiding ruin, is a language which cannot be understood.
   Neither is it possible to see how the independence of America is to
   accomplish the ruin of England after the war is over, and yet not affect
   it before. America cannot be more independent of her, nor a greater enemy
   to her, hereafter than she now is; nor can England derive less advantages
   from her than at present: why then is ruin to follow in the best state of
   the case, and not in the worst? And if not in the worst, why is it to
   follow at all?

   That a nation is to be ruined by peace and commerce, and fourteen or
   fifteen millions a-year less expenses than before, is a new doctrine in
   politics. We have heard much clamor of national savings and economy; but
   surely the true economy would be, to save the whole charge of a silly,
   foolish, and headstrong war; because, compared with this, all other
   retrenchments are baubles and trifles.

   But is it possible that Lord Shelburne can be serious in supposing that
   the least advantage can be obtained by arms, or that any advantage can be
   equal to the expense or the danger of attempting it? Will not the capture
   of one army after another satisfy him, must all become prisoners? Must
   England ever be the sport of hope, and the victim of delusion? Sometimes
   our currency was to fail; another time our army was to disband; then whole
   provinces were to revolt. Such a general said this and that; another wrote
   so and so; Lord Chatham was of this opinion; and lord somebody else of
   another. To-day 20,000 Russians and 20 Russian ships of the line were to
   come; to-morrow the empress was abused without mercy or decency. Then the
   Emperor of Germany was to be bribed with a million of money, and the King
   of Prussia was to do wonderful things. At one time it was, Lo here! and
   then it was, Lo there! Sometimes this power, and sometimes that power, was
   to engage in the war, just as if the whole world was mad and foolish like
   Britain. And thus, from year to year, has every straw been catched at, and
   every Will-with-a-wisp led them a new dance.

   This year a still newer folly is to take place. Lord Shelburne wishes to
   be sent to Congress, and he thinks that something may be done.

   Are not the repeated declarations of Congress, and which all America
   supports, that they will not even hear any proposals whatever, until the
   unconditional and unequivocal independence of America is recognised; are
   not, I say, these declarations answer enough?

   But for England to receive any thing from America now, after so many
   insults, injuries and outrages, acted towards us, would show such a spirit
   of meanness in her, that we could not but despise her for accepting it.
   And so far from Lord Shelburne's coming here to solicit it, it would be
   the greatest disgrace we could do them to offer it. England would appear a
   wretch indeed, at this time of day, to ask or owe any thing to the bounty
   of America. Has not the name of Englishman blots enough upon it, without
   inventing more? Even Lucifer would scorn to reign in heaven by permission,
   and yet an Englishman can creep for only an entrance into America. Or, has
   a land of liberty so many charms, that to be a doorkeeper in it is better
   than to be an English minister of state?

   But what can this expected something be? Or, if obtained, what can it
   amount to, but new disgraces, contentions and quarrels? The people of
   America have for years accustomed themselves to think and speak so freely
   and contemptuously of English authority, and the inveteracy is so deeply
   rooted, that a person invested with any authority from that country, and
   attempting to exercise it here, would have the life of a toad under a
   harrow. They would look on him as an interloper, to whom their compassion
   permitted a residence. He would be no more than the Mungo of a farce; and
   if he disliked that, he must set off. It would be a station of
   degradation, debased by our pity, and despised by our pride, and would
   place England in a more contemptible situation than any she has yet been
   in during the war. We have too high an opinion of ourselves, even to think
   of yielding again the least obedience to outlandish authority; and for a
   thousand reasons, England would be the last country in the world to yield
   it to. She has been treacherous, and we know it. Her character is gone,
   and we have seen the funeral.

   Surely she loves to fish in troubled waters, and drink the cup of
   contention, or she would not now think of mingling her affairs with those
   of America. It would be like a foolish dotard taking to his arms the bride
   that despises him, or who has placed on his head the ensigns of her
   disgust. It is kissing the hand that boxes his ears, and proposing to
   renew the exchange. The thought is as servile as the war is wicked, and
   shows the last scene of the drama to be as inconsistent as the first.

   As America is gone, the only act of manhood is to let her go. Your
   lordship had no hand in the separation, and you will gain no honor by
   temporising politics. Besides, there is something so exceedingly
   whimsical, unsteady, and even insincere in the present conduct of England,
   that she exhibits herself in the most dishonorable colors. On the second
   of August last, General Carleton and Admiral Digby wrote to General
   Washington in these words:

   "The resolution of the House of Commons, of the 27th of February last, has
   been placed in Your Excellency's hands, and intimations given at the same
   time that further pacific measures were likely to follow. Since which,
   until the present time, we have had no direct communications with England;
   but a mail is now arrived, which brings us very important information. We
   are acquainted, sir, by authority, that negotiations for a general peace
   have already commenced at Paris, and that Mr. Grenville is invested with
   full powers to treat with all the parties at war, and is now at Paris in
   execution of his commission. And we are further, sir, made acquainted,
   that His Majesty, in order to remove any obstacles to this peace which he
   so ardently wishes to restore, has commanded his ministers to direct Mr.
   Grenville, that the independence of the Thirteen United Provinces, should
   be proposed by him in the first instance, instead of making it a condition
   of a general treaty."

   Now, taking your present measures into view, and comparing them with the
   declaration in this letter, pray what is the word of your king, or his
   ministers, or the Parliament, good for? Must we not look upon you as a
   confederated body of faithless, treacherous men, whose assurances are
   fraud, and their language deceit? What opinion can we possibly form of
   you, but that you are a lost, abandoned, profligate nation, who sport even
   with your own character, and are to be held by nothing but the bayonet or
   the halter?

   To say, after this, that the sun of Great Britain will be set whenever she
   acknowledges the independence of America, when the not doing it is the
   unqualified lie of government, can be no other than the language of
   ridicule, the jargon of inconsistency. There were thousands in America who
   predicted the delusion, and looked upon it as a trick of treachery, to
   take us from our guard, and draw off our attention from the only system of
   finance, by which we can be called, or deserve to be called, a sovereign,
   independent people. The fraud, on your part, might be worth attempting,
   but the sacrifice to obtain it is too high.

   There are others who credited the assurance, because they thought it
   impossible that men who had their characters to establish, would begin
   with a lie. The prosecution of the war by the former ministry was savage
   and horrid; since which it has been mean, trickish, and delusive. The one
   went greedily into the passion of revenge, the other into the subtleties
   of low contrivance; till, between the crimes of both, there is scarcely
   left a man in America, be he Whig or Tory, who does not despise or detest
   the conduct of Britain.

   The management of Lord Shelburne, whatever may be his views, is a caution
   to us, and must be to the world, never to regard British assurances. A
   perfidy so notorious cannot be hid. It stands even in the public papers of
   New York, with the names of Carleton and Digby affixed to it. It is a
   proclamation that the king of England is not to be believed; that the
   spirit of lying is the governing principle of the ministry. It is holding
   up the character of the House of Commons to public infamy, and warning all
   men not to credit them. Such are the consequences which Lord Shelburne's
   management has brought upon his country.

   After the authorized declarations contained in Carleton and Digby's
   letter, you ought, from every motive of honor, policy and prudence, to
   have fulfilled them, whatever might have been the event. It was the least
   atonement that you could possibly make to America, and the greatest
   kindness you could do to yourselves; for you will save millions by a
   general peace, and you will lose as many by continuing the war.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29, 1782.

   P. S. The manuscript copy of this letter is sent your lordship, by the way
   of our head-quarters, to New York, inclosing a late pamphlet of mine,
   addressed to the Abbe Raynal, which will serve to give your lordship some
   idea of the principles and sentiments of America.

   C. S.
