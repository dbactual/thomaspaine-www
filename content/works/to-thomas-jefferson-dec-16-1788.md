   To Thomas Jefferson December 16, 1788

   LONDON,

   DEAR SIR :

   I write you by Mr. Quesnay. I also wrote you a long letter of (I believe)
   14 or 16 pages enclosing a Philadelphia Newspaper with the account of the
   Procession on the 4th of July. I requested Mr. Bartholemy to enclose it in
   his dispatches which he promised me to do. This is about ten weeks ago. I
   was then setting off to the Iron Works in Yorkshire to execute a small
   bridge. The work goes on with great success and in appearance exceeds both
   the model and the drawing. I come from thence about a fortnight ago, but
   shall return again.

   That the King is insane is now old news. He yet continues in the same
   state, and the Parliament are on the business of appointing a Regent. The
   Dukes of York and Gloucester have both made speeches in the House of
   Peers. An embarrassing question, whether the Prince of Wales has a right
   in himself by succession during the incapacity of his father, or whether
   the right must derive through Parliament, has been agitated in both
   Houses, [illegible] and the speeches of York and Gloucester of avoiding
   the question. This day (Tuesday) is fixed for bringing the matter on in
   the House of Commons. A change of Ministry is expected, and I believe
   determined on. The Duke of Portland and his friends will in all
   probability come in.

   I shall be exceedingly glad to hear from you, and to know if you have
   received my letters, and also when you intend setting off for America, or
   whether you intend to visit England before you go. In case of change of
   Ministry here there are certain matters I shall be glad to see you upon.
   Remember me to the Marquis de Lafayette. We hear good things from France,
   and I sincerely wish them all well and happy.

   Your affectionate friend and obedient humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. Remember me to Mr. Short and Mr. Mazzei.
