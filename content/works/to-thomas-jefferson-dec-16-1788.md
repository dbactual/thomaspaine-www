   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.
   
   London Dec.16 1788

   Dear Sir

   I write you by Mr. Quesney &mdash; I also wrote you a long letter of 
   (I believe) 14 or 16 pages enclosing a Philadelphia News paper 
   with the account of the Procession on the 4th of July. I requested Mr. 
   Bartholemy to enclose it in his dispatches which he promised me to 
   do &mdash; This is about ten weeks ago. I
   was then setting off to the Iron Works in Yorkshire to execute a small
   Bridge. The work goes on with great success and in appearance exceeds both
   the model and the drawing. I come from thence about a fortnight ago, but
   shall return again.

   That the King is insane is now old news &mdash; He yet continues in the same
   state, and the Parliament are on the business of appointing a Regent. The
   Dukes of York and Gloucester have both made speeches in the house of
   Peers &mdash; an Embarrassing Question whether the Prince of Wales 
   has a right in himself by succession during the incapacity of his 
   father &mdash; or whether the right must derive thro' Parliament, 
   has been agitated in both Houses, and the speeches of York & 
   Gloucester of avoiding
   the Question. This day (tuesday) is fixt for bringing the matter on in
   the house of Commons &mdash; A change of Ministry is expected and, I believe, 
   determined on. The Duke of Portland and his friends will in all
   probability come in.

   I shall be exceedingly glad to hear from you, and to know if you have
   received my letters, and also, when you intend setting off for America or
   whether you intend to visit England before you go. In case of a change of
   Ministry here there are certain matters I shall be glad to see you upon.
   Remember me to the Marquis de la Fayette and all my good french. We hear 
   good tidings from France, and I sincerely wish them all well and happy.

   Your affectionate friend and obedient Humble servant

   THOMAS PAINE

   Remember me to Mr. Short & Mr. Mazzei.
   
   Please to direct to me at Mr Whitefall's Merchant No. 13 Broad
