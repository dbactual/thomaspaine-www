   Amboy,

   DEAR SIR:

   There is a report of a French fleet gone at the River St. Lawrence, on
   which I remark, that should the French possess themselves of Canada, they
   will claim according to the extension made by the British Crown. Query.
   Ought not the Congress to make a reclaim from the British Crown while
   Canada remains under that government, otherwise the claim will be made
   from the French, whereas it ought to be made from the English.

   Yours with great respect, T. PAIN[E]

   A great number has deserted-yet I hope we shall do well at last. The 26.
   batallion of Philadelphia Associators march'd this morning for New York,
   except Capt. Weeds (not Wade's) Company who run away to a man.
