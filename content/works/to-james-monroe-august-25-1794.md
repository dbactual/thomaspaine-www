   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Luxembourg - Ther. 2d

   My Dear Sir

   Having nothing to do but to sit and think I will write to pass away time,
   and to say that I am still here. I have received two notes from Msr.
   Beresford which are encouraging (as the generality of notes and letters
   are that arrive to persons here) are, but they contain nothing explicit or
   decisive with respect to my liberation, and *I shall be very glad to
   receive a line from yourself to inform me in what condition the matter
   stands* - If I only glide out of prison by a sort of accident America gains
   no credit by my liberation, neither can my attachment to her be increased
   by such a circumstance. She has had the services of my best days, she has
   my allegiance, she receives my portion of Taxes for my house in Bordentown
   and my farm at New Rochelle, and she owes me protection both at home and
   through her Ministers abroad, yet I remain in prison, in the face of her
   Minister, at the arbitrary will of a Committee

   Excluded as I am from the knowledge of every thing and left to a random of
   Ideas, I know not what to think or how to act. Before there was any
   Minister here (for I consider Morris as none) and while the Robespierrian
   faction lasted, I had nothing to do but to keep my mind tranquil and
   expect the fate that was every day inflicted upon my comrades, not
   individually but by scores. Many a man whom I have passed an hour with in
   Conversation I have seen marching to his destruction the next hour, or
   heard of it the next morning - for what rendered the scene the more horrible
   was that they were generally taken away at Midnight, so that every man
   went to bed with the apprehension of never seeing his friends or the world
   again.

   I wish to impress it upon you that all the changes that have taken place in
   Paris have been sudden. There is now a Moment of Calm, but if thro' any
   over complaisance to the persons you converse with on the subject of my
   liberation, you omit procuring it for me *now*, you may have to lament the
   fate of your friend when its too late - The loss of a Battle to the
   Northward or other possible accident may happen to bring this about - I am
   not out of danger till I am out of Prison.

   Yours affectionately,

   THOMAS PAINE

   I am now entirely without money. The Convention owes me 1800 livres
   salary which I know not how to get while I am here, nor do I know how to
   draw for money on the Rent of my farm in America. It is under the care of
   my good friend General Lewis Morris - I have received no rent since I have
   been in Europe &mdash;
