TPNHA Editor's Note: 
------
TPNHA has determined from our work in the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies' 
Text Analysis Project that this is probably not written by Paine. We include 
it here because it was referenced in the past as Paine's work, so that you may 
have access to it.


   Foner's Introduction:

   Paine frequently argued that the "established principle of the Quakers not
   to shed blood" was a good one and if "universally established, arms and
   the art of war would be wholly extirpated." But he was no pacifist, for he
   understood that liberty could not be defended by words alone. In this
   essay, published in the Pennsylvania Magazine of July, 1775, he shows why
   a "Lover of Peace" should be willing to take up his musket in defense of
   American freedom. The second paragraph has special significance today. It
   is interesting to note his statement that he "would gladly agree with all 
   the world to lay aside the use of arms, and settle matters by negotiation; 
   but unless he whole will, the matter ends, and I take up my musket and 
   thank heaven he has put it in my power." He did more than write about 
   shouldering a gun, for he enlisted in the Continental army immediately 
   after the outbreak of the War for Independence.

   *****************

   Could the peaceable principle of the Quakers be universally established,
   arms and the art of war would be wholly extirpated: But we live not in a
   world of angels. The reign of Satan is not ended; neither are we to expect
   to be defended by miracles. The pillar of the cloud existed only in the
   wilderness. In the nonage of the Israelites. It protected them in the
   retreat from Pharaoh, while they were destitute of the natural means of
   defence, for they brought no arms from Egypt; but it neither fought their
   battles nor shielded them from dangers afterwards. I am thus far a Quaker,
   that I would gladly agree with all the world to lay aside the use of arms,
   and settle matters by negotiation: but unless the whole will, the matter
   ends, and I take up my musket and thank heaven he has put it in my power. 

   Whoever considers the unprincipled enemy we have to cope with, will not
   hesitate to declare that nothing but arms or miracles can reduce them to
   reason and moderation. They have lost sight of the limits of humanity. the
   portrait of a parent red with the blood of her children is a picture fit
   only for the galleries of the infernals. From the House of Commons the
   troops of Britain have been exhorted to right, not for the defence of the
   natural rights, not to repel the invasion of the insult of enemies; but on
   the vilest of all pretences, gold. 'Ye fight for solid revenue' was
   vociferated in the House. Thus America must suffer because she has
   something to lose. Her crime is property. That which allures the
   Highwayman has allured the ministry under a gentler name. but the position
   laid down by Lord Sandwich, is a clear demonstration of the justice of
   defense arms. The American, quoth this Quixote of modern days, will not
   fight; therefore we will. His Lordship's plan when analized amounts to
   this. these people are either too superstitiously religious, or too
   cowardly for arms; they either cannot or dare not defend; their property
   is open to any one who has the courage to attack them. Send but your
   troops and the prize is ours. Kill a few and take the whole. thus the
   peaceable part of mankind will be continually over-run by the vile and
   abandoned. while they neglect the means of self defence. They supposed
   quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand, arms
   like laws discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe, and
   preserve order in the world as well as property. The balance of power is
   the scale of peace. The same balance would be preserved were all the world
   destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some will not others
   dare not lay them aside. And while a single nation refuses to lay them
   down, it is proper that all should keep them up. Horrid mischief would
   ensue were one half the world deprived of the use of them; for while
   avarice and ambition have a place in the heart of man, the weak will
   become a prey to the strong. The history of every age and nation
   establishes these truths, and facts need but little arguments when they
   prove themselves.

   But there is a point to view this matter in of superior consequence to the
   defence of property; and that point is liberty in all its meanings. In the
   barbarous ages of the world, men in general had no liberty. The strong
   governed the weak at will; 'till the coming of Christ there was no such
   thing as political freedom in any known part of the earth. The Jewish
   kings were in point of government as absolute as the Pharaohs. Men were
   frequently put to death without trial at the will of the Sovereign. The
   Romans held the world in slavery, and were themselves the slaves of their
   emperors. the madman of Macedon governed by caprice and passion, and
   strided as arrogantly over the world as if he had made and people it; and
   it is needles to imagine that other nations at that time were more
   refined. Wherefore political as well as spiritual freedom is the gift of
   God through Christ. The second in the catalogue of blessings; and so
   intimately related, so sympathetically united with the first, that the one
   cannot be wounded without communicating an injury to the other. Political
   liberty is the visible pass which guards the religions. It is the outwork
   by which the church militant is defended, and the attacks of the enemy are
   frequently made through his fortress. The same power which as established
   a restraining Port Bill in the Colonies1, has established a restraining
   Protestant Church Bill in Canada2.

   I had the pleasure and advantage of hearing this matter wisely
   investigated, by a gentleman, in a sermon at one of the battalions of this
   city3; and am fully convinced, that spiritual freedom is the root of
   political liberty.

   First. Because till spiritual freedom was made manifest, political liberty
   did not exist.

   Secondly. Because in proportion that spiritual freedom has been
   manifested, political liberty has encreased.

   Thirdly. whenever the visible church has been oppressed, political freedom
   has suffered with it. Read the history of Mary and the Stuarts. The popish
   world at this day by not knowing the full manifestation of spiritual
   freedom, enjoy but a shadow of political liberty. Though I am unwilling to
   accuse the present government of popish principles, they cannot, I think,
   be clearly acquitted of popish practices: the facility with which they
   perceive the dark and ignorant are governed, in popish nations, will
   always be a temptation to the lovers of arbitrary power to adopt the same
   methods.

   As the union between spiritual freedom and political liberty seems nearly
   inseparable, it is our duty to defend both. And defence in the first
   instance is best. The lives of hundreds of both countries had been
   preserved had America been in arms a year ago. Our enemies have mistaken
   our peace for cowardice, and supposing us unarmed have begun the attack.

   A LOVER OF PEACE

   1.  Paine is referring to the Boston Port Bill, effective June 1, 1774,
   which closed that town's harbor to all shipping until the East India
   Company was reimbursed for the tea dumped into Boston harbor on December
   16, 1773.

   2. The reference is to the Quebec Act of 1774.

   3.  The city is Philadelphia.
