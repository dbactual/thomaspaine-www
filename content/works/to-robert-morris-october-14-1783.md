   To Robert Morris  October 14, 1783

   BORDENTOWN,

   People keep in the habit of wondering why the definitive Treaty and Treaty
   of Commerce do not arrive, just as if foreign Nations would be so foolish
   to pay respect to our Confederated Government when we have set them the
   example of paying so little to it ourselves, for if it has not authority
   enough to regulate a commercial tax, it can- not be important enough for a
   Commercial Treaty, and Britain, finding this out, will regulate our
   carrying Trade by her own act of Parliament.
