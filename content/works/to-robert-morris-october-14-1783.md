   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.

   Borden Town Oct. 14th 1783
   
   Sir

   An attack of the fever has delayed my Journey to Rocky hill, but as it is 
   but of short duration with those who are taken late in the Season, I am in 
   hopes a few days will terminate mine.
   
   I shall be much obliged to you to enclose me an hundred dollars 
   under cover to me at this place, by the Sunday Stage boat and 
   endorse it with the former (thirty pounds) on bal Washington's note.
   
   People keep in the habit of wondering why the definitive Treaty 
   and Treaty of Commerce do not arrive &mdash; just as if foreign 
   Nations would be so foolish to pay respect to our Confederated 
   government when we set them the example of paying so little 
   to it ourselves, for if it has not authority enough to regulate a 
   Commercial Tax, it cannot be important enough for a Commercial 
   Treaty &mdash; and Britain, finding this out, will regulate our Carrying 
   Trade by her own Acts of Parliament.
   
   I am Sir
   
   Your Obt Hmbl Servt
   
   Thomas Paine
