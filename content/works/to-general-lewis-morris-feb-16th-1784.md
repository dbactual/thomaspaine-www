   To General Lewis Morris  February 16th, 1784

   BORDENTOWN,

   DEAR SIR :

   I have been at this place almost three weeks waiting for a change of
   weather to come on to N[ew] York. As no passengers travel by the way of
   Bordentown and South Amboy, the water communication being stopped by the
   ice, we hear very little news from your quarter except the distressing
   account of the want of fire-wood. Valentine is got safe to school again.
   He is the best politician I have seen from N[ew] York for the month past.
   All the information I have had has been from him, and as he very gravely
   accompanies his news with his opinion upon matters I learn quite as much
   from him as I should from, the general run of newspapers. Mr. Ellison is
   lately married, and Valentine tells me (Senator like) that "he very much
   approves Mr. Ellison's choice/' She has the reputation of a prudent
   careful woman and the school will be benefited as to the necessary
   attention to the children's clothes and dress.

   Some time ago I showed Col. G. Morgan at Princeton a letter I received
   from a gentleman at Salisbury in England. He deferred me to leave it with
   him to show to you, which I did. It stated pretty fully the disposition of
   people in the country parts of England to emigrate from that country to
   this, and, as far as I am a judge, opened some useful hints to those who
   have lands either public or private to settle. I have since received a
   duplicate which I intend to show to you in case you have not seen the
   original. I think it is on a subject which deserves attention, for it
   appears to me, as well from my own knowledge of England as from the
   writer's account, that were plans of new settlements laid out with
   conditions annexed, it would not be difficult to procure emigrants with
   money in the hands to settle them.

   Valentine tells me of new Societies at [New] York, some with and some
   without care. As I intend to visit you in a little time I hope you will
   give me chance of partaking of your new amusements. I have had my share of
   care and wish to get rid of some of it. But there is one kind of Society
   which for the sake of public as well as private advantage and reputation I
   wish to see promoted and patronized in your State, and that is, a
   Philosophical Society. Pennsylvania with scarcely anybody in it who knows
   anything of the matter, except Mr. Rittenhouse and one or two more, is
   drawing to herself laurels and honors she does not deserve. The
   Philosophical Society established in Philadelphia is plausibly styled the
   "American Philosophical Society," and though there has not been a single
   experiment or improvement made by the Society for several years before the
   war nor since, yet the name of the thing has drawn to her the notice of
   the European Philosophical Societies and served to make Philadelphia
   appear in the world as the only seat of science in America, whereas it is
   as little, if not the least so of any in the Union, and owes all its
   reputation in that line to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Rittenhouse.

   An attention to matters of this kind are attended with many advantages.
   The countries the most famous and the most respected of antiquity are
   those which distinguished themselves by promoting and patronizing science,
   and on the contrary those which neglected or discouraged it are
   universally denominated rude and barbarous. The patronage which Britain
   has shown to Arts, Science and Literature has given her a better
   established and lasting rank in the world than she ever acquired by her
   arms. And Russia is a modern instance of the effect which the
   encouragement of those things produces both as to the internal improvement
   of a country and the character it raises abroad. The reign of Louis the
   fourteenth is more distinguished by being the Era of science and
   literature in France than by any other circumstance of those days.

   But in the present state of things in America, and especially in New York,
   where the enemy has lately left, and minds of people are discomposed, it
   would be exceeding good policy to draw their attention to objects of
   public and agreeable utility, and to introduce as many subjects of easy
   and popular conversation as possible. And therefore a Philosophical
   Society as one of the means to this end would be a useful institution. The
   more the mind of the country can be taken off from party the quieter the
   seat of government will be; for it is impossible for a less party to
   govern a greater for any considerable length of time unless it can find
   out means to keep the latter in moderate temper, because if reason and
   good management do not prevail on the governing side, the numbers in
   opposition will, in the end, prevail against it. The hot-headed whigs of
   Pennsylvania, many of whom had very little merit to boast of, effectually
   worked themselves out by attempting too high a hand. Instead of increasing
   their strength by rendering themselves respectable, they endeavored to
   monopolize the government in order to be formidable, till at last they
   lost what they had. It is the misfortune of some whigs, as well those who
   have merit as those who have none (for there are whigs of all degrees) to
   expect more than can or ought to be done and which if attempted will
   probably undo the government and place it in other hands.

   You see I write to you on any subject that comes across my thoughts. I am
   shut up here by the frost and if my letter is tedious attribute it to my
   want of amusement. The disagreeable party condition of Pennsylvania has
   given me a dislike to it. It is a place neither of science nor society and
   the most country retreat is to me preferable to Philadelphia. As I have
   yet my place of citizenship to fix, I had much rather it were in the State
   of New York than Pennsylvania, and if it can be ordered so, I should like
   to have a residence amongst you in preference to any place I have yet been
   in America. But of this I will converse more freely when I have the
   pleasure of seeing you and the rest of my N[ew] York friends, to whom
   please to present my best wishes. Remember me to Mrs. Morris and family.

   I am Dear Sir, Your humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Valentine and Master Sears are well. Your old friend Button sends as many
   compliments as can be expected from a horse.
