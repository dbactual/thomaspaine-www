   To James Monroe  [1795]

   DEAR SIR: I thank you for your kindness. I have desired Mr. Gilston to
   enquire if there is room at the Hotel where Mr. Barlow lodges. I will be
   obliged to you to remind him of it in case he has not yet done it. The
   plan I had of going to Hartley's is deranged, the project of the printing
   office is fallen through-I believe in want of money. I shall stay here a
   few days longer as I have something in hand I wish to finish before I
   move, but it must be in the course of this decade. I observe in the
   Redacteur of [illegible] that they are building Gun-boats at Brussels.

   THOMAS PAINE.
