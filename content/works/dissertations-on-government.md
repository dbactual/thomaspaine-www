   THE AFFAIRS OF THE BANK; AND PAPER MONEY

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Throughout most of the year 1785 Paine devoted himself to inventions such
   as an iron bridge without piers, and a smokeless candle. Early in 1786,
   however, he returned to the political scene and entered the bitter
   controversy in Pennsylvania over the Bank of North America. This
   institution had been founded in 1781 by Robert Morris to save the nation's
   finances during the blackest period of the Revolution. It was granted a
   charter by both the Continental Congress and the state of Pennsylvania.
   The battle to repeal its charter in Pennsylvania was part of the bigger
   struggle after the Revolutionary War between debtors and creditors, the
   back-country farmers and the wealthy merchants in Philadelphia. The debtor
   classes were bent upon increasing the amount of paper money in
   circulation, and feared that if the Bank of North America would refuse to
   accept the paper money on the same terms as specie, the legislation to
   increase its circulation would be valueless, since the public would have
   no faith in the bills. A cry therefore arose from the back-country
   counties for the repeal of the Bank charter. As soon as the State
   legislature began to consider the proposal for repeal, the supporters of
   the Bank rallied their forces in opposition to the legislation. Several
   pamphlets supporting the Bank were published, but were replete with such
   legal terminology that few people could understand what they were aiming
   to accomplish. This was the situation when on February 18, 1786 there came
   off the press in Philadelphia a clearly-written pamphlet, written by
   Thomas Paine, entitled: Dissertations on Government; the Affairs of the
   Bank; and Paper Money, attacking paper money as a device on the part of
   those creditors who wished to "cheat their creditors," denouncing the
   legislature's assumption of judicial functions, and its general "want of
   moderation, and prudence, of impartiality and equity, of fair and candid
   inquiry and investigation, and of deliberate and unbiased judgment" in
   dealing with the bank's charter.

   The pamphlet created a great stir. The representatives of the back-country
   farmers denounced Paine for deserting the common people, and one publicly
   referred to him as "an unprincipled author, who let his pen out for hire."
   Paine vigorously denied the accusation, and the evidence does not in the
   slightest support the contention that he was bribed by the bank's officers
   to write the pamphlet. Nor does it uphold the argument that Paine was at
   this stage a conservative at heart, and that it was therefore logical for
   him to side with the wealthy creditor classes. (See the introduction by
   Harry H. Clark to Six New Letters of Thomas Paine entitled "Thomas Paine
   the Conservative" for this contention.) Rather it would seem that Paine
   not only took pride in the Bank as the offspring of the institution he had
   helped found in 1780 and to which he contributed his own money, but
   genuinely believed that the Bank's services to the country were of great
   value in the organization of a sounder economic and political life in
   America. Nor should it be overlooked that Paine's views were widely shared
   by the city mechanics in Philadelphia who did not favor the further
   issuance of paper money, fearing its inflationary effects on their living
   standards. Throughout his career up to this point Paine had voiced the
   sentiments of the artisans and mechanics, and it is not surprising that he
   should do so again on this issue. Naturally, this meant allying himself
   with the very men in the State whom he had formerly opposed, but then the
   urban workers had also opposed these men in the past and now were allied
   with them in opposition to paper money and in support of a stronger
   central government. For evidence that many back-country farmers, members
   of the debtor class, also supported Paine's position, see Freeman H. Hart,
   The Valley of Virginia in the American Revolution, Chapel Hill, 1942,
   pp.128-130.

   For an interesting discussion of the history of the entire struggle, see
   Janet Wilson, "The Bank of North America and Pennsylvania Politics,
   1781-1787," Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, vol. LXVI,
   January, 1942, pp. 3-28.

   PREFACE

   I HERE present the public with a new performance. Some parts of it are
   more particularly adapted to the State of Pennsylvania, on the present
   state of its affairs; but there are others which are on a larger scale.
   The time bestowed on this work has not been long, the whole of it being
   written and printed during the short recess of the Assembly.

   As to parties, merely considered as such, I am attached to no particular
   one. There are such things as right and wrong in the world, and so far as
   these are parties against each other, the signature of COMMON SENSE is
   properly employed.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 18, 1786.

    

   DISSERTATIONS ON GOVERNMENT, ETC.

   Every government, let its form be what it may, contains within itself a
   principle common to all, which is that of a sovereign power, or a power
   over which there is no control, and which controls all others; and as it
   is impossible to construct a form of government in which this power does
   not exist, so there must of necessity be a place, if it may be so called,
   for it to exist in.

   In despotic monarchies this power is lodged in a single person, or
   sovereign. His will is law; which he declares, alters or revokes as he
   pleases, without being accountable to any power for so doing. Therefore,
   the only modes of redress, in countries so governed, are by petition or
   insurrection. And this is the reason we so frequently hear of
   insurrections in despotic governments; for as there are but two modes of
   redress, this is one of them.

   Perhaps it may be said that as the united resistance of the people is
   able, by force, to control the will of the sovereign, that therefore the
   controlling power lodges in them; but it must be understood that I am
   speaking of such powers only as are constituent parts of the government,
   not of those powers which are externally applied to resist and overturn
   it.

   In republics, such as those established in America, the sovereign power,
   or the power over which there is no control, and which controls all
   others, remains where nature placed it-in the people; for the people in
   America are the fountain of power. It remains there as a matter of right,
   recognized in the constitutions of the country, and the exercise of it is
   constitutional and legal. This sovereignty is exercised in electing and
   deputing a certain number of persons to represent and act for the whole,
   and who, if they do not act right, may be displaced by the same power that
   placed them there, and others elected and deputed in their stead, and the
   wrong measures of former representatives corrected and brought right by
   this means. Therefore, the republican form and principle leaves no room
   for insurrection, because it provides and establishes a rightful means in
   its stead.

   In countries under a despotic form of government, the exercise of this
   power is an assumption of sovereignty; a wresting it from the person in
   whose hand their form of government has placed it, and the exercise of it
   is there styled rebellion. Therefore the despotic form of government knows
   no intermediate space between being slaves and being rebels.

   I shall in this place offer an observation which, though not immediately
   connected with my subject, is very naturally deduced from it, which is
   that the nature, if I may so call it, of a government over any people, may
   be ascertained from the modes which the people pursue to obtain redress of
   grievances; for like causes will produce like effects. And therefore the
   government which Britain attempted to erect over America could be no other
   than a despotism, because it left to the Americans no other modes of
   redress than those which are left to people under despotic governments,
   petition and resistance: and the Americans, without ever attending to a
   comparison on the case, went into the same steps which such people go
   into, because no other could be pursued: and this similarity of effects
   leads up to, and ascertains the similarity of the causes or governments
   which produced them.

   But to return. The repository where the sovereign power is placed is the
   first criterion of distinction between a country under a despotic form of
   government and a free country. In a country under a despotic government,
   the sovereign is the only free man in it. In a republic, the people,
   retaining the sovereignty themselves, naturally and necessarily retain
   their freedom with it: for wherever the sovereignty is, there must the
   freedom be.

   As the repository where the sovereign power is lodged is the first
   criterion of distinction, so the second is the principles on which it is
   administered.

   A despotic government knows no principle but will. Whatever the sovereign
   wills to do, the government admits him the inherent right, and the
   uncontrolled power of doing. He is restrained by no fixed rule of right
   and wrong, for he makes the right and wrong himself, and as he pleases. If
   he happens (for a miracle may happen) to be a man of consummate wisdom,
   justice and moderation, of a mild affectionate disposition, disposed to
   business, and understanding and promoting the general good, all the
   beneficial purposes of government will be answered under his
   administration, and the people so governed, may, while this is the case,
   be prosperous and easy.

   But as there can be no security that this disposition will last, and this
   administration continue, and still less security that his successor shall
   have the same qualities and pursue the same measures; therefore, no people
   exercising their reason, and understanding their rights, would, of their
   own choice, invest any one man with such a power.

   Neither is it consistent to suppose the knowledge of any one man competent
   to the exercise of such a power. A sovereign of this sort, is brought up
   in such a distant line of life; lives so remote from the people, and from
   a knowledge of everything which relates to their local situations and
   interests, that he can know nothing from experience and observation, and
   all which he does know, he must be told.

   Sovereign power without sovereign knowledge, that is, a full knowledge of
   all the matters over which that power is to be exercised, is a something
   which contradicts itself.

   There is a species of sovereign power in a single person, which is very
   proper when applied to a commander-in-chief over an army, so far as
   relates to the military government of an army, and the condition and
   purpose of an army constitute the reason why it is so. In an army every
   man is of the same profession; that is, he is a soldier, and the
   commander-in-chief is a soldier too; therefore, the knowledge necessary to
   the exercise of the power is within himself. By understanding what a
   soldier is, he comprehends the local situation, interest and duty of every
   man within what may be called the dominion of his command; and, therefore,
   the condition and circumstances of an army make a fitness for the exercise
   of the power.

   The purpose, likewise, or object of an army, is another reason: for this
   power in a commander-in-chief, though exercised over the army, is not
   exercised against it; but is exercised through or over the army against
   the enemy. Therefore, the enemy, and not the people, is the object it is
   directed to. Neither is it exercised over an army for the purpose of
   raising a revenue from it, but to promote its combined interest, condense
   its powers, and give it capacity for action.

   But all these reasons cease when sovereign power is transferred from the
   commander of an army to the commander of a nation, and entirely loses its
   fitness when applied to govern subjects following occupations, as it
   governs soldiers following arms.

   A nation is quite another element, and everything in it differs not only
   from each other, but all of them differ from those of an army. A nation is
   composed of distinct, unconnected individuals, following various trades,
   employments and pursuits; continually meeting, crossing, uniting, opposing
   and separating from each other, as accident, interest and circumstance
   shall direct. An army has but one occupation and but one interest.

   Another very material matter in which an army and a nation differ, is that
   of temper. An army may be said to have but one temper; for however the
   natural temper of the persons composing the army may differ from each
   other, there is a second temper takes place of the first: a temper formed
   by discipline, mutuality of habits, union of objects and pursuits, and the
   style of military manners: but this can never be the case among all the
   individuals of a nation. Therefore, the fitness, arising from those
   circumstances, which disposes an army to the command of a single person,
   and the fitness of a single person for that command, is not to be found
   either in one or the other, when we come to consider them as a sovereign
   and a nation.

   Having already shown what a despotic government is, and how it is
   administered, I now come to show what the administration of a republic is.

   The administration of a republic is supposed to be directed by certain
   fundamental principles of right and justice, from which there cannot,
   because there ought not to, be any deviation; and whenever any deviation
   appears, there is a kind of stepping out of the republican principle, and
   an approach toward the despotic one. This administration is executed by a
   select number of persons, periodically chosen by the people, who act as
   representatives and in behalf of the whole, and who are supposed to enact
   the same laws and to pursue the same line of administration, as the people
   would do were they all assembled together.

   The public good is to be their object. It is therefore necessary to
   understand what public good is.

   Public good is not a term opposed to the good of individuals; on the
   contrary, it is the good of every individual collected. It is the good of
   all, because it is the good of everyone: for as the public body is every
   individual collected, so the public good is the collected good of those
   individuals.

   The foundation-principle of public good is justice, and wherever justice
   is impartially administered, the public good is promoted; for as it is to
   the good of every man that no injustice be done to him, so likewise it is
   to his good that the principle which secures him should not be violated in
   the person of another, because such a violation weakens his security, and
   leaves to chance what ought to be to him a rock to stand on.

   But in order to understand more minutely, how the public good is to be
   promoted, and the manner in which the representatives are to act to
   promote it, we must have recourse to the original or first principles, on
   which the people formed themselves into a republic.

   When a people agree to form themselves into a republic (for the
   word republic means the public good, or the good of the whole, in
   contradistinction to the despotic form, which makes the good of the
   sovereign, or of one man, the only object of the government), when I say,
   they agree to do this, it is to be understood that they mutually resolve
   and pledge themselves to each other, rich and poor alike, to support and
   maintain this rule of equal justice among them. They therefore renounce
   not only the despotic form, but despotic principle, as well of governing
   as of being governed by mere will and power, and substitute in its place a
   government of justice.

   By this mutual compact, the citizens of a republic put it out of their
   power, that is, they renounce, as detestable, the power of exercising, at
   any future time any species of despotism over each other, or doing a thing
   not right in itself, because a majority of them may have strength of
   numbers sufficient to accomplish it.

   In this pledge and compact1 lies the foundation of the republic: and the
   security to the rich and the consolation to the poor is, that what each
   man has is his own; that no despotic sovereign can take it from him, and
   that the common cementing principle which holds all the parts of a
   republic together, secures him likewise from the despotism of numbers: for
   despotism may be more effectually acted by many over a few, than by one
   man over all.

   Therefore, in order to know how far the power of an assembly, or a house
   of representatives can act in administering the affairs of a republic, we
   must examine how far the power of the people extends under the original
   compact they have made with each other; for the power of the
   representatives is in many cases less, but never can be greater than that
   of the people represented; and whatever the people in their mutual,
   original compact have .renounced the power of doing toward, or acting over
   each other, the representatives cannot assume the power to do, because, as
   I have already said, the power of the representatives cannot be greater
   than that of the people they represent.

   In this place it naturally presents itself that the people in their
   original compact of equal justice or first principles of a republic,
   renounced as despotic, detestable and unjust, the assuming a right of
   breaking and violating their engagements, contracts and compacts with, or
   defrauding, imposing or tyrannizing over each other, and therefore the
   representatives cannot make an act to do it for them, and any such kind of
   act would be an attempt to depose not the personal sovereign, but the
   sovereign principle of the republic, and to introduce despotism in its
   stead.

   It may in this place be proper to distinguish between that species of
   sovereignty which is claimed and exercised by despotic monarchs, and that
   sovereignty which the citizens of a republic inherit and retain. The
   sovereignty of a despotic monarch assumes the power of making wrong right,
   or right wrong, as he pleases or as it suits him. The sovereignty in a
   republic is exercised to keep right and wrong in their proper and distinct
   places, and never suffer the one to usurp the place of the other. A
   republic, properly understood, is a sovereignty of justice, in
   contradistinction to a sovereignty of will.

   Our experience in republicanism is yet so slender, that it is much to be
   doubted, whether all our public laws and acts are consistent with, or can
   be justified on, the principles of a republican government.

   We have been so much habited to act in committees at the commencement of
   the dispute, and during the interregnum of government, and in many cases
   since, and to adopt expedients warranted by necessity, and to permit to
   ourselves a discretionary use of power, suited to the spur and exigency of
   the moment, that a man transferred from a committee to a seat in the
   legislature, imperceptibly takes with him the ideas and habits he has been
   accustomed to, and continues to think like a committee-man instead of a
   legislator, and to govern by the spirit rather than by the rule of the
   Constitution and the principles of the Republic.

   Having already stated that the power of the representatives can never
   exceed the power of the people whom they represent, I now proceed to
   examine more particularly, what the power of the representatives is.

   It is, in the first place, the power of acting as legislators in making
   laws-and in the second place, the power of acting in certain cases, as
   agents or negotiators for the commonwealth, for such purposes as the
   circumstances of the commonwealth require.

   A very strange confusion of ideas, dangerous to the credit, stability, and
   the good and honor of the commonwealth, has arisen, by confounding those
   two distinct powers and things together and blending every act of the
   assembly, of whatever kind it may be, under one general name, of Laws of
   the Commonwealth, and thereby creating an opinion (which is truly of the
   despotic kind) that every succeeding assembly has an equal power over
   every transaction, as well as law, done by a former assembly.

   All laws are acts, but all acts are not laws. Many of the acts of the
   assembly are acts of agency or negotiation, that is, they are acts of
   contract and agreement, on the part of the state, with certain persons
   therein mentioned, and for certain purposes therein recited. An act of
   this kind, after it has passed the house, is of the nature of a deed or
   contract, signed, sealed and delivered; and subject to the same general
   laws and principles of justice as all other deeds and contracts are: for
   in a transaction of this kind, the state stands as an individual, and can
   be known in no other character in a court of justice.

   By "laws", as distinct from the agency transactions, or matters of
   negotiation, are to be comprehended all those public acts of the assembly
   or commonwealth, which have a universal operation, or apply themselves to
   every individual of the commonwealth. Of this kind are the laws for the
   distribution and administration of justice, for the preservation of the
   peace, for the security of property, for raising the necessary revenue by
   just proportions, etc.

   Acts of this kind are properly laws, and they may be altered, amended and
   repealed, or others substituted in their places, as experience shall
   direct, for the better effecting the purpose for which they were intended:
   and the right and power of the assembly to do this is derived from the
   right and power which the people, were they all assembled together,
   instead of being represented, would have to do the same thing: because, in
   acts or laws of this kind, there is no other party than the public.

   The law, or the alteration, or the repeal, is for themselves;-and whatever
   the effects may be, it falls on themselves;-if for the better, they have
   the benefit of it-if for the worse, they suffer the inconvenience. No
   violence to anyone is here offered-no breach of faith is here committed.
   It is therefore one of those rights and powers which is within the sense,
   meaning and limits of the original compact of justice which they formed
   with each other as the foundation-principle of the republic, and being one
   of those rights and powers, it devolves on their representatives by
   delegation.

   As it is not my intention (neither is it within the limits assigned to
   this work) to define every species of what may be called laws (but rather
   to distinguish that part in which the representatives act as agents or
   negotiators for the state from the legislative part) I shall pass on to
   distinguish and describe those acts of the assembly which are acts of
   agency or negotiation, and to show that as they are different in their
   nature, construction and operation, from legislative acts, so likewise the
   power and authority of the assembly over them, after they are passed, is
   different.

   It must occur to every person on the first reflection, that the affairs
   and circumstances of a commonwealth require other business to be done
   besides that of making laws, and, consequently, that the different kinds
   of business cannot all be classed under one name, or be subject to one and
   the same rule of treatment.

   But to proceed-

   By agency transactions, or matters of negotiation, done by the assembly,
   are to be comprehended all that kind of public business, which the
   assembly, as representatives of the republic, transact in its behalf, with
   a certain person or persons, or part or parts of the republic, for
   purposes mentioned in the act, and which the assembly confirm and ratify
   on the part of the commonwealth, by affixing to it the seal of the state.

   An act of this kind, differs from a law of the before-mentioned kind;
   because here are two parties and there but one, and the parties are bound
   to perform different and distinct parts: whereas, in the before-mentioned
   law, every man's part was the same.

   These acts, therefore, though numbered among the laws, are evidently
   distinct therefrom, and are not of the legislative kind. The former are
   laws for the government of the commonwealth; these are transactions of
   business, such as, selling and conveying an estate belonging to the
   public, or buying one; acts for borrowing money, and fixing with the
   lender the terms and modes of payment; acts of agreement and contract,
   with a certain person or persons, for certain purposes: and, in short,
   every act in which two parties, the state being one, are particularly
   mentioned or described, and in which the form and nature of a bargain or
   contract is comprehended.

   These, if for custom and uniformity sake we call them by the name of laws,
   are not laws for the government of the commonwealth, but for the
   government of the contracting parties, as all deeds and contracts are; and
   are not, properly speaking, acts of the assembly, but joint acts, or acts
   of the assembly in behalf of the commonwealth on one part, and certain
   persons therein mentioned on the other part.

   Acts of this kind are distinguishable into two classes:

   First-Those wherein the matters inserted in the act have already been
   settled and adjusted between the state on one part, and the persons
   therein mentioned, on the other part. In this case the act is the
   completion and ratification of the contract or matters therein recited. It
   is in fact a deed signed, sealed and delivered.

   Second-Those acts wherein the matters have not been already agreed upon,
   and wherein the act only holds forth certain propositions and terms to be
   accepted of and acceded to.

   I shall give an instance of each of those acts. First, the state wants the
   loan of a sum of money; certain persons make an offer to government to
   lend that sum, and send in their proposals: the government accept these
   proposals, and all the matters of the loan and the payment are agreed on;
   and an act is passed according to the usual form of passing acts,
   ratifying and confirming this agreement. This act is final.

   In the second case-the state, as in the preceding one, wants a loan of
   money-the assembly passes an act holding forth the terms on which  it will
   borrow and pay: this act has no force until the propositions and terms are
   accepted of and acceded to by some person or persons, and when those terms
   are accepted of and complied with, the act is binding on the state.

   But if at the meeting of the next assembly, or any other, the whole  sum
   intended to be borrowed, should not be borrowed, that assembly may stop
   where they are, and discontinue proceeding with the loan, or make new
   propositions and terms for the remainder; but so far as the subscriptions
   have been filled up, and the terms complied with, it is, as in the first
   case, a signed deed; and in the same manner are all acts, let the matters
   in them be what they may, wherein, as I have before mentioned, the state
   on one part, and certain individuals on the other part, are parties in the
   act.

   If the state should become a bankrupt, the creditors, as in all cases of
   bankruptcy, will be sufferers; they will have but a dividend for the
   whole: but this is not a dissolution of the contract, but an accommodation
   of it, arising from necessity. And so in all cases of this kind, if an
   inability takes place on either side, the contract cannot be performed,
   and some accommodation must be gone into, or the matter falls through of
   itself.

   It may likewise, though it ought not to, happen that in performing the
   matters, agreeably to the terms of the act, inconveniences, unforeseen at
   the time of making the act, may arise to either or both parties: in this
   case, those inconveniences may be removed by the mutual consent and
   agreement of the parties, and each finds its benefit in so doing: for in a
   republic it is the harmony of its parts that constitutes their several and
   mutual good.

   But the acts themselves are legally binding, as much as if they had been
   made between two private individuals. The greatness of one party cannot
   give it a superiority or advantage over the other. The state, or its
   representatives, the assembly, has no more power over an act of this kind,
   alter it has passed, than if the state was a private person. It is the
   glory of a republic to have it so, because it secures the individual from
   becoming the prey of power, and prevents might from overcoming right.

   If any difference or dispute arise afterward between the state and the
   individuals with whom the agreement is made respecting the contract, or
   the meaning, or extent of any of the matters contained in the act, which
   may affect the property or interest of either, such difference or dispute
   must be judged of, and decided upon, by the laws of the land, in a court
   of justice and trial by jury; that is, by the laws of the land already in
   being at the time such act and contract was made.

   No law made afterwards can apply to the case, either directly, or by
   construction or implication: for such a law would be a retrospective law,
   or a law made after the fact, and cannot even be produced in court as
   applying to the case before it for judgment.

   That this is justice, that it is the true principle of republican
   government, no man will be so hardy as to deny. If, therefore, a lawful
   contract or agreement, sealed and ratified, cannot be affected or altered
   by any act made afterwards, how much more inconsistent and irrational,
   despotic and unjust would it be, to think of making an act with the
   professed intention of breaking up a contract already signed and sealed.

   That it is possible an assembly, in the heat and indiscretion of party,
   and meditating on power rather than on the principle by which all power in
   a republican government is governed, that of equal justice, may fall into
   the error of passing such an act, is admitted;-but it would be an actless
   act, an act that goes for nothing, an act which the courts of justice and
   the established laws of the land, could know nothing of.

   Because such an act would be an act of one party only, not only without,
   but against the consent of the other; and therefore, cannot be produced to
   affect a contract made between the two. That the violation of a contract
   should be set up as a justification to the violator, would be the same
   thing as to say, that a man by breaking his promise is freed from the
   obligation of it, or that by transgressing the laws, he exempts himself
   from the punishment of them.

   Besides the constitutional and legal reasons why an assembly cannot, of
   its own act and authority, undo or make void a contract made between the
   state (by a former assembly) and certain individuals, may be added what
   may be called the natural reasons, or those reasons which the plain rules
   of common sense point out to every man. Among which are the following:

   The principals, or real parties in the contract, are the state and the
   persons contracted with. The assembly is not a party, but an agent in
   behalf of the state, authorized and empowered to transact its affairs.

   Therefore, it is the state that is bound on one part and certain
   individuals on the other part, and the performance of the contract,
   according to the conditions of it, devolves on succeeding assemblies, not
   as principals, but as agents.

   Therefore, for the next or any other assembly to undertake to dissolve the
   state from its obligation is an assumption of power of a novel and
   extraordinary kind. It is the servant attempting to free his master.

   The election of new assemblies following each other makes no difference in
   the nature of things. The state is still the same state. The public is
   still the same body. These do not annually expire, though the time of an
   assembly does. These are not new-created every year, nor can they be
   displaced from their original standing; but are a perpetual, permanent
   body, always in being and still the same.

   But if we adopt the vague, inconsistent idea that every new assembly has a
   full and complete authority over every act done by the state in a former
   assembly, and confound together laws, contracts, and every species of
   public business, it will lead us into a wilderness of endless confusion
   and insurmountable difficulties. It would be declaring an assembly
   despotic, for the time being.

   Instead of a government of established principles administered by
   established rules, the authority of government, by being strained so high,
   would, by the same rule, be reduced proportionately as low, and would be
   no other than that of a committee of the state, acting with discretionary
   powers for one year. Every new election would be a new revolution, or it
   would suppose the public of the former year dead and a new public in its
   place.

   Having now endeavored to fix a precise idea to, and distinguish between
   legislative acts and acts of negotiation and agency, I shall proceed to
   apply this distinction to the case now in dispute, respecting the charter
   of the bank.

   The charter of the bank, or what is the same thing, the act for
   incorporating it, is to all intents and purposes an act of negotiation and
   contract, entered into, and confirmed between the State on one part, and
   certain persons mentioned therein on the other part. The purpose for which
   the act, was done on the part of the State is therein recited, viz., the
   support which the finances of the country would derive therefrom. The
   incorporating clause is the condition or obligation on the part of the
   State; and the obligation on the part of the bank, is "that nothing
   contained in that act shall be construed to authorize the said corporation
   to exercise any powers in this State repugnant to the laws or constitution
   thereof."

   Here are all the marks and evidences of a contract. The parties-the
   purport-and the reciprocal obligations.

   That this is a contract, or a joint act, is evident from its being in the
   power of either of the parties to have forbidden or prevented its being
   done. The State could not force the stockholders of the bank to be a
   corporation, and therefore, as their consent was necessary to the making
   the act, their dissent would have prevented its being made; so, on the
   other hand, as the bank could not force the State to incorporate them, the
   consent or dissent of the State would have had the same effect to do, or
   to prevent its being done; and as neither of the parties could make the
   act alone, for the same reason can neither of them dissolve it alone: but
   this is not the case with a law or act of legislation, and therefore, the
   difference proves it to be an act of a different kind.

   The bank may forfeit the charter by delinquency, but the delinquency must
   be proved and established by a legal process in a court of justice and
   trial by jury; for the state, or the assembly, is not to be a judge in its
   own case, but must come to the laws of the land for judgment; for that
   which is law for the individual, is likewise law for the state.

   Before I enter further into this affair, I shall go back to the
   circumstances of the country, and the condition the government was in, for
   some time before, as well as at the time it entered into this engagement
   with the bank, and this act of incorporation was passed: for the
   government of this State, and I suppose the same of the rest, were then in
   want of two of the most essential matters which governments could be
   destitute of-money and credit.

   In looking back to those times, and bringing forward some of the
   circumstances attending them, I feel myself entering on unpleasant and
   disagreeable ground; because some of the matters which the attacks on the
   bank now make it necessary to state, in order to bring the affair fully
   before the public, will not add honor to those who have promoted that
   measure and carried it through the late House of Assembly; and for whom,
   though my own judgment and opinion on the case oblige me to differ from, I
   retain my esteem, and the social remembrance of times past.

   But, I trust, those gentlemen will do me the justice to recollect my
   exceeding earnestness with them, last spring, when the attack on the bank
   first broke out; for it clearly appeared to me one of those over-heated
   measures, which, neither the country at large, nor their own constituents,
   would justify them in, when it came to be fully understood; for however
   high a party measure may be carried in an assembly, the people out of
   doors are all the while following their several occupations and
   employments, minding their farms and their business, and take their own
   time and leisure to judge of public measures; the consequence of which is,
   that they often judge in a cooler spirit than their representatives act
   in.

   It may be easily recollected that the present bank was preceded by, and
   rose out of a former one, called the Pennsylvania Bank which began a few
   months before; the occasion of which I shall briefly state.

   In the spring of 1780, the Pennsylvania Assembly was composed of many of
   the same members, and nearly all of the same connection, which composed
   the late House that began the attack on the bank. I served as Clerk of the
   Assembly of 1780, which station I resigned at the end of the year, and
   accompanied a much lamented friend, the late Colonel John Laurens, on an
   embassy to France.

   The spring of 1780 was marked with an accumulation of misfortunes. The
   reliance placed on the defense of Charleston failed, and exceedingly
   lowered or depressed the spirits of the country. The measures of
   government, from the want of money, means and credit, dragged on like a
   heavy loaded carriage without wheels, and were nearly got to what a
   countryman would understand by a dead pull.

   The Assembly of that year met, by adjournment, at an unusual time, the
   tenth of May, and what particularly added to the affliction, was, that so
   many of the members, instead of spiriting up their constituents to the
   most nervous exertions, came to the Assembly furnished with petitions to
   be exempt from paying taxes. How the public measures were to be carried
   on, the country defended, and the army recruited, clothed, fed, and paid,
   when the only resource, and that not half sufficient, that of taxes,
   should be relaxed to almost nothing, was a matter too gloomy to look at.

   A language very different from that of petitions ought at this time to
   have been the language of everyone. A declaration to have stood forth with
   their lives and fortunes, and a reprobation of every thought of partial
   indulgence would have sounded much better than petitions.

   While the Assembly was sitting, a letter from the commander-in-chief was
   received by the executive council and transmitted to the House. The
   doors-were shut, and it fell officially to me to read.

   In this letter the naked truth of things was unfolded. Among other
   informations, the general said, that notwithstanding his confidence in the
   attachment of the army to the cause of the country, the distress of it,
   from the want of every necessary which men could be destitute of, had
   arisen to such a pitch, that the appearances of mutiny and discontent were
   so strongly marked on the countenance of the army, that he dreaded the
   event of every hour.

   When the letter was read, I observed a despairing silence in the House.
   Nobody spoke for a considerable time. At length, a member, of whose
   fortitude to withstand misfortunes I had a high opinion, rose:

   "If," said he, "the account in that letter is a true state of things, and
   we are in the situation there represented, it appears to me in vain to
   contend the matter any longer. We may as well give up at first as at
   last."

   The gentleman who spoke next, was (to the best of my recollection) a
   member of Bucks County, who, in a cheerful note, endeavored to dissipate
   the gloom of the House:

   "Well, well," said he, "don't let the House despair. If things are not so
   well as we wish, we must endeavor to make them better."

   And on a motion for adjournment, the conversation went no further.

   There was now no time to lose, and something absolutely necessary to be
   done, which was not within the immediate power of the House to do; for
   what with the depreciation of the currency, and slow operation of taxes,
   and the petitions to be exempted therefrom, the treasury was moneyless and
   the Government creditless.

   If the Assembly could not give the assistance which the necessity of the
   case immediately required, it was very proper the matter should be known
   by those who either could or would endeavor to do it. To conceal the
   information within the House, and not provide the relief which that
   information required, was making no use of the knowledge, and endangering
   the public cause. The only thing that now remained, and was capable of
   reaching the case, was private credit, and the voluntary aid of
   individuals; and under this impression, on my return from the House, I
   drew out the salary due to me as clerk, enclosed $500 to a gentleman in
   this city, in part of the whole, and wrote fully to him on the subject of
   our affairs.

   The gentleman to whom this letter was addressed is Mr. Blair M'Clenaghan.
   I mentioned to him that, notwithstanding the current opinion that the
   enemy were beaten from before Charleston, there were too many reasons to
   believe the place was then taken and in the hands of the enemy: the
   consequence of which would be that a great part of the British force would
   return, and join at New York; that our own army required to be augmented,
   ten thousand men, to be able to stand against the combined force of the
   enemy.

   I informed Mr. M'Clenaghan of General Washington's letter, the extreme
   distresses he was surrounded with, and the absolute occasion there was for
   the citizens to exert themselves at this time, which there was no doubt
   they would do, if the necessity was made known to them; for that the
   ability of Government was exhausted. I requested Mr. M'Clenaghan to
   propose a voluntary subscription among his friends and added that I had
   enclosed five hundred dollars as my mite thereto, and that I would
   increase it as far as the last ability would enable me to go. (Mr.
   M'Clenaghan being now returned from Europe, has my consent to show this
   letter to any gentleman who may be inclined to see it.-Author.)

   The next day Mr. M'Clenaghan informed me that he had communicated the
   contents of the letter, at a meeting of gentlemen at the coffeehouse, and
   that a subscription was immediately begun; that Mr. Robert Morris and
   himself had subscribed -L-200 each, in hard money, and that the
   subscription was going on very successfully. This subscription was
   intended as a donation, and to be given in bounties to promote the
   recruiting service. It is dated June 8, 1780. The original subscription
   list is now in my possession-it amounts to -L-400 hard money, and
   -L-101,360 Continental.

   While this subscription was going forward, information of the loss of
   Charleston arrived, (Colonel Tennant, aide to General Lincoln, arrived the
   fourteenth of June, with despatches of the capitulation of
   Charleston.-Author.) and on a communication from several members of
   Congress to certain gentlemen of this city, of the increasing distresses
   and dangers then taking place, a meeting was held of the subscribers, and
   such other gentlemen who chose to attend, at the city tavern. This meeting
   was on the seventeenth of June, nine days after the subscriptions had
   begun.

   At this meeting it was resolved to open a security-subscription, to the
   amount of -L-300,000, Pennsylvania currency, in real money; the
   subscribers to execute bonds to the amount of their subscriptions, and to
   form a bank thereon for supplying the army. This being resolved on and
   carried into execution, the plan of the first subscriptions was
   discontinued, and this extended one established in its stead.

   By means of this bank the army was supplied through the campaign, and
   being at the same time recruited, was enabled to maintain its ground; and
   on the appointment of Mr. Morris to be superintendent of the finances the
   spring following, he arranged the system of the present bank, styled the
   Bank of North America, and many subscribers of the former bank transferred
   their subscriptions into this.

   Toward the establishment of this bank, Congress passed an ordinance of
   incorporation, December twenty-first, which the government of Pennsylvania
   recognized by sundry matters: and afterward, on an application of the
   president and directors of the bank, through the mediation of the
   executive council, the Assembly agreed to, and passed the State Act of
   incorporation April 1, 1782.

   Thus arose the bank-produced by the distresses of the times and the
   enterprising spirit of patriotic individuals. Those individuals furnished
   and risked the money, and the aid which the Government contributed was
   that of incorporating them.

   It would have been well if the State had made all its bargains and
   contracts with as much true policy as it made this: for a greater service
   for so small a consideration, that only of an act of incorporation, has
   not been obtained since the Government existed.

   Having now shown how the bank originated, I shall proceed with my remarks.

   The sudden restoration of public and private credit, which took place on
   the establishment of the bank, is an event as extraordinary in itself as
   any domestic occurrence during the progress of the Revolution.

   How far a spirit of envy might operate to produce the attack on the bank
   during the sitting of the late Assembly, is best known and felt by those
   who began or promoted the attack. The bank had rendered services which the
   Assembly of 1780 could not, and acquired an honor which many of its
   members might be unwilling to own, and wish to obscure.

   But surely every government, acting on the principles of patriotism and
   public good, would cherish an institution capable of rendering such
   advantages to the community. The establishment of the bank in one of the
   most trying vicissitudes of the war, its zealous services in the public
   cause, its influence in restoring and supporting credit, and the
   punctuality with which all its business has been transacted, are matters,
   that so far from meriting the treatment it met with from the late
   Assembly, are an honor to the State, and what the body of her citizens may
   be proud to own.

   But the attack on the bank, as a chartered institution, under the
   protection of its violators, however criminal it may be as an error of
   government, or impolitic as a measure of party, is not to be charged on
   the constituents of those who made the attack. It appears from every
   circumstance that has come to light, to be a measure which that Assembly
   contrived of itself. The members did not come charged with the affair from
   their constituents. There was no idea of such a thing when they were
   elected or when they met. The hasty and precipitate manner in which it was
   hurried through the House, and the refusal of the House to hear the
   directors of the bank in its defense, prior to the publication of the
   repealing bill for public consideration, operated to prevent their
   constituents comprehending the subject: therefore, whatever may be wrong
   in the proceedings lies not at the door of the public. The House took the
   affair on its own shoulders, and whatever blame there is lies on them.

   The matter must have been prejudged and predetermined by a majority of the
   members out of the House before it was brought into it. The whole business
   appears to have been fixed at once, and all reasoning or debate on the
   case rendered useless.

   Petitions from a very inconsiderable number of persons, suddenly procured,
   and so privately done, as to be a secret among the few that signed them,
   were presented to the House and read twice in one day, and referred to a
   committee of the House to inquire and report thereon. I here subjoin the
   petition2 and the report, and shall exercise the right and privilege of a
   citizen in examining their merits, not for the purpose of opposition, but
   with a, design of making an intricate affair more generally and better
   understood.

   So far as my private judgment is capable of comprehending the subject, it
   appears to me that the committee were unacquainted with, and have totally
   mistaken, the nature and business of a bank, as well as the matter
   committed to them, considered as a proceeding of government.

   They were instructed by the house to inquire whether the bank established
   at Philadelphia was compatible with the public safety. It is scarcely
   possible to suppose the instructions meant no more than that they were to
   inquire of one another. It is certain they made no inquiry at the bank, to
   inform themselves of the situation of its affairs, how they were
   conducted, what aids it had rendered the public cause, or whether any; nor
   do the committee produce in their report a single fact or circumstance to
   show that they made any inquiry at all, or whether the rumors then
   circulated were true or false; but content themselves with modeling the
   insinuations of the petitions into a report and giving an opinion thereon.

   It would appear from the report, that the committee either conceived that
   the House had already determined how it would act, without regard to the
   case, and that they were only a committee for form sake, and to give a
   color of inquiry without making any, or that the case was referred to
   them, as law-questions are sometimes referred to law-officers for an
   opinion only.

   This method of doing public business serves exceedingly to mislead a
   country. When the constituents of an assembly hear that an inquiry into
   any matter is directed to be made, and a committee appointed for that
   purpose, they naturally conclude that the inquiry is made, and that the
   future proceedings of the House are in consequence of the matters, facts,
   and information obtained by means of that inquiry. But here is a committee
   of inquiry making no inquiry at all, and giving an opinion on a case
   without inquiring into the merits of it. This proceeding of the committee
   would justify an opinion that it was not their wish to get, but to get
   over information, and lest the inquiry should not suit their wishes,
   omitted to make any.

   The subsequent conduct of the House, in resolving not to hear the
   directors of the bank, on their application for that purpose, prior to the
   publication of the bill for the consideration of the people, strongly
   corroborates this opinion; for why should not the House hear them, unless
   it was apprehensive that the bank, by such a public opportunity, would
   produce proofs of its services and usefulness, that would not suit the
   temper and views of its oppressors?

   But if the House did not wish or choose to hear the defense of the bank,
   it was no reason that their constituents should not. The Constitution of
   this State, in lieu of having two branches of legislature, has
   substituted, that, "to the end that laws before they are enacted may be
   more maturely considered, and the inconvenience of hasty determinations as
   much as possible prevented, all bills of a public nature shall be printed
   for the consideration of the people." (Constitution, sect. 15th.-Author.)
   The people, therefore, according to the Constitution, stand in the place
   of another House; or, more properly speaking, are a house in their own
   right. But in this instance, the Assembly arrogates the whole power to
   itself, and places itself as a bar to stop the necessary information
   spreading among the people.

   The application of the bank to be heard before the bill was published for
   public consideration had two objects. First, to the House-and secondly,
   through the House to the people, who are as another house. It was as a
   defense in the first instance, and as an appeal in the second. But the
   Assembly absorbs the right of the people to judge; because, by refusing to
   hear the defense, they barred the appeal. Were there no other cause which
   the constituents of that Assembly had for censuring its conduct, than the
   exceeding unfairness, partiality, and arbitrariness with which its
   business was transacted, it would be cause sufficient.

   Let the constituents of assemblies differ, as they may, respecting certain
   peculiarities in the form of the constitution, they will all agree in
   supporting its principles, and in reprobating unfair proceedings and
   despotic measures. Every constituent is a member of the republic, which is
   a station of more consequence to him than being a member of a party, and
   though they may differ from each other in their choice of persons to
   transact the public business, it is of equal importance to all parties
   that the business be done on right principles; otherwise our laws and
   acts, instead of being founded in justice, will be founded in party, and
   be laws and acts of retaliation; and instead of being a republic of free
   citizens, we shall be alternately tyrants and slaves. But to return to the
   report.

   The report begins by stating that, "The committee to whom was referred the
   petitions concerning the bank established at Philadelphia, and who were
   instructed to inquire whether the said bank be compatible with the public
   safety, and that equality which ought ever to prevail between the
   individuals of a republic, beg leave to report" (not that they have made
   any inquiry, but) "that it is the opinion of this committee, that the said
   bank, as at present established, is, in every view, incompatible with the
   public safety." But why is it so? Here is an opinion unfounded and
   unwarranted. The committee have begun their report at the wrong end; for
   an opinion, when given as a matter of judgment, is an action of the mind
   which follows a fact, but here it is put in the room of one.

       

   The report then says, "that in the present state of our trade, the said
   bank has a direct tendency to banish a great part of the specie from the
   country, and to collect into the hands of the stockholders of the bank,
   almost the whole of the money which remains among us."

   Here is another mere assertion, just like the former, without a single
   fact or circumstance to show why it is made, or whereon it is founded. Now
   the very reverse of what the committee asserts is the natural consequence
   of a bank. Specie may be called the stock in trade of the bank, it is
   therefore its interest to prevent it from wandering out of the country,
   and to keep a constant standing supply to be ready for all domestic
   occasions and demands.

   Were it true that the bank has a direct tendency to banish the specie from
   the country, there would soon be an end to the bank; and, therefore, the
   committee have so far mistaken the matter, as to put their fears in the
   place of their wishes: for if it is to happen as the committee states, let
   the bank alone and it will cease of itself, and the repealing act need not
   have been passed.

   It is the interest of the bank that people should keep their cash there,
   and all commercial countries find the exceeding great convenience of
   having a general depository for their cash. But so far from banishing it,
   there are no two classes of people in America who are so much interested
   in preserving hard money in the country as the bank and the merchant.
   Neither of them can carry on their business without it. Their opposition
   to the paper money of the late Assembly was because it has a direct
   effect, as far as it is able, to banish the specie, and that without
   providing any means for bringing more in.

   The committee must have been aware of this, and therefore chose to spread
   the first alarm, and, groundless as it was, to trust to the delusion.

   As the keeping the specie in the country is the interest of the bank, so
   it has the best opportunities of preventing its being sent away, and the
   earliest knowledge of such a design. While the bank is the general
   depository of cash, no great sums can be obtained without getting it from
   thence, and as it is evidently prejudicial to its interest to advance
   money to be sent abroad, because in this case the money cannot by
   circulation return again, the bank, therefore, is interested in preventing
   what the committee would have it suspected of promoting.

   It is to prevent the exportation of cash, and to retain it in the country,
   that the bank has, on several occasions, stopped the discounting notes
   till the danger had been passed.3 The first part, therefore, of the
   assertion that of banishing the specie, contains an apprehension as
   needless as it is groundless, and which, had the committee understood, or
   been the least informed of the nature of a bank, they could not have made.
   It is very probable that some of the opposers of the bank are those
   persons who have been disappointed in their attempts to obtain specie for
   this purpose, and now disguise their opposition under other pretenses.

   I now come to the second part of the assertion, which is, that when the
   bank has banished a great part of the specie from the country, "it will
   collect into the hands of the stockholders almost the whole of the money
   which remains among us." But how, or by what means, the bank is to
   accomplish this wonderful feat, the committee have not informed us.
   Whether people are to give their money to the bank for nothing, or whether
   the bank is to charm it from them as a rattlesnake charms a squirrel from
   a tree, the committee have left us as much in the dark about as they were
   themselves.

   Is it possible the committee should know so very little of the matter, as
   not to know that no part of the money which at any time may be in the bank
   belongs to the stockholders? Not even the original capital which they put
   in is any part of it their own, until every person who has a demand upon
   the bank is paid, and if there is not a sufficiency for this purpose, on
   the balance of loss and gain, the original money of the stock-holders must
   make up the deficiency.

   The money, which at any time may be in the bank, is the property of every
   man who holds a bank note, or deposits cash there, or who has a just
   demand upon it from the city of Philadelphia up to Fort Pitt, or to any
   part of the United States; and he can draw the money from it when he
   pleases. Its being in the bank, does not in the least make it the property
   of the stockholders, any more than the money in the state treasury is the
   property of the state treasurer. They are only stewards over it for those
   who please to put it, or let it remain there: and, therefore, this second
   part of the assertion is somewhat ridiculous.

   The next paragraph in the report is, "that the accumulation of enormous
   wealth in the hands of a society who claim perpetual duration, will
   necessarily produce a degree of influence and power which cannot be
   entrusted in the hands of any set of men whatsoever" (the committee I
   presume excepted) "without endangering public safety." There is an air of
   solemn fear in this paragraph which is something like introducing a ghost
   in a play to keep people from laughing at the players.

   I have already shown that whatever wealth there may be, at any time, in
   the bank, is the property of those who have demands upon the bank, and not
   the property of the stockholders. As a society they hold no property, and
   most probably never will, unless it should be a house to transact their
   business in, instead of hiring one. Every half year the bank settles its
   accounts, and each individual stockholder takes his dividend of gain or
   loss to himself, and the bank begins the next half year in the same manner
   it began the first, and so on. This being the nature of a bank, there can
   be no accumulation of wealth among them as a society.

   For what purpose the word "society" is introduced into the report I do not
   know, unless it be to make a false impression upon people's minds. It has
   no connection with the subject, for the bank is not a society, but a
   company, and denominated so in the charter. There are several religious
   societies incorporated in this State, which hold property as the right of
   those societies, and to which no person can belong that is not of the same
   religious profession. But this is not the case with the bank. The bank is
   a company for the promotion and convenience of commerce, which is a matter
   in which all the State is interested, and holds no property in the manner
   which those societies do.

   But there is a direct contradiction in this paragraph to that which goes
   before it. The cornmittee, there, accuses the bank of banishing the
   specie, and here, of accumulating enormous sums of it. So here are two
   enormous sums of specie; one enormous sum going out, and another enormous
   sum remaining. To reconcile this contradiction, the committee should have
   added to their report, that they suspected the bank had found out the
   philosopher's stone, and kept it a secret.

   The next paragraph is, "that the said bank, in its corporate capacity, is
   empowered to hold estates to the amount of ten millions of dollars, and by
   the tenor of the present charter is to exist for ever, without being
   obliged to yield any emolument to the government, or be in the least
   dependent on it."

   The committee have gone so vehemently into this business, and so
   completely shown their want of knowledge in every point of it, as to make,
   in the first part of this paragraph, a fear of what, the greater fear is,
   will never happen. Had the committee known anything of banking, they must
   have known, that the objection against banks has been (not that they held
   great estates but) that they held none; that they had no real, fixed, and
   visible property, and that it is the maxim and practice of banks not to
   hold any.

   The Honorable Chancellor Livingston, late Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
   did me the honor of showing, and discoursing with me on a plan of a bank
   he had drawn up for the State of New York. In this plan it was made a
   condition or obligation, that whatever the capital of the bank amounted to
   in specie, there should be added twice as much in real estates. But the
   mercantile interest rejected the proposition.

   It was a very good piece of policy in the Assembly which passed the
   charter act, to add the clause to empower the bank to purchase and hold
   real estates. It was as an inducement to the bank to do it, because such
   estates being held as the property of the bank would be so many mortgages
   to the public in addition to the money capital of the bank.

   But the doubt is that the bank will not be induced to accept the
   opportunity. The bank has existed five years, and has not purchased a
   shilling of real property: and as such property or estates cannot be
   purchased by the bank but with the interest money which the stock
   produces, and as that is divided every half year among the stockholders,
   and each stockholder chooses to have the management of his own dividend,
   and if he lays it out in purchasing an estate to have that estate his own
   private property, and under his own immediate management, there is no
   expectation, so far from being any fear, that the clause will be accepted.

   Where knowledge is a duty, ignorance is a crime; and the committee are
   criminal in not understanding this subject better. Had this clause not
   been in the charter, the committee might have reported the want of it as a
   defect, in not empowering the bank to hold estates as a real security to
   its creditors: but as the complaint now stands, the accusation of it is,
   that the charter empowers the bank to give real security to its creditors.
   A complaint never made, heard of, or thought of before.

   The second article in this paragraph is, "that the bank, according to the
   tenor of the present charter, is to exist forever." Here I agree with the
   committee, and am glad to find that among such a list of errors and
   contradictions there is one idea which is not wrong, although the
   committee have made a wrong use of it.

   As we are not to live forever ourselves, and other generations are to
   follow us, we have neither the power nor the right to govern them, or to
   say how they shall govern themselves. It is the summit of human vanity,
   and shows a covetousness of power beyond the grave, to be dictating to the
   world to come. It is sufficient that we do that which is right in our own
   day, and leave them with the advantage of good examples.

   As the generations of the world are every day both commencing and
   expiring, therefore, when any public act, of this sort, is done, it
   naturally supposes the age of that generation to be then beginning, and
   the time contained between coming of age, and the natural end of life, is
   the extent of time it has a right to go to, which may be about thirty
   years; for though many may die before, others will live beyond; and the
   mean time is equally fair for all generations.

   If it was made an article in the Constitution, that all laws and acts
   should cease of themselves in thirty years, and have no legal force beyond
   that time, it would prevent their becoming too numerous and voluminous,
   and serve to keep them within view in a compact compass. Such as were
   proper to be continued, would be enacted again, and those which were not,
   would go into oblivion. There is the same propriety that a nation should
   fix a time for a full settlement of its affairs, and begin again from a
   new date, as that an individual should; and to keep within the distance of
   thirty years would be a convenient period.

   The British, from the want of some general regulation of this kind, have a
   great number of obsolete laws; which, though out of use and forgotten, are
   not out of force, and are occasionally brought up for particular purposes,
   and innocent, unwary persons trepanned thereby.

   To extend this idea still further-it would probably be a considerable
   improvement in the political system of nations, to make all treaties of
   peace for a limited time. It is the nature of the mind to feel uneasy
   under the idea of a condition perpetually existing over it, and to excite
   in itself apprehensions that would not take place were it not from that
   cause.

   Were treaties of peace made for, and renewable every seven or ten years,
   the natural effect would be, to make peace continue longer than it does
   under the custom of making peace forever. If the parties felt, or
   apprehended, any inconveniences under the terms already made, they would
   look forward to the time when they should be eventually relieved
   therefrom, and might renew the treaty on improved conditions.

   This opportunity periodically occurring, and the recollection of it always
   existing, would serve as a chimney to the political fabric, to carry off
   the smoke and fume of national fire. It would naturally abate and
   honorably take off the edge and occasion for fighting: and how- ever the
   parties might determine to do it, when the time of the treaty should
   expire, it would then seem like fighting in cool blood: the fighting
   temper would be dissipated before the fighting time arrived, and
   negotiation supply its place. To know how probable this may be, a man need
   do no more than observe the progress of his own mind on any private
   circumstance similar in its nature to a public one. But to return to my
   subject.

   To give limitation is to give duration: and though it is not a justifying
   reason, that because an act or contract is not to last forever, that it
   shall be broken or violated to-day, yet, where no time is mentioned, the
   omission affords an opportunity for the abuse. When we violate a contract
   on this pretense, we assume a right that belongs to the next generation;
   for though they, as a following generation, have the right of altering or
   setting it aside, as not being concerned in the making it, or not being
   done in their day, we, who made it, have not that right; and, therefore,
   the committee, in this part of their report, have made a wrong use of a
   right principle; and as this clause in the charter might have been altered
   by the consent of the parties, it cannot be produced to justify the
   violation. And were it not altered there would be no inconvenience from
   it.

   The term "forever" is an absurdity that would have no effect. The next age
   will think for itself, by the same rule of right that we have done, and
   not admit any assumed authority of ours to encroach upon the system of
   their day. Our forever ends, where their forever begins.

   The third article in this paragraph is, that the bank holds its charter
   "without being obliged to yield any emolument to the Government."

   Ingratitude has a short memory. It was on the failure of the Government to
   support the public cause, that the bank originated. It stepped in as a
   support, when some of the persons then in the Government, and who now
   oppose the bank, were apparently on the point of abandoning the cause, not
   from disaffection, but from despair. While the expenses of the war were
   carried on by emissions of Continental money, any set of men, in
   government, might carry it on. The means being provided to their hands,
   required no great exertions of fortitude or wisdom; but when this means
   failed, they would have failed with it, had not a public spirit awakened
   itself with energy out-of-doors. It was easy times to the governments
   while Continental money lasted. The dream of wealth supplied the reality
   of it; but when the dream vanished, the government did not awake.

   But what right has the government to expect any emolument from the bank?
   Does the committee mean to set up acts and charters for sale, or what do
   they mean? Because it is the practice of the British Ministry to grind a
   toll out of every public institution they can get a power over, is the
   same practice to be followed here?

   The war being now ended, and the bank having rendered the service
   expected, or rather hoped for, from it, the principal public use of it, at
   this time, is for the promotion and extension of commerce. The whole
   community derives benefit from the operation of the bank. It facilitates
   the commerce of the country. It quickens the means of purchasing and
   paying for country produce, and hastens on the exportation of it. The
   emolument, therefore, being to the community, it is the office and duty of
   government to give protection to the bank.

   Among many of the principal conveniences arising from the bank, one of
   them is, that it gives a kind of life to, what would otherwise be, dead
   money. Every merchant and person in trade, has always in his hands some
   quantity of cash, which constantly remains with him; that is, he is never
   entirely without: this remnant money, as it may be called, is of no use to
   him till more is collected to it. He can neither buy produce nor
   merchandise with it, and this being the case with every person in trade,
   there will be (though not all at the same time) as many of those sums
   lying uselessly by, and scattered throughout the city, as there are
   persons in trade, besides many that are not in trade.

   I should not suppose the estimate overrated, in conjecturing, that half
   the money in the city, at any one time, lies in this manner. By collecting
   those scattered sums together, which is done by means of the bank, they
   become capable of being used, and the quantity of circulating cash is
   doubled, and by the depositors alternately lending them to each other, the
   commercial system is invigorated: and as it is the interest of the bank to
   preserve this money in the country for domestic uses only, and as it has
   the best opportunity of doing so, the bank serves as a sentinel over the
   specie.

   If a farmer, or a miller, comes to the city with produce, there are but
   few merchants that can individually purchase it with ready money of their
   own; and those few would command nearly the whole market for country
   produce; but, by means of the bank, this monopoly is prevented, and the
   chance of the market enlarged.

   It is very extraordinary that the late Assembly should promote
   monopolizing; yet such would be the effect of suppressing the bank; and it
   is much to the honor of those merchants, who are capable by their fortunes
   of becoming monopolizers, that they support the bank. In this case, honor
   operates over interest. They were the persons who first set up the bank,
   and their honor is now engaged to support what it is their interest to put
   down.

   If merchants, by this means, or farmers, by similar means, among
   themselves, can mutually aid and support each other, what has the
   government to do with it? What right has it to expect emolument from
   associated industry, more than from individual industry? It would be a
   strange sort of government, that should make it illegal for people to
   assist each other, or pay a tribute for doing so.

   But the truth is, that the government has already derived emoluments, and
   very extraordinary ones. It has already received its full share, by the
   services of the bank during the war; and it is every day receiving
   benefits, because whatever promotes and facilitates commerce, serves
   likewise to promote and facilitate the revenue.

   The last article in this paragraph is, "that the bank is not the least
   dependent on the government."

   Have the committee so soon forgotten the principles of republican
   government and Constitution, or are they so little acquainted with them,
   as not to know, that this article in their report partakes of the nature
   of treason? Do they not know, that freedom is destroyed by dependence, and
   the safety of the state endangered thereby? Do they not see, that to hold
   any part of the citizens of the state, as yearly pensioners on the favor
   of an assembly, is striking at the root of free elections?

   If other parts of their report discover a want of knowledge on the subject
   of banks, this shows a want of principle in the science of government.

   Only let us suppose this dangerous idea carried into practice, and then
   see what it leads to. If corporate bodies are, after their incorporation
   to be annually dependent on an assembly for the continuance of their
   charter, the citizens which compose those corporations, are not free. The
   Government holds an authority and influence over them, in a manner
   different from what it does over other citizens, and by this means
   destroys that equality of freedom, which is the bulwark of the republic
   and the Constitution.

   By this scheme of government any party, which happens to be uppermost, in
   a state, will command all the corporations in it, and may create more for
   the purpose of extending that influence. The dependent borough towns in
   England are the rotten parts of their government and this idea of the
   committee has a very near relation to it.

   "If you do not do so and so," expressing what was meant, "take care of
   your charter," was a threat thrown out against the bank. But as I do not
   wish to enlarge on a disagreeable circumstance and hope that what is
   already said is sufficient to show the anti-constitutional conduct and
   principles of the committee, I shall pass on to the next paragraph in the
   report. Which is-

   "That the great profits of the bank, which will daily increase as money
   grows scarcer, and which already far exceed the profits of European banks,
   have tempted foreigners to vest their money in this bank, and thus to draw
   from us large sums for interest."

   Had the committee understood the subject, some dependence might be put on
   their opinion which now cannot. Whether money will grow scarcer, and
   whether the profits of the bank will increase, are more than the committee
   know, or are judges sufficient to guess at. The committee are not so
   capable of taking care of commerce, as commerce is capable of taking care
   of itself.

   The farmer understands farming, and the merchant understands commerce; and
   as riches are equally the object of both, there is no occasion that either
   should fear that the other will seek to be poor. The more money the
   merchant has, so much the better for the farmer who has produce to sell;
   and the richer the farmer is, so much the better for the merchant, when he
   comes to his store.

   As to the profits of the bank, the stockholders must take their chance for
   it. It may some years be more and others less, and upon the whole may not
   be so productive as many other ways that money may be employed. It is the
   convenience which the stockholders, as commercial men, derive from the
   establishment of the bank, and not the mere interest they receive, that is
   the inducement to them. It is the ready opportunity of borrowing
   alternately of each other that forms the principal object: and as they pay
   as well as receive a great part of the interest among themselves, it is
   nearly the same thing, both cases considered at once, whether it is more
   or less.

   The stockholders are occasionally depositors and sometimes borrowers of
   the bank. They pay interest for what they borrow, and receive none for
   what they deposit; and were a stockholder to keep a nice account of the
   interest he pays for the one and loses on the other, he would find, at the
   year's end, that ten per cent on his stock would probably not be more than
   common interest on the whole, if so much.

   As to the committee complaining "that foreigners by vesting their money in
   the bank will draw large sums from us for interest," it is like a miller
   complaining, in a dry season, that so much water runs into his dam some of
   it runs over.

   Could those foreigners draw this interest without putting in any capital,
   the complaint would be well founded; but as they must first put money in
   before they can draw any out, as they must draw many years before they can
   draw even the numerical sum they put in at first, the effect for at least
   twenty years to come, will be directly contrary to what the committee
   states; because we draw capital from them and they only interest from us,
   and as we shall have the use of the money all the while it remains with
   us, the advantage will always be in our favor. In framing this part of the
   report, the committee must have forgotten which side of the Atlantic they
   were on, for the case would be as they state it if we put money into their
   bank instead of their putting it into ours.

   I have now gone through, line by line, every objection against the bank,
   contained in the first half of the report; what follows may be called, The
   lamentations of the committee, and a lamentable, pusillanimous, degrading
   thing it is.

   It is a public affront, a reflection upon the sense and spirit of the
   whole country. I shall give the remainder together, as it stands in the
   report, and then my remarks. The lamentations are:

   That foreigners will doubtless be more and more induced to become
   stock holders, until the time may arrive when this enormous engine of
   power may become subject to foreign influence, this country may be
   agitated by the politics of European courts, and the good people of
   America reduced once more into a state of subordination and dependence
   upon some one or other of the European powers. That at best, if it were
   even confined to the hands of Americans, it would be totally destructive
   of that equality which ought to prevail in a republic. We have nothing in
   our free and equal government capable of balancing the influence which
   this bank must create; and we see nothing which in the course of a few
   years can prevent the directors of the bank from governing Pennsylvania.
   Already we have felt its influence indirectly interfering in the measures
   of the Legislature. Already the House of Assembly, the representatives of
   the people, have been threatened, that the credit of our paper currency
   will be blasted by he bank; and if this growing evil continues, we fear
   the time is not very distant when the bank will be able to dictate to the
   Legislature, what laws to pass and what to forbear.

   When the sky falls we shall all be killed. There is something so
   ridiculously grave, so wide of probability, and so wild, confused and
   inconsistent in the whole composition of this long paragraph, that I am at
   a loss how to begin upon it.

   It is like a drowning man crying fire! fire!

   This part of the report is made up of two dreadful predictions. The first
   is, that if foreigners purchase bank stock, we shall be all ruined;- the
   second is, that if the Americans keep the bank to themselves, we shall be
   also ruined.

   A committee of fortune-tellers is a novelty in government, and the
   gentlemen, by giving this specimen of their art, have ingeniously saved
   their honor on one point, which is, that though the people may say they
   are not bankers, nobody can say they are not conjurers. There is, however,
   one consolation left, which is, that the committee do not know exactly how
   long it may be; so there is some hope that we may all be in heaven when
   this dreadful calamity happens upon earth.

   But to be serious, if any seriousness is necessary on so laughable a
   subject. If the State should think there is anything improper in
   foreigners purchasing bank stock, or any other kind of stock or funded
   property (for I see no reason why bank stock should be particularly
   pointed at) the Legislature have authority to prohibit it. It is a mere
   political opinion that has nothing to do with the charter, or the charter
   with that; and therefore the first dreadful prediction vanishes.

   It has always been a maxim in politics, founded on, and drawn from,
   natural causes and consequences, that the more foreign countries which any
   nation can interest in the prosperity of its own, so much the better.
   Where the treasure is, there will the heart be also; and therefore when
   foreigners [invest their money with us, they naturally invest their good
   wishes with it; and it is we that obtain an influence over them, not they
   over us. But the committee set out so very wrong at first, that the
   further they traveled, the more they were out of their way; and now they
   have got to the end of their report, they are at the utmost distance from
   their business.

   As to the second dreadful part, that of the bank overturning the
   government, perhaps the committee meant that at the next general election
   themselves might be turned out of it, which has partly been the case; not
   by the influence of the bank, for it had none, not even enough to obtain
   the permission of a hearing from government, but by the influence of
   reason and the choice of the people, who most probably resent the undue
   and unconstitutional influence which that House and committee were
   assuming over the privileges of citizenship.

   The committee might have been so modest as to have confined themselves to
   the bank, and not thrown a general odium on the whole country. Before the
   events can happen which the committee predict, the electors of
   Pennsylvania must become dupes, dunces, and cowards, and, therefore, when
   the committee predict the dominion of the bank they predict the disgrace
   of the people.

   The committee having finished their report, proceed to give their advice,
   which is:

   That a committee be appointed to bring in a bill to repeal the act of
   Assembly passed the first day of April, 1782, entitled, "An act to
   incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of North America," and also to
   repeal one other act of the Assembly passed the eighteenth of March, 1782,
   entitled, "An act for preventing and punishing the counterfeiting of the
   common seal, bank bills and bank notes of the president, directors and
   company of the Bank of North America, and for other purposes therein
   mentioned."

   There is something in this sequel to the report that is perplexed and
   obscure.

   Here are two acts to be repealed. One is, the incorporating act. The
   other, the act for preventing and punishing the counterfeiting of the
   common seal, bank bills, and bank notes of the president, directors and
   company of the Bank of North America.

   It would appear from the committee's manner of arranging them (were it not
   for the difference of their dates) that the act for punishing the
   counterfeiting the common seal, etc., of the bank followed the act of
   incorporation, and that the common seal there referred to is a common seal
   which the bank held in consequence of the aforesaid incorporating act. But
   the case is quite otherwise. The act for punishing the counterfeiting the
   common seal, etc. of the bank, was passed prior to the incorporating act,
   and refers to the common seal which the bank held in consequence of the
   charter of Congress, and the style which the act expresses, of president,
   directors and company of the Bank of North America, is the corporate style
   which the bank derives under the Congress charter.

   The punishing act, therefore, hath two distinct legal points. The one is,
   an authoritative public recognition of the charter of Congress. The second
   is, the punishment it inflicts on counterfeiting.

   The Legislature may repeal the punishing part but it cannot undo the
   recognition, because no repealing act can say that the State has not
   recognized. The recognition is a mere matter of fact, and no law or act
   can undo a fact, or put it, if I may so express it, in the condition it
   was before it existed. The repealing act therefore does not reach the full
   point the committee had in view; for even admitting it to be a repeal of
   the state charter, it still leaves another charter recognized in its
   stead.

   The charter of Congress, standing merely on itself, would have a doubtful
   authority, but recognition of it by the state gives it legal ability. The
   repealing act, it is true sets aside the punishment, but does not bar the
   operation of the charter of Congress as a charter recognized by the state,
   and therefore the committee did their business but by halves.

   I have now gone entirely through the report of the committee, and a more
   irrational, inconsistent, contradictory report will scarcely be found on
   the journals of any legislature of America.

   How the repealing act is to be applied, or in what manner it is to
   operate, is a matter yet to be determined. For admitting a question of law
   to arise, whether the charter, which that act attempts to repeal, is a law
   of the land in the manner which laws of universal operation are, or of the
   nature of a contract made between the public and the bank (as I have
   already explained in this work), the repealing act does not and cannot
   decide the question, because it is the repealing act that makes the
   question, and its own fate is involved in the decision. It is a question
   of law and not a question of legislation, and must be decided on in a
   court of justice and not by a house of assembly.

   But the repealing act, by being passed prior to the decision of this
   point, assumes the power of deciding it, and the assembly in so doing
   erects itself unconstitutionally into a tribunal of judicature, and
   absorbs the authority and right of the courts of justice into itself.

   Therefore the operation of the repealing act, in its very outset, requires
   injustice to be done. For it is impossible on the principles of a
   republican government and the Constitution, to pass an act to forbid any
   of the citizens the right of appealing to the courts of justice on any
   matter in which his interest or property is affected; but the first
   operation of this act goes to shut up the courts of justice and holds them
   subservient to the Assembly. It either commands or influences them not to
   hear the case, or to give judgment on it on the mere will of one party
   only.

   I wish the citizens to awaken themselves on this subject. Not because the
   bank is concerned, but because their own constitutional rights and
   privileges are involved in the event. It is a question of exceeding great
   magnitude; for if an assembly is to have this power, the laws of the land
   and the courts of justice are but of little use.

   Having now finished with the report, I proceed to the third and last
   subject-that of paper money.

   I remember a German farmer expressing as much in a few words as the whole
   subject requires; "money is money, and paper is paper."

   All the invention of man cannot make them otherwise. The alchemist may
   cease his labors, and the hunter after the philosopher's stone go to rest,
   if paper can be metamorphosed into gold and silver, or made to answer the
   same purpose in all cases.

   Gold and silver are the emissions of nature: paper is the emission of art.
   The value of gold and silver is ascertained by the quantity which nature
   has made in the earth. We cannot make that quantity more or less than it
   is, and therefore the value being dependent upon the quantity, depends not
   on man. Man has no share in making gold or silver; all that his labors and
   ingenuity can accomplish is, to collect it from the mine, refine it for
   use and give it an impression, or stamp it into coin.

   Its being stamped into coin adds considerably to its convenience but
   nothing to its value. It has then no more value than it had before. Its
   value is not in the impression but in itself. Take away the impression and
   still the same value remains. Alter it as you will, or expose it to any
   misfortune that can happen, still the value is not diminished. It has a
   capacity to resist the accidents that destroy other things. It has,
   there-fore, all the requisite qualities that money can have, and is a fit
   material to make money of; and nothing which has not all those properties,
   can be fit for the purpose of money.

   Paper, considered as a material whereof to make money, has none of the
   requisite qualities in it. It is too plentiful, and too easily come at. It
   can be had anywhere, and for a trifle.

   There are two ways in which I shall consider paper.

   The only proper use for paper, in the room of money, is to write
   promissory notes and obligations of payment in specie upon. A piece of
   paper, thus written and signed, is worth the sum it is given for, if the
   person who gives it is able to pay it; because in this case, the law will
   oblige him. But if he is worth nothing, the paper note is worth nothing.
   The value, therefore, of such a note, is not in the note itself, for that
   is but paper and promise, but in the man who is obliged to redeem it with
   gold or silver.

   Paper, circulating in this manner, and for this purpose, continually
   points to the place and person where, and of whom, the money is to be had,
   and at last finds its home; and, as it were, unlocks its master's chest
   and pays the bearer.

   But when an assembly undertake to issue paper as money, the whole system
   of safety and certainty is overturned, and property set afloat. Paper
   notes given and taken between individuals as a promise of payment is one
   thing, but paper issued by an assembly as money is another thing. It is
   like putting an apparition in the place of a man; it vanishes with looking
   at it, and nothing remains but the air.

   Money, when considered as the fruit of many years' industry, as the reward
   of labor, sweat and toil, as the widow's dowry and children's portion, and
   as the means of procuring the necessaries and alleviating the afflictions
   of life, and making old age a scene of rest has something in it sacred
   that is not to be sported with, or trusted to the airy bubble of paper
   currency.

   By what power or authority an assembly undertakes to make paper money, is
   difficult to say. It derives none from the Constitution, for that is
   silent on the subject. It is one of those things which the people have not
   delegated, and which, were they at any time assembled together, they would
   not delegate. It is, therefore, an assumption of power which an assembly
   is not warranted in, and which may, one day or other, be the means of
   bringing some of them to punishment.

   I shall enumerate some of the evils of paper money and conclude with
   offering means for preventing them.

   One of the evils of paper money is, that it turns the whole country into
   stock jobbers. The precariousness of its value and the uncertainty of its
   fate continually operate, night and day, to produce this destructive
   effect. Having no real value in itself it depends for support upon
   accident, caprice and party, and as it is the interest of some to
   depreciate and of others to raise its value, there is a continual
   invention going on that destroys the morals of the country.

   It was horrid to see, and hurtful to recollect, how loose the principles
   of justice were left, by means of the paper emissions during the war. The
   experience then had, should be a warning to any assembly how they venture
   to open such a dangerous door again.

   As to the romantic, if not hypocritical, tale that a virtuous people need
   no gold and silver, and that paper will do as well, it requires no other
   contradiction than the experience we have seen. Though some well-meaning
   people may be inclined to view it in this light, it is certain that the
   sharper always talks this language.

   There are a set of men who go about making purchases upon credit, and
   buying estates they have not wherewithal to pay for; and having done this,
   their next step is to fill the newspapers with paragraphs of the scarcity
   of money and the necessity of a paper emission, then to have a legal
   tender under the pretense of supporting its credit, and when out, to
   depreciate it as fast as they can, get a deal of it for a little price,
   and cheat their creditors; and this is the concise history of paper money
   schemes.

   But why, since the universal custom of the world has established money as
   the most convenient medium of traffic and commerce, should paper be set up
   in preference to gold and silver? The productions of nature are surely as
   innocent as those of art; and in the case of money, are abundantly, if not
   infinitely, more so. The love of gold and silver may produce covetousness,
   but covetousness, when not connected with dishonesty, is not properly a
   vice. It is frugality run to an extreme.

   But the evils of paper money have no end. Its uncertain and fluctuating
   value is continually awakening or creating new schemes of deceit. Every
   principle of justice is put to the rack, and the bond of society
   dissolved: the suppression, therefore, of paper money might very properly
   have been put into the act for preventing vice and immorality.

   The pretense for paper money has been, that there was not a sufficiency of
   gold and silver. This, so far from being a reason for paper emissions, is
   a reason against them.

   As gold and silver are not the productions of North America, they are,
   therefore, articles of importation; and if we set up a paper manufactory
   of money it amounts, as far as it is able, to prevent the importation of
   hard money, or to send it out again as fast it comes in; and by following
   this practice we shall continually banish the specie, till we have none
   left, and be continually complaining of the grievance instead of remedying
   the cause.

   Considering gold and silver as articles of importation, there will in
   time, unless we prevent it by paper emissions, be as much in the country
   as the occasions of it require, for the same reasons there are as much of
   other imported articles. But as every yard of cloth manufactured in the
   country occasions a yard the less to be imported, so it is by money, with
   this difference, that in the one case we manufacture the thing itself and
   in the other we do not. We have cloth for cloth, but we have only paper
   dollars for silver ones.

   As to the assumed authority of any assembly in making paper money, or
   paper of any kind, a legal tender, or in other language, a compulsive
   payment, it is a most presumptuous attempt at arbitrary power. There can
   be no such power in a republican government: the people have no freedom,
   and property no security where this practice can be acted: and the
   committee who shall bring in a report for this purpose, or the member who
   moves for it, and he who seconds it merits impeachment, and sooner or
   later may expect it.

   Of all the various sorts of base coin, paper money is the basest. It has
   the least intrinsic value of anything that can be put in the place of gold
   and silver. A hobnail or a piece of wampum far exceeds it. And there would
   be more propriety in making those articles a legal tender than to make
   paper so.

   It was the issuing base coin, and establishing it as a tender, that was
   one of the principal means of finally overthrowing the power of the Stuart
   family in Ireland. The article is worth reciting as it bears such a
   resemblance to the process practised in paper money.

   Brass and copper of the basest kind, old cannon, broken bells, household
   utensils were assiduously collected; and from every pound weight of such
   vile materials, valued at four pence, pieces were coined and circulated to
   the amount of five pounds normal value. By the first proclamation they
   were made current in all payments to and from the King and the subjects of
   the realm, except in duties on the importation of foreign goods, money
   left in trust, or due by mortgage, bills or bonds; and James promised that
   when the money should be decried, he would receive it in all payments, or
   make full satisfaction in gold and silver. The nominal value was
   afterwards raised by subsequent proclamations, the original restrictions
   removed, and this base money was ordered to be received in all kinds of
   payments. As brass and copper grew scarce, it was made of still viler
   materials, of tin and pewter, and old debts of one thousand pounds were
   discharged by pieces of vile metal amounting to thirty shillings in
   intrinsic value. (Leland's "History of Ireland," vol. IV. p. 265.-Author.)

   Had King James thought of paper, he needed not to have been at the trouble
   or expense of collecting brass and copper, broken bells, and household
   utensils.

   The laws of a country ought to be the standard of equity, and calculated
   to impress on the minds of the people the moral as well as the legal
   obligations of reciprocal justice. But tender laws, of any kind, operate
   to destroy morality, and to dissolve, by the pretense of law, what ought
   to be the principle of law to support, reciprocal justice between man and
   man: and the punishment of a member who should move for such a law ought
   to be death.

   When the recommendation of Congress, in the year 1780, for repealing the
   tender laws was before the Assembly of Pennsylvania, on casting up the
   votes, for and against bringing in a bill to repeal those laws, the
   numbers were equal, and the casting vote rested on the Speaker, Colonel
   Bayard. "I give my vote," said he, "for the repeal, from a consciousness
   of justice; the tender laws operate to establish iniquity by law." But
   when the bill was brought in, the House rejected it, and the tender laws
   continued to be the means of fraud.

   If anything had, or could have, a value equal to gold and silver, it would
   require no tender law: and if it had not that value it ought not to have
   such a law; and, therefore, all tender laws are tyrannical and unjust, and
   calculated to support fraud and oppression.

   Most of the advocates for tender laws are those who have debts to
   discharge, and who take refuge in such a law, to violate their contracts
   and cheat their creditors. But as no law can warrant the doing an unlawful
   act, therefore the proper mode of proceeding, should any such laws be
   enacted in future, will be to impeach and execute the members who moved
   for and seconded such a bill, and put the debtor and the creditor in the
   same situation they were in, with respect to each other, before such a law
   was passed. Men ought to be made to tremble at the idea of such a
   bare-faced act of injustice. It is in vain to talk of restoring credit, or
   complain that money cannot be borrowed at legal interest, until every idea
   of tender laws is totally and publicly reprobated and extirpated from
   among us.

   As to paper money, in any light it can be viewed, it is at best a bubble.
   Considered as property, it is inconsistent to suppose that the breath of
   an assembly, whose authority expires with the year, can give to paper the
   value and duration of gold. They cannot even engage that the next assembly
   shall receive it in taxes. And by the precedent (for authority there is
   none), that one assembly makes paper money, another may do the same, until
   confidence and credit are totally expelled, and all the evils of
   depreciation acted over again. The amount, therefore, of paper money is
   this, that it is the illegitimate offspring of assemblies, and when their
   year expires, they leave a vagrant on the hands of the public.

   Having now gone through the three subjects proposed in the title to this
   work, I shall conclude with offering some thoughts on the present affairs
   of the state.

   My idea of a single legislature was always founded on a hope, that
   whatever personal parties there might be in the state, they would all
   unite and agree in the general principles of good government-that these
   party differences would be dropped at the threshold of the state house,
   and that the public good, or the good of the whole, would be the governing
   principle of the legislature within it.

   Party dispute, taken on this ground, would only be, who should have the
   honor of making the laws; not what the laws should be. But when party
   operates to produce party laws, a single house is a single person, and
   subject to the haste, rashness and passion of individual sovereignty. At
   least, it is an aristocracy.

   The form of the present Constitution is now made to trample on its
   principles, and the constitutional members are anti-constitutional
   legislators. They are fond of supporting the form for the sake of the
   power, and they dethrone the principle to display the sceptre.

   The attack of the late Assembly on the bank, discovers such a want of
   moderation and prudence, of impartiality and equity, of fair and candid
   inquiry and investigation, of deliberate and unbiased judgment, and such a
   rashness of thinking and vengeance of power, as is inconsistent with the
   safety of the republic. It was judging without hearing, and executing
   without trial.

   By such rash, injudicious and violent proceedings, the interest of the
   state is weakened, its prosperity diminished, and its commerce and its
   specie banished to other places. Suppose the bank had not been in an
   immediate condition to have stood such a sudden attack, what a scene of
   instant distress would the rashness of that Assembly have brought upon
   this city and State. The holders of bank notes, whoever they might be,
   would have been thrown into the utmost confusion and difficulties. It is
   no apology to say the House never thought of this, for it was their duty
   to have thought of everything.

   But by the prudent and provident management of the bank (though
   unsuspicious of the attack), it was enabled to stand the run upon it
   without stopping payment a moment, and to prevent the evils and mischiefs
   taking place which the rashness of the Assembly had a direct tendency to
   bring on; a trial that scarcely a bank in Europe, under a similar
   circumstance, could have withstood.

   I cannot see reason sufficient to believe that the hope of the House to
   put down the bank was placed on the withdrawing the charter, so much as on
   the expectation of producing a bankruptcy of the bank, by starting a run
   upon it. If this was any part of their project it was a very wicked one,
   because hundreds might have been ruined to gratify a party spleen.

   But this not being the case, what has the attack amounted to, but to
   expose the weakness and rashness, the want of judgment as well as justice,
   of those who made it, and to confirm the credit of the bank more
   substantially than it was before?

   The attack, it is true, has had one effect, which is not in the power of
   the Assembly to remedy; it has banished many thousand hard dollars from
   the State. By means of the bank, Pennsylvania had the use of a great deal
   of hard money belonging to citizens of other states, and that without any
   interest, for it laid here in the nature of deposit, the depositors taking
   bank notes in its stead. But the alarm called those notes in and the
   owners drew out their cash.

   The banishing the specie served to make room for the paper money of the
   Assembly and we have now paper dollars where we might have had silver
   ones. So that the effect of the paper money has been to make less money in
   the state than there was before. Paper money is like dram-drinking, it
   relieves for a moment by deceitful sensation, but gradually diminishes the
   natural heat, and leaves the body worse than it found it. Were not this
   the case, and could money be made of paper at pleasure, every sovereign in
   Europe would be as rich as he pleased. But the truth is, that it is a
   bubble and the attempt vanity. Nature has provided the proper materials
   for money, gold and silver, and any attempt of ours to rival her is
   ridiculous.

   But to conclude. If the public will permit the opinion of a friend who is
   attached to no party, and under obligation to none, nor at variance with
   any, and who through a long habit of acquaintance with them has never
   deceived them, that opinion shall be freely given.

   The bank is an institution capable of being made exceedingly beneficial to
   the State, not only as the means of extending and facilitating its
   commerce, but as a means of increasing the quantity of hard money in the
   State. The Assembly's paper money serves directly to banish or crowd out
   the hard, because it is issued as money and put in the place of hard
   money. But bank notes are of a very different kind, and produce a contrary
   effect. They are promissory notes payable on demand, and may be taken to
   the bank and exchanged for gold or silver without the least ceremony or
   difficulty.

   The bank, therefore, is obliged to keep a constant stock of hard money
   sufficient for this purpose; which is what the Assembly neither does, nor
   can do by their paper; because the quantity of hard money collected by
   taxes into the treasury is trifling compared with the quantity that
   circulates in trade and through the bank.

   The method, therefore, to increase the quantity of hard money would be to
   combine the security of the government and the bank into one. And instead
   of issuing paper money that serves to banish the specie, to borrow the sum
   wanted of the bank in bank notes, on the condition of the bank exchanging
   those notes at stated periods and quantities, with hard money.

   Paper issued in this manner, and directed to this end, would, instead of
   banishing, work itself into gold and silver; because it will then be both
   the advantage and duty of the bank and of all the mercantile interests
   connected with it, to procure and import gold and silver from any part of
   the world, to give in exchange for the notes. The English Bank is
   restricted to the dealing in no other articles of importation than gold
   and silver, and we may make the same use of our bank if we proceed
   properly with it.

   Those notes will then have a double security, that of the government and
   that of the bank: and they will not be issued as money, but as hostages to
   be exchanged for hard money, and will, therefore, work the contrary way to
   what the paper of the assembly, uncombined with the security of the bank,
   produces: and the interest allowed the bank will be saved to the
   government, by a saving of the expenses and charged attending paper
   emissions.

   It is, as I have already observed in the course of this work, the harmony
   of all the parts of a republic, that constitutes their several and mutual
   good. A government that is constructed only to govern, is not a republican
   government. It is combining authority with usefulness, that in a great
   measure distinguishes the republican system from others.

   Paper money appears, at first sight, to be a great saving, or rather that
   it costs nothing; but it is the dearest money there is. The ease with
   which it is emitted by an assembly at first, serves as a trap to catch
   people in at last. It operates as an anticipation of the next year's
   taxes. If the money depreciates, after it is out, it then, as I have
   already remarked, has the effect of fluctuating stock, and the people
   become stock-jobbers to throw the loss on each other.

   If it does not depreciate, it is then to be sunk by taxes at the price of
   hard money; because the same quantity of produce, or goods, that would
   procure a paper dollar to pay taxes with, would procure a silver one for
   the same purpose. Therefore, in any case of paper money, it is dearer to
   the country than hard money, by all the expense which the paper, printing,
   signing, and other attendant charges come to, and at last goes into the
   fire.

   Suppose one hundred thousand dollars in paper money to be emitted every
   year by the assembly, and the same sum to be sunk every year by taxes,
   there will then be no more than one hundred thousand dollars out at any
   one time. If the expense of paper and printing, and of persons to attend
   the press while the sheets are striking off, signers, etc., be five per
   cent, it is evident that in the course of twenty years' emissions, the one
   hundred thousand dollars will cost the country two hundred thousand
   dollars. Because the papermaker's and printer's bills, and the expense of
   supervisors and signers, and other attendant charges, will in that time
   amount to as much as the money amounts to; for the successive emissions
   are but a re-coinage of the same sum.

   But gold and silver require to be coined but once, and will last an
   hundred years, better than paper will one year, and at the end of that
   time be still gold and silver. Therefore, the saving to government, in
   combining its aid and security with that of the bank in procuring hard
   money, will be an advantage to both, and to the whole community.

   The case to be provided against, after this, will be, that the Government
   do not borrow too much of the bank, nor the bank lend more notes than it
   can redeem; and, therefore, should anything of this kind be undertaken,
   the best way will be to begin with a moderate sum, and observe the effect
   of it. The interest given the bank operates as a bounty on the importation
   of hard money, and which may not be more than the money expended in making
   paper emissions.

   But nothing of this kind, nor any other public undertaking, that requires
   security and duration beyond the year, can be gone upon under the present
   mode of conducting government. The late Assembly, by assuming a sovereign
   power over every act and matter done by the State in former assemblies,
   and thereby setting up a precedent of over- hauling, and overturning, as
   the accident of elections shall happen or party prevail, have rendered
   government incompetent to all the great objects of the state. They have
   eventually reduced the public to an annual body like themselves; whereas
   the public are a standing, permanent body, holding annual elections.

   There are several great improvements and undertakings, such as inland
   navigation, building bridges, opening roads of communication through the
   state, and other matters of a public benefit, that might be gone upon, but
   which now cannot, until this governmental error or defect is remedied. The
   faith of government, under the present mode of conducting it, cannot be
   relied on. Individuals will not venture their money in undertakings of
   this kind, on an act that may be made by one assembly and broken by
   another.

   When a man can say that he cannot trust the government, the importance and
   dignity of the public is diminished, sapped and undermined; and,
   therefore, it becomes the public to restore their own honor by setting
   these matters to rights.

   Perhaps this cannot be effectually done until the time of the next
   convention, when the principles, on which they are to be regulated and
   fixed, may be made a part of the constitution.

   In the meantime the public may keep their affairs in sufficient good
   order, by substituting prudence in the place of authority, and electing
   men into the government, who will at once throw aside the narrow
   prejudices of party, and make the good of the whole the ruling object of
   their conduct. And with this hope, and a sincere wish for their
   prosperity, I close my book.

   Footnotes

   1 - This pledge and compact is contained in the declaration of rights
   prefixed to the constitution (of Pennsylvania), and is as follows:

   I. That all men are born 'equally free and independent, and have certain
   natural, inherent and unalienable rights, amongst which are, the enjoying
   and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting
   property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.

   II. That all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship Almighty
   God, according to the dictates of their own consciences and understanding:
   and that no man ought or of right can be compelled to attend any religious
   worship, or erect or support any place of worship, or maintain any
   ministry, contrary to, or against his own free will and consent: nor can
   any man, who acknowledges the being of a God, be justly deprived or
   abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious
   sentiments or peculiar mode of religious worship: and that no authority
   can or ought to be vested in, or assumed by, any power whatever, that
   shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner control, the right of
   conscience in the free exercise of religious worship.

   III. That the people of this State have the sole, exclusive and inherent
   right of governing and regulating the internal police of the same.

   IV. That all power being originally inherent in, and consequently derived
   from, the people; therefore, all officers of government, whether
   legislative or executive, are their trustees and servants, and at all
   times accountable to them.

   V. That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit,
   protection and security of the people, nation or community; and not for
   the particular emolument or advantage of any single man, family, or set of
   men, who are a part only of that community; and that the community hath an
   indubitable, unalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or
   abolish government in such manner as shall be by that community judged
   most conducive to the public weal.

   VI. That those who are employed in the legislative and executive business
   of the state may be restrained from oppression, the people have a right,
   at such periods as they may think proper to reduce their public officers
   to a private station, and supply the vacancies by certain and regular
   elections.

   VII. That all elections ought to be free; and that all free men having a
   sufficient evident common interest with, and attachment to the community,
   have a right to elect officers, or to be elected into office.

   VIII. That every member of society hath a right to be protected in the
   enjoyment the security to the rich and the consolation to the poor is,
   that what each man has is his own; that no despotic sovereign can take it
   from him, and that the common cementing principle which holds all the
   parts of a republic together, secures him likewise from the despotism of
   numbers: for despotism may be more effectually acted by many over a few,
   than by one man over all. of life, liberty and property, and therefore is
   bound to contribute his proportion toward the expense of that protection,
   and yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent thereto;
   but no part of a man's property can be justly taken from him, or applied
   to public uses, without his own consent, or that of his legal
   representatives; nor can any man who is conscientiously scrupulous of
   bearing arms, be justly compelled thereto, if he will pay such equivalent;
   nor are the people bound by any laws, but such as they have in like manner
   assented to, for their common good.

   IX. That in all prosecutions for criminal offenses, a man hath a right to
   be heard

   by himself and his counsel, to demand the cause and nature of his
   accusation, to be con- fronted with the witnesses, to call for evidence in
   his favor, and a speedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the country,
   without the unanimous consent of which jury he cannot be found guilty; nor
   can he be compelled to give evidence against himself; nor can any man be
   justly deprived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the
   judgment of his peers.

   X. That the people have a right to hold themselves, their houses, papers,
   and possessions free from search and seizure; and therefore warrants
   without oaths or affirmations, first made, affording a sufficient
   foundation for them, and whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded
   or required to search suspected places, or to seize any person or persons,
   his or their property, not particularly described, are contrary to that
   right, and ought not to be granted.

   XI. That in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man
   and man, the parties have a right to trial by jury, which ought to be held
   sacred.

   XII. That the people have a right to freedom of speech, and of writing and
   publishing their sentiments; therefore the freedom of the press ought not
   to be restrained.

   XIII. That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of
   themselves and the state-and as standing armies, in the time of peace, are
   dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up-and that the military
   should be kept under a strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil
   power.

   XIV. That a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles, and a firm
   adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, industry and frugality are
   absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty and keep a
   government free-the people ought therefore to pay particular attention to
   these points in the choice of officers and representatives, and have a
   right to exact a due and constant regard to them, from their legislators
   and magistrates, in the making and executing such laws as are necessary
   for the good government of the state.

   XV. That all men have a natural inherent right to emigrate from one state
   to another that will receive them, or to form a new state in vacant
   countries, or in such countries as they can purchase, whenever they think
   that thereby they may promote their own happiness.

   XVI. That the people have a right to assemble together, to consult for
   their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to the
   Legislature for redress or grievances, by address, petition, or
   remonstrance.-Author.

    

   2 - Minutes of the Assembly, March 21, 1785. Petitions from a considerable
   number of the inhabitants of Chester County were read, representing that
   the bank established at Philadelphia has fatal effects upon the community;
   that whilst men are enabled, by means of the bank, to receive near three
   times the rate of common interest, and at the same time receive their
   money at very short warning, whenever they have occasion for it, it will
   be impossible for the husbandman or mechanic to borrow on the former terms
   of legal interest and distant payments of the principal; that the best
   security will not enable the person to borrow; that experience clearly
   demonstrates the mischievous consequences of this institution to the fair
   trader; that impostors have been enabled to support themselves in a
   fictitious credit, by means of a temporary punctuality at the bank, until
   they have drawn in their honest neighbors to trust them with their
   property, or to pledge their credit as sureties, and have been finally
   involved in ruin and distress.

   That they have repeatedly seen the stopping of discounts at the bank
   operate on the trading part of the community, with a degree of violence
   scarcely inferior to that of a stagnation of the blood in the human body,
   hurrying the wretched merchant who hath debts to pay into the hands of
   griping usurers; that the directors of the bank may give such preference
   in trade, by advances of money, to their particular favorites, as to
   destroy that equality which ought to prevail in a commercial country; that
   paper money has often proved beneficial to the state, but the bank forbids
   it, and the people must acquiesce; therefore, and in order to restore
   public confidence and private security, they pray that a bill may be
   brought in and passed into a law for repealing the law for incorporating
   the bank.

   March 28. The report of the committee, read March 25, on the petitions
   from the counties of Chester and Berks, and the city of Philadelphia and
   its vicinity, praying the act of the Assembly, whereby the bank was
   established at Philadelphia, may be repealed, was read the second time as
   follows-viz.

   The committee to whom was referred the petitions concerning the bank
   established at Philadelphia, and who were instructed to inquire whether
   the said bank be compatible with the public safety, and that equality
   which ought ever to prevail between the individuals of a republic, beg
   leave to report, that it is the opinion of this committee that the said
   bank, as at present established, is in every view incompatible with the
   public safety-that in the present state of our trade, the said bank has a
   direct tendency to banish a great part of the specie from the country, so
   as to produce a scarcity of money, and to collect into the hands of the
   stockholders of the said bank, almost the whole of the money which remains
   amongst us.

   That the accumulation of enormous wealth in the hands of a society, who
   claim perpetual duration, will necessarily produce a degree of influence
   and power, which cannot be entrusted in the hands of any set of men
   whatsoever, without endangering the public safety. That the said bank, in
   its corporate capacity, is empowered to hold estates to the amount of ten
   millions of dollars, and by the tenor of the present charter, is to exist
   forever, without being obliged to yield any emolument to the government,
   or to be at all dependent upon it. That the great profits of the bank
   which will daily increase as money grows scarcer, and which already far
   exceed the profits of European banks, have tempted foreigners to vest
   their money in this bank, and thus to draw from us large sums for
   interest.

   That foreigners will doubtless be more and more induced to become
   stockholders, until the time may arrive when this enormous engine of power
   may become subject to foreign influence; this country may be agitated with
   the politics of European courts, and the good people of America reduced
   once more into a state of subordination, and dependence upon some one or
   other of the European powers. That at best, if it were even confined to
   the hands of Americans, it would be totally destructive of that equality
   which ought to prevail in a republic.

   We have nothing in our free and equal government capable of balancing the
   influence which this bank must create-and we see nothing which in the
   course of a few years, can prevent the directors of the bank from
   governing Pennsylvania. Already we have felt its influence indirectly
   interfering in the measures of the legislature. Already the House of
   Assembly, the representatives of the people, have been threatened, that
   the credit of our paper currency will be blasted by the bank; and if this
   growing evil continues, we fear the time is not very distant, when the
   bank will be able to dictate to the legislature, what laws to pass and
   what to forbear.

   Your committee therefore beg leave to further report the following
   resolution to be adopted by the House-viz.:

   Resolved, that a committee be appointed to bring in a bill to repeal the
   act of Assembly  passed the first day of April, 1782, entitled, "An act to
   incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of North America": and also to
   repeal one other act of Assembly, passed the eighteenth of March, 1782,
   entitled, "An act for preventing and punishing the counterfeiting of the
   common seal, bank bills and bank notes of the president, directors and
   company, of the Bank of North America, and for the other purposes therein
   mentioned."-Author.

   3 - The petitions say, "That they have frequently seen the stopping of
   discounts at the bank operate on the trading part of the community, with a
   degree of violence scarcely inferior to that of a stagnation of the blood
   in the human body, hurrying the wretched merchant who hath debts to pay
   into the hands of griping usurers."

   As the persons who say or signed this live somewhere in Chester County,
   they are not, from situation, certain of what they say. Those petitions
   have every appearance of being contrived for the purpose of bringing the
   matter on. The petitions and the report have strong evidence in them of
   being both drawn by the same person: for the report is as clearly the echo
   of the petitions as ever the address of the British Parliament was the
   echo of the King's speech.

   Besides the reason I have already given for occasionally stopping
   discounting notes at the bank, there are other necessary reasons. It is
   for the purpose of settling accounts; short reckonings make long friends.
   The bank lends its money for short periods, and by that means assists a
   great many different people: and if it did not sometimes stop discounting
   as a means of settling with the persons it has already lent its money to,
   those persons would find a way to keep what they had borrowed longer than
   they ought, and prevent others being assisted. It is a fact, and some of
   the committee know it to be so, that sundry of those persons who then
   opposed the bank acted this part.

   The stopping the discounts do not, and cannot, operate to call in the
   loans sooner than the time for which they were lent, and therefore the
   charge is false that "it hurries men into the hands of griping usurers":
   and the truth is that it operates to keep them from them.

   If petitions are to be contrived to cover the design of a house of
   assembly, and give a pretense for its conduct, or if a house is to be led
   by the nose by the idle tale of any fifty or sixty signers to a petition,
   it is time for the public to look a little closer into the conduct of its
   representatives.-Author.
