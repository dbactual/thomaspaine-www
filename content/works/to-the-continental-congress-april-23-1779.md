   To the Continental Congress  April 23, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   On inquiring yesterday of Mr. Thomson, your Secretary, I find that no
   answer is given to any of my letters. I am unable to account for the
   seeming inattention of Congress in collecting information at this
   particular time, from whatever quarter it may come; and this wonder is the
   more increased when I recollect that a private offer was made to me, about
   three months ago, amounting in money to -L-700 a year; yet however polite
   the proposal might be, or however friendly it might be designed, I thought
   it my duty to decline it; as it was accompanied with a condition which I
   conceived had a tendency to prevent the information I have since given,
   and shall yet give to the country on public affairs.

   I have repeatedly wrote to Congress respecting Mr. Deane's dark incendiary
   conduct, and offered every information in my power. The opportunities I
   have had of knowing the state of foreign affairs is greater than that of
   many gentlemen of this House, and I want no other knowledge to declare
   that I look on Mr. Deane to be, what Mr. Carmichael calls him, a rascal.
   Whether Mr. Deane was encouraged by members of this Honorable House to
   traduce the characters of the rest of the Commissioners to make room for
   themselves, and to establish a commercial company calculated to monopolize
   the trade of the country is what I have not authority to say, but the
   appearance of things together with some knowledge I am possessed of too
   much justify the suspicion.

   THOS. PAINE.

   P. S. The enclosed is part of an original letter which was sent to me
   about a month ago, and if it be of any use to Congress I offer it for
   their consideration. I never corresponded with the writer, neither have I
   yet answered it.

   T. P.

   I shall be obliged to any of the Pennsylvania delegates that will return
   the enclosed to me.
