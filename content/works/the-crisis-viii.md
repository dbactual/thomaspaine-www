   THE CRISIS. No. VIII.
   
   from the *Pennsylvania Packet*, February 26, 1780.

   Addressed to the People of ENGLAND, by the Author of COMMON SENSE.

   "TRUSTING, (says the king of England in his speech of November last) in
   the Divine Providence, and in the justice of my cause, I am firmly
   resolved to prosecute the war with vigor, and to make every exertion in
   order to compel our enemies to equitable terms of peace and
   accommodation." To this declaration the United States of America and the
   Confederated Powers of Europe, will reply, *If Britain will have war, she
   shall have enough of it.*

   Five years have nearly elapsed since the commencement of hostilities, and
   every campaign, by a gradual decay, has lessened your ability to conquer,
   without producing a serious thought on your condition or your fate. Like a
   prodigal lingering in an habitual consumption, you feel the relicks of
   life and mistake them for recovery. New schemes, like new medicines, have
   administered fresh hopes and prolonged the disease instead of curing it.
   A change of Generals, like a change of physicians, served only to keep the
   flattery alive, and furnish new pretences for new extravagance.

   "*Can Britain fail?*" (1) Has been proudly asked at the undertaking of every
   enterprize, and that "whatever she wills is fate*,"(2) has been given with
   the solemnity of prophetic confidence, and tho' the question has been
   constantly replied to by disappointment, and the prediction falsified by
   misfortune, yet still the insult continued, and your catalogue of national
   evils encreased therewith. Eager to persuade the world of her power, she
   considered destruction as the minister of greatness, and conceived that
   the glory of a nation, like that of an Indian, lay in the number
   of its scalps and the miseries which it inflicts.

      University of Oxford.

   Fire, sword and want, as far as the arms of Britain could extend them,
   have been spread with wanton cruelty along the coast of America; and while
   you, remote from the scene of suffering, had nothing to lose and as little
   to dread, the information reached you like a tale of antiquity, in which
   the distance of time defaces the conception, and changes the severest
   sorrows into conversable amusement.

   This makes the second paper, addressed perhaps in vain, to the people of
   England. That advice should be taken wherever example has failed, or
   precept be regarded where warning is ridiculed, is like a picture of hope
   resting on despair: But when time shall stamp with universal currency, the
   facts you have long encountered with a laugh, and the irresistible
   evidence of accumulated losses, like the hand writing on the wall, shall
   add terror to distress, you will then, in a conflict of sufferings, learn
   to sympathise with others by feeling for yourselves.

   The triumphant appearance of the combined fleets in the channel and at
   your harbour's mouth, and the expedition of Captain Paul Jones on the
   western and eastern coasts of England and Scotland, will, by placing you
   in the condition of an endangered country, read to you a stronger lecture
   on the calamities of invasion, and bring to your minds a truer picture of
   promiscuous distress, than the most finished rhetoric can describe or the
   keenest imagination conceive.

   Hitherto you have experienced the expenses, but nothing of the miseries of
   war. Your disappointments have been accompanied with no immediate
   suffering, and your losses came to you only by intelligence. Like fire at
   a distance you heard not even the cry; you felt not the danger, you saw
   not the confusion. To you every thing has been foreign but the taxes to
   support it. You knew not what it was to be alarmed at midnight with an
   armed enemy in the streets. You were strangers to the distressing scene of
   a family in flight, and to the thousand restless cares and tender sorrows
   that incessantly arose. To see women and children wandering in the
   severity of winter with the broken remains of a well furnished house, and
   seeking shelter in every crib and hut, were matters that you had no
   conception of. You knew not what it was to stand by and see your goods
   chopt for fuel, and your beds ript to pieces to make packages for
   plunder. The misery of others, like a tempestuous night, added to the
   pleasures of your own security. You even enjoyed the storm, by
   contemplating the difference of conditions; and that which carried sorrow
   into the breasts of thousands, served but to heighten in you a species of
   tranquil pride. &mdash; Yet these are but the fainter sufferings of war, when
   compared with carnage and slaughter, the miseries of a military hospital,
   or a town in flames.

   The people of America by anticipating distress had fortified their minds
   against every species you could inflict. They had resolved to abandon
   their homes, to resign them to destruction, and to seek new settlements
   rather than submit. Thus familiarised to misfortune, before it arrived,
   they bore their portion with the less regret: The justness of their cause
   was a continual source of consolation, and the hope of final victory,
   which never left them, served to lighten the load and sweeten the cup
   allotted them to drink.

   But when their sufferings shall become yours, and invasion be transferred
   upon the invaders, you will have neither their extended wilderness to fly
   to, their cause to comfort you, nor their hope to rest on. Distress with
   them was sharpened by no self-reflection. They had not brought it on
   themselves. On the contrary, they had by every proceeding endeavoured to
   avoid it, and had descended even below the mark of congressional
   character, to prevent a war. The national honor or the advantages of
   independence were matters, which at the commencement of the dispute, they
   had never studied, and it was only at the last moment that the measure was
   resolved on. Thus circumstanced, they naturally and conscientiously felt a
   dependence upon Providence. They had a clear pretension to it, and had
   they failed therein, infidelity had gained a triumph.

   But your condition is the reverse of theirs. Every thing you suffer you
   have sought: nay, had you created mischiefs on purpose to inherit them,
   you could not have secured your title by a firmer deed. The world awakens
   with no pity at your complaints. You felt none for others; you deserve
   none for yourselves. Nature does not interest herself in cases like yours,
   but on the contrary turns from them with dislike, and abandons them to
   punishment. You may now present memorials to what Court you please, but so
   far as America is the object, none will listen. The policy of Europe and
   the propensity there in every mind to curb insulting ambition, and bring
   cruelty to judgment, are unitedly against you; and where nature and
   interest reinforce with each other, the compact is too intimate to be
   dissolved.

   Make but the case of others your own, and your own theirs, and you will
   then have a clear idea of the whole. Had France acted towards her Colonies
   as you have done, you would have branded her with every epithet of
   abhorrence; and had you, like her, stept in to succour a struggling
   people, all Europe must have echoed with your own applauses. But entangled
   in the passion of dispute, you see it not as you ought, and form opinions
   thereon which suit with no interest but your own. You wonder that America
   does not rise in union with you to impose on herself a portion of your
   taxes and reduce herself to unconditional submission. You are amazed that
   the Southern Powers of Europe do not assist you in conquering a country
   which is afterwards to be turned against themselves; and that the northern
   ones do not contribute to reinstate you in America, who already enjoy the
   market for naval stores by the separation. You seem surprised that Holland
   does not pour in her succors to maintain you mistress of the seas, when
   her own commerce is suffering by your Act of navigation, or that any
   country should study her own interest while yours is on the carpet.

   Such excesses of passionate folly, and unjust as well as unwise
   resentment, have driven you on, like Pharoah, to unpitied miseries, and
   while the importance of the quarrel shall perpetuate your disgrace, the
   flag of America will carry it round the world. The natural feelings of
   every rational being will take against you, and wherever the story shall be
   told, you will have neither excuse nor consolation left. With an unsparing
   hand and an insatiable mind, you have havocked the world, both to gain
   dominion and to lose it, and while, in a frenzy of avarice and ambition,
   the east and west are doomed to tributary bondage, you rapidly earned
   destruction as the wages of a nation.

   At the thoughts of a war at home every man amongst you ought to tremble.
   The prospect is far more dreadful there than in America. Here the party
   that was against the measures of the continent were in general composed of
   a kind of neutrals who added strength to neither army. There does not
   exist a being so devoid of sense and sentiment as to covet "*unconditional
   submission,*" and therefore no man in America could be with you in
   principle. Several might from a cowardice of mind, *prefe*r it to the
   hardships and dangers of *opposing* it; but the same disposition that gave
   them such a choice, unfitted them to act either for or against. But
   England is rent into parties, with equal shares of resolution. The
   principle which produced the war, divides the nation. Their animosities are
   in the highest state of fermentation, and both sides by a call of the
   militia, are in arms. No human foresight can discern, no conclusion can be
   formed, what turn a war might take, if once set on foot by an invasion.
   She is not now in a fit disposition to make a common cause of her own
   affairs, and having no conquests to hope for abroad, and nothing but
   expenses arising at home, her every thing is staked upon a defensive
   combat, and the further she goes the worse she is off.

   There are situations that a nation may be in, in which peace or war,
   abstracted from every other consideration, may be politically right or
   wrong. When nothing can be lost by a war, but what must be lost without
   it, war is then the policy of that country; and such was the situation of
   America at the commencement of hostilities: But when no security can be
   gained by a war, but what may be accomplished by a peace, the case becomes
   reversed, and such now is the situation of England.

   That America is beyond the reach of conquest, is a fact which experience
   has shewn and time confirmed, and this admitted, what, I ask, is now the
   object of contention? If there be any honor in pursuing self-destruction
   with inflexible passion; if national suicide be the perfection of national
   glory, you may, with all the pride of criminal happiness, expire unenvied
   and unrivalled. &mdash; But when the tumult of war shall cease, and the tempest of
   present passions be succeeded by calm reflection, or when those who
   surviving its fury, shall inherit from you a legacy of debts and
   misfortunes, when the yearly revenue scarcely be able to discharge the
   interest of the one, and no possible remedy be left for the other; ideas,
   far different from the present, will arise, and embitter the remembrance of
   former follies. A mind disarmed of its rage, feels no pleasure in
   contemplating a frantic quarrel. Sickness of thought, the sure consequence
   of conduct like yours, leaves no ability for enjoyment, no relish for
   resentment; and tho' like a man in a fit, you feel not the injury of
   the struggle, nor distinguish between strength and disease, the weakness
   will nevertheless be proportioned to the violence, and the sense of pain
   encrease with the recovery.

   To what persons or to whose system of politics you owe your present state
   of wretchedness is a matter of total indifference to America. They have
   contributed, however unwillingly, to set her above themselves, and she, in
   the tranquillity of conquest, resigns the enquiry. The case now is not so
   properly who began the war, as who continues it. That there are men in all
   countries to whom a state of war is a mine of wealth, is a fact never to
   be doubted. Characters like these naturally breed in the putrefaction of
   distempered times, and after fattening on the disease they perish with
   it, or impregnated with the stench retreat into obscurity.

   But there are several erroneous notions to which you likewise owe a share
   of your misfortunes, and which if continued will only increase your
   trouble and your losses. An opinion hangs about the gentlemen of the
   minority, that America would relish measures under *their* administration,
   which she would not from the present cabinet. On this rock Lord Chatham
   would have split had he gained the helm, and several of his survivors are
   steering the same course. Such distinctions in the infancy of the argument
   had some degree of foundation, but they now serve no other purpose than to
   lengthen out a war, in which the limits of a dispute, being fixt by the
   fate of arms, and guaranteed by treaties, are not to be changed or altered
   by trivial circumstances.

   The Ministry and many of the minority sacrifice their time in disputing
   on a question with which they have nothing to do, namely, whether America
   shall be independent or not? Whereas the only question that can come under
   their determination, is, whether they will accede to it or not. They
   confound a military question with a political one, and undertake to supply
   by a vote what they lost by a battle. Say, she shall not be independant,
   and it will signify as much as if they voted against a decree of fate, or
   say that she shall, and she will be no more independant than before.
   Questions, which when determined, cannot be executed, serve only to shew
   the folly of dispute and the weakness of disputants.

   From a long habit of calling America your own, you suppose her governed by
   the same prejudices and conceits which govern yourselves. Because you have
   set up a particular denomination of religion to the exclusion of all
   others, you imagine she must do the same, and because you, with an
   unsociable narrowness of mind, have cherished enmity against France and
   Spain, you suppose her alliance must be defective in friendship. Copying
   her notions of the world from you, she formerly thought as you instructed,
   but now feeling herself free, and the prejudice removed, she thinks and
   acts upon a different system. It frequently happens that in proportion as
   we are taught to dislike persons and countries, not knowing why, we feel
   an ardor of esteem upon the removal of the mistake: it seems as if
   something was to be made amends for, and we eagerly give in to every
   office of friendship, to atone for the injury of the error. 
   
   But perhaps 
   there is something in the extent of countries, which, among the generality
   of people, insensibly communicates extension of the mind. The soul of an
   Islander, in its native State, seems bounded by the foggy confines of the
   water's edge, and all beyond, affords to him matters only for profit or
   curiosity, not for friendship. His island is to him his world, and fixt
   to that his every thing centers in it; while those, who are inhabitants of
   a continent, by casting their eye over a larger field, take in likewise a
   larger intellectual circuit, and thus approaching nearer to an
   acquaintance with the universe, their atmosphere of thought is extended,
   and their liberality fills a wider space. In short, our minds seem to be
   measured by countries when we are men, as they are by places when we are
   children, and until something happens to disentangle us from the
   prejudice, we serve under it without perceiving it.

   In addition to this, it may be remarked, that men who study any universal
   science, the principles of which are universally known, or admitted, and
   applied without distinction to the common benefit of all countries, obtain
   thereby a larger share of philanthropy than those who only study national
   arts and improvements. Natural philosophy, mathematics and astronomy,
   carry the mind from the country to the creation, and give it a fitness
   suited to the extent. It was not Newton's honor, neither could it be his
   pride, that he was an Englishman, but that he was a philosopher: The
   Heavens had liberated him from the prejudices of an island, and science
   had expanded his soul as boundless as his studies.
