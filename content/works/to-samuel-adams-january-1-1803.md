   From the original letter at the New York Public Library.

   My dear and venerable friend Samuel Adams

   I received with great pleasure your friendly and affectionate letter of
   November 30 and I thank you also for the frankness of it. Between
   men in pursuit of truth, and whose object is the happiness of man both here
   and hereafter, there ought to be no reserve. Even Error has a claim to
   indulgence, if not respect, when it is believed to be truth.

   I am obliged to you for your affectionate remembrance of what you stile my
   services in awakening the public mind to a declaration of Independence,
   and supporting it after it was declared. I also, like you, have often
   looked back on those times, and have thought that if independence had not
   been declared at the time it was the public mind could not have been
   brought up to it afterwards. It will immediately occur to you, who were so 
   intimately acquainted with
   the situation of things at that time, that I allude to the black times of
   *Seventy-six*; for though I know, and you my friend also know, they were no
   other than the natural consequence of the military blunders of that
   campaign, the country might have viewed them as proceeding from a natural
   inability to support its Cause against the enemy, and have sunk under the
   despondency of that misconceived Idea. This was the impression against
   which it was necessary the Country should be strongly animated.

   I come now to the second part of your letter, on which I shall be as frank
   with you as you are with me.

   "But (say you), when I *heard* you had turned your mind to a defence of
   *Infidelity* I felt myself much astonished &c" - What, my good friend, do
   you call believing in God *infidelity*? for that is the great point
   maintained in the *Age of Reason* against all divided beliefs and
   *allegorical* divinities. The Bishop of Llandaff (Docr Watson) not only
   acknowledges this, but pays me some compliments upon it (in his answer to
   the second part of that work). "*There is* (says he) *a philosophical
   sublimity in some of your ideas when speaking of the Creator of the Universe*." 

   What then (my much esteemed friend for I do not respect you the less
   because we differ, and that perhaps not much in religious sentiment)
   what I ask is this thing called *infidelity*? If we go back to your
   ancestors and mine three or four hundred years ago, for we must have had
   fathers and grandfathers or we should not be here, we shall find them
   praying to Saints and Virgins, and believing in purgatory and
   transubstantiation, and therefore all of us are infidels according to our
   forefathers belief. If we go back to times more ancient we shall again be
   infidels according to the belief of some other fore fathers.

   The case, my friend, is that the World has been over run with fable and
   creeds of human invention; with Sectaries of whole nations against 
   other nations, and sectaries of those sectaries in each of them against
   each other. Every sectary, except the quakers, has been a persecutor.
   Those who fled from persecution, persecuted in their turn, and it is this
   confusion of creeds that has filled the World with persecution and deluged
   it with blood. Even the depredation on your commerce by the barbary powers 
   sprang from the Cruisades of the Church against those powers. It was a war of 
   Creed against Creed, each boasting of God for its author, and reviling each
   other with the name of Infidel. If I do not believe as you believe, it
   proves that you do not believe as I believe, and this is all that it
   proves.

   There is however one point of Union wherein all religions meet, and that
   is, in the first article of every Man's Creed, and of every Nation's Creed,
   that has any creed at all. *I believe in God*. Those who rest here, and
   there are millions who do, cannot be wrong as far as their Creed goes.
   Those who chuse to go further *may be wrong* for it is impossible that all
   can be right since there is so much contradiction among them. The first
   therefore are, in my opinion, on the safest side.

   I presume you are so far acquainted with ecclesiastical history as to
   know, and the bishop who has answered me has been obliged to acknowledge
   the fact, that the books that compose the New Testament were voted by *Yeas*
   and *Nays* to be the Word of God as you now vote a law, by the popish
   Councils of Nice and Laodicea about 1450 
   years ago. With respect to the fact there is no dispute, neither do I
   mention it for the sake of controversy. This Vote may appear authority
   enough to some, and not authority enough to others. It is proper however
   that everybody should know the fact.

   With respect to *The Age of Reason* which you so much condemn, and that I
   believe without having read it, for you say only that you *heard* of it, I
   will inform you of a Circumstance because you cannot know it by other
   means. I have said in the first page of the first part of that work that it had
   long been my intention to publish my thoughts upon religion, but that I
   had reserved it to a later time of life. I have now to inform you why I
   wrote it and published it at the time I did.

   In the first place, I saw my life in continual danger. My friends were
   falling as fast as the guillotine could cut their heads off, and as I
   every day expected the same fate, I resolved to begin my work. I appeared
   to myself to be on my death bed, for death was on every side of me, and I
   had no time to lose. This accounts for my writing it at the time I did;
   and so nicely did the time and the intention meet that I had not finished
   the first part of that Work more than six hours before I was arrested and
   taken to prison. Joel Barlow was with me and knows the fact.

   In the second place, the people of france were running headlong into
   Atheism, and I had the work translated and published in their own language
   to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article (as I have
   before said) of every man's creed who has any creed at all, *I believe in
   God.* I endangered my own life, in the first place, by opposing in the
   Convention the execution of the king, and by labouring to shew they were
   trying the Monarchy and not the Man, and that the crimes imputed to him
   were the crimes of the Monarchical System; and I endangered it a second
   time by opposing Atheism; and yet *some* of your priests, for I do not
   believe that all are perverse, cry out, in the *War-whoop* of Monarchical
   priestcraft, What an Infidel, what a wicked man, is Thomas Paine! They
   might as well add, for he believes in God and is against shedding blood.

   But all this *war-whoop* of the pulpit has some concealed object. Religion
   is not the Cause, but is the stalking horse. They put it forward to
   conceal themselves behind it. It is not a secret that there has been a
   party composed of the leaders of the federalists, for I do not include all
   federalists with their leaders, who have been working by various means for
   several years past to overturn the federal Constitution established on the
   representative system, and place government in the new World on the
   corrupt system of the old. To accomplish this, a large standing Army was 
   necessary, and as a pretense
   for such an Army the danger of a foreign invasion must be bellowed forth
   from the pulpit, from the press, and by their public Orators.
   I am not of a disposition inclined to suspicion. It is in its nature a
   mean and cowardly passion, and upon the whole, even admitting error into
   the case, it is better, I am sure, it is more generous, to be wrong on the
   side of confidence than on the side of suspicion. But I know as a fact
   that the english Government distributes annually fifteen hundred pounds
   sterling among the presbyterian ministers in England and one thousand
   among those of Ireland; and when I hear of the strange discourses of some
   of your ministers and professors of Colleges, I cannot, as the quakers
   say, find freedom in my mind to acquit them. Their anti-revolutionary
   doctrines invite suspicion even against one's will, and in spite of one's
   charity to believe well of them.

   As you have given me one scripture phrase I will give you another for
   those ministers. It is said in Exodus Chap. 22 v28, "*Thou shalt not revile the
   Gods nor curse the ruler of thy people.*" But those ministers such I mean
   as Dr. Emmons curse ruler and people both, for the majority are,
   politically, the people, and it is those who have chosen the ruler whom
   they curse. As to the first part of the verse, that of *not reviling the
   Gods*, it makes no part of my scripture. I have but one God.

   Since I began this letter, for I write it by piece meals, as I have leisure,
   I have seen the four letters that passed between you and John Adams. In
   your first letter you say, "let divines and Philosophers, Statesmen and
   patriots, unite their endeavours to *renovate the age* by inculcating in the
   minds of youth *the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy.*"
   Why, my dear friend, this is exactly *my* religion, and is the whole of it.
   That you may have an Idea that the *Age of Reason* (for I believe you have
   not read it) inculcates this reverential fear and love of the Deity I will
   give you a paragraph from it.

   "Do we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the immensity of the
   Creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom? We see it in the
   unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible Whole is governed. Do we
   want to contemplate his munificence? We see it in the abundance with which
   he fills the Earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We see it in his
   not with holding that abundance even from the unthankful."

   As I am fully with you in your first part, that respecting the Deity, so
   am I in your second, that of *universal philanthropy*; by which I do not
   mean merely the sentimental benevolence of wishing well, but the practical
   benevolence of doing good. We cannot serve the Deity, in the manner we
   serve those who cannot do without that service. He needs no service from
   us. We can add nothing to eternity. But it is in our power to render a
   service *acceptable* to him, and that is not by praying, but by endeavouring
   to make his creatures happy. A man does not serve God when he prays, for it is 
   himself he is trying to
   serve; and as to hiring or paying men to pray, as if the Deity needed
   instruction, it is, in my opinion, an Abomination. One good school-master
   is of more use and of more value than a load of such persons as Dr. Emmons
   and some others.

   You, my dear and much respected friend, are now far in the vale of years;
   I have yet, I believe, some years in store, for I have a good state of
   health and a happy mind, and I take care of both by nourishing the first
   with temperance and the latter with abundance. This, I believe, you will
   allow to be the true philosophy of life. You will see by my third letter to the 
   Citizens of the United States that
   I have been exposed to, and preserved through, many dangers; but instead
   of buffeting the Deity with prayers as if I distrusted him, or must
   dictate to him, I reposed myself on his protection; and you, my friend,
   will find, even in your last moments, more consolation in the silence of
   resignation than in the murmuring wish of a prayer.

   In every thing which you say in your second letter to John Adams,
   respecting our rights as men and Citizens in this World I am perfectly
   with you. On other points we have to answer to our Creator and not to each
   other. The key of heaven is not in the keeping of any Sect, nor ought the
   road to it be obstructed by any.
   Our relation to each other in this World is as men, and the man who is a
   friend to man and to his rights, let his religious opinions be what they
   may, is a good citizen, to whom I can give, as I ought to do, and as every
   other ought, the right hand of fellowship, and to none with more hearty
   good will, my dear friend, than to you.
