Title: To John Inskeep  February 10, 1806

   From the letter in the *Aurora*, Philadelphia, February 10, 1806. 

   To JOHN INSKEEP,
   
   Mayor of the City of Philadelphia.

   I saw in the Aurora of January the 30th a piece addressed to you and
   signed *Isaac Hall*. It contains a statement of your malevolent conduct in
   refusing to let him have Vine street wharf after he had bid fifty dollars
   more rent for it than another person had offered, and had been unanimously
   approved of by the commissioners appointed by law for that purpose. Among
   the reasons given by you for this refusal one was, that "Mr. *Hall was one
   of Paine's disciples.*" If those whom you may chuse to call my disciples
   follow my example in doing good to mankind, they will pass the confines of
   this world with a happy mind, while the hope of the hypocrite shall perish
   and delusion sink into despair.

   I do not know who Mr. Inskeep is, for I do not remember the name of
   Inskeep at Philadelphia in "*the times that tried men's souls.* (1) He must be
   some mushroom of modern growth that has started up on the soil which the
   generous services of Thomas Paine contributed to bless with freedom;
   neither do I know what profession of religion he is of, nor do I care, for
   if he is a man malevolent and unjust, it signifies not to what class or
   sectary he may hypocritically belong.

   As I set too much value on my time to waste it on a man of so little
   consequence as yourself, I will close this short address with a
   declaration that puts hypocrisy and malevolence to defiance. Here it is,
   
   My motive and object in all my political works, beginning with Common
   Sense, the first work I ever published, have been to rescue man from
   tyranny and false systems and false principles of government, and enable
   him to be free, and establish government for himself, and I have borne my
   share of danger in Europe and in America in every attempt I have made for
   this purpose. And my motive and object in all my publications on religious
   subjects, beginning with the first part of the *Age of Reason*, have been to
   bring man to a right reason that God has given him; to impress on him the
   great principles of divine morality, justice, mercy, and a benevolent
   disposition to all men and to all creatures; and to excite in him a spirit
   of trust, confidence, and consolation in his creator, unshackled by the
   fable and fiction of books, by whatever invented name they may be called.
   
   I am happy in the continual contemplation of what I have done, and I thank
   God that he gave me talents for the purpose and fortitude to do it. It
   will make the continual consolation of my departing hours whenever they
   finally arrive.

   THOMAS PAINE.
