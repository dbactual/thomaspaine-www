   To the Honorable Robert Morris, Esqr.  September 20, [1781]

   SECOND STREET,

   SIR,

   As your acquaintance with the finances, your being a member of the House,
   and an inhabitant of the City give you a united knowledge and interest, I
   therefore trouble you with a hint which occurred to me on the reports of
   yesterday.

   I conjecture that one fourth or one third part of the rental of
   Philadelphia will defray the expense of a body of Men sufficient to
   prevent the Enemy from destroying it. I estimate at a guess the-yearly
   rental to be -L-300,000.

   As I need not mention to you to great difference between giving up a
   quarters rent and losing the whole rental together with the Capital, I
   shall therefore make no remarks thereon, the hint I mean to convey is, to
   bring in a provisionary bill for the supply of the City at all times,
   where the destruction of it appears to be the object of the Enemy by
   empowering the tenant to pay immediately into the Treasury one quarters
   rent to be applied as above, and in case it should not be necessary to use
   the money when collected, the same so paid to be considered as part of the
   customary taxes-this all our circumstances considered appears to me the
   readiest and most eligible mode of procuring an immediate supply.

   Your obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
