   From the American Philosophical Society original letter:

   Honored Sir

   I am just now informed by Mr. Bache of a Vessel preparing to Sail for
   London tomorrow, and lest, I should not have another opportunity so soon as
   I might wish, I have taken this, to acquaint you as *laconically* as I can
   of the Service your good favours have been to me, and my Gratitude on that
   account. Even thanks may be rendered troublesome, by being tedious,
   especially to a Gentleman so variously engaged as yourself.

   I did not Sail in the vVssel I first intended, it not having proper
   Conveniences, but in the London Packet, Capt. Cooke. The Exchange was
   much for the Worse. A Putrid Fever broke out among the Servants having an
   120 on board, which tho' not very Fatal, was dismal and dangerous. We
   buried five, and not above that No. escaped the disease. By good
   Providence we had a Dr. on Board, who entered himself as one of the
   Servants, otherwise we must have been in as deplorable a Situation, as a
   Passage of nine Weeks could have rendered us. Two Cabin Passengers escaped
   the Illness owing I believe to their being almost Constantly Sea Sick the
   first three Weeks, I had no Sea Sickness but suffered dreadfully with
   the fever. I had very little hopes that the Capt. or myself would live
   to see America. Dr. Kearsley of this Place, attended the Ship on her
   Arrival, and when he understood that I was on your Recommendation he
   provided a Lodging for me, and sent two of his Men with a Chaise to bring
   me on Shore, for I could not at that Time turn in my bed without help. I
   was six Weeks On Shore before I was well enough to wait on Mr. Beache with
   your favour, but am now thank God perfectly recover'd. I am the more
   particular in mentioning this, lest the scarcity of Vessels which may
   Sail for Philadelphia from London at this Time might induce you to come
   in one of them. I attribute the disease to the Impurity of the Air between
   Decks, and think Ventilation would prevent it, but I am convinced it
   cannot remove the disease, after it has once taken place.

   I observe in Dr. Priestley's late Experiments on Air and your Letter
   thereon, That Vegetation will recover Air rendered noxious by animal
   Substances decaying in it, to its former Purity. Query, Whether it will
   recover Air rendered Impure by *Respiration only*? If it does, it seems to
   indicate that Air either has no Vivifying Spirit, or does not lose it, by
   passing thro' the Lungs, but acts only as a Cleanser, and becomes foul
   by carrying off the filth, i.e., not by what it loses but by what it gains.
   I have not the Treatise by me, and may perhaps have made a useless remark.

   Governor Franklin is removed to Amboy. I have not yet waited on him. Your
   Countenancing me has obtained me many friends and much reputation, for
   which, please to accept my sincere thanks. I have been applied to by
   several Gentlemen to Instruct their Sons, on very advantageous Terms to
   myself. And a Printer and Bookseller here, a Man of Reputation, and
   Property, (Robt. Aitken) has lately attempted a Magazine, but having
   little or no turn that Way himself has applied to me for assistance. He
   had not above 600 Subscribers when I first assisted him. We have now
   upwards of 1500, and daily encreasing. I have not yet entered into terms
   with him; this is only the Second Number, the first I was not Concerned
   in. I beg your acceptance of one of the enclosed, and request you to
   present the other to my good Friend, Mr. Scott, to whom I Intend to
   address a Letter when I can have time and opportunity to entertain him
   with a few amusing Particulars.

   I have not Time Sir to copy this Letter fair, as I have a long one to
   write to my Father wherefore I beg you to accept it as it is, and should
   he request you to take Charge or forward a Letter to me, from him, I
   entreat your kindness thereon.

   Please to present my Duty to Mr. Scott as early as you conveniently can. 
   
   I am Hon Sir your much obliged Humble Servt.

   P. S.

   Should be greatly obliged to you for any thing you may judge serviceable
   to the magazine, when you make your much hoped for return to America, or
   sooner if you please. Should be obliged to you to purchase me Goldsmith's
   History of the Earth and Animated Nature, when you return. In short Sir,
   We should be glad you would think of us before you embark and beg leave to
   trouble you with an unlimited commission.
