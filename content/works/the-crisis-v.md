   Crisis V

    

   Foner's introduction:

   The fifth Crisis was dated at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, March 21, 1778, and
   was written at a very critical period of the war. Internal dissensions
   among the officers of the Continental Army threatened to split apart the
   armed forces of the nation. And the sharp contrast between the luxurious
   life of the Tories who remained with Howe in Philadelphia after he had
   possessed the city on September 26, 1777, and the wretched conditions
   facing the soldiers with Washington at Valley Forge was demoralizing the
   entire country.

   The first part of this Crisis, addressed "to General Sir William Howe"
   reminded the wrangling patriots who the common enemy was; the second,
   addressed "to the inhabitants of America" pointed to the great
   opportunities facing the nation if the people acted promptly and
   decisively. "The only way to finish a war," cried Paine, "with the least
   possible bloodshed, or perhaps without any, is to collect an army against
   the power of which the enemy shall have no chance." This note of courage
   did much to lift the sagging morale of soldiers and civilians alike.

   TO GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE

   TO argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason, and
   whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like
   administering medicine to the dead, or endeavoring to convert an atheist
   by scripture. Enjoy, sir, your insensibility of feeling and reflecting. It
   is the prerogative of animals. And no man will envy you these honors, in
   which a savage only can be your rival and a bear your master.

   As the generosity of this country rewarded your brother's services in the
   last war, with an elegant monument in Westminster Abbey, it is consistent
   that she should bestow some mark of distinction upon you. You certainly
   deserve her notice, and a conspicuous place in the catalogue of
   extraordinary persons. Yet it would be a pity to pass you from the world
   in state, and consign you to magnificent oblivion among the tombs, without
   telling the future beholder why. Judas is as much known as John, yet
   history ascribes their fame to very different actions.

   Sir William has undoubtedly merited a monument; but of what kind, or with
   what inscription, where placed or how embellished, is a question that
   would puzzle all the heralds of St. James's in the profoundest mood of
   historical deliberation. We are at no loss, sir, to ascertain your real
   character, but somewhat perplexed how to perpetuate its identity, and
   preserve it uninjured from the transformations of time or mistake. A
   statuary may give a false expression to your bust, or decorate it with
   some equivocal emblems, by which you may happen to steal into reputation
   and impose upon the hereafter traditionary world. Ill nature or ridicule
   may conspire, or a variety of accidents combine to lessen, enlarge, or
   change Sir William's fame; and no doubt but he who has taken so much pains
   to be singular in his conduct, would choose to be just as singular in his
   exit, his monument and his epitaph.

   The usual honors of the dead, to be sure, are not sufficiently sublime to
   escort a character like you to the republic of dust and ashes; for however
   men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or of government here, the grave
   is nevertheless a perfect republic. Death is not the monarch of the dead,
   but of the dying. The moment he obtains a conquest he loses a subject,
   and, like the foolish king you serve, will, in the end, war himself out of
   all his dominions.

   As a proper preliminary towards the arrangement of your funeral honors, we
   readily admit of your new rank of knighthood. The title is perfectly in
   character, and is your own, more by merit than creation. There are knights
   of various orders, from the knight of the windmill to the knight of the
   post. The former is your patron for exploits, and the latter will assist
   you in settling your accounts. No honorary title could be more happily
   applied! The ingenuity is sublime! And your royal master has discovered
   more genius in fitting you therewith, than in generating the most finished
   figure for a button, or descanting on the properties of a button mould.

   But how, sir, shall we dispose of you? The invention of a statuary is
   exhausted, and Sir William is yet unprovided with a monument. America is
   anxious to bestow her funeral favors upon you, and wishes to do it in a
   manner that shall distinguish you from all the deceased heroes of the last
   war. The Egyptian method of embalming is not known to the present age, and
   hieroglyphical pageantry hath outlived the science of deciphering it. Some
   other method, therefore, must be thought of to immortalize the new knight
   of the windmill and post. Sir William, thanks to his stars, is not
   oppressed with very delicate ideas. He has no ambition of being wrapped up
   and handed about in myrrh, aloes and cassia. Less expensive odors will
   suffice; and it fortunately happens that the simple genius of America has
   discovered the art of preserving bodies, and embellishing them too, with
   much greater frugality than the ancients. In balmage, sir, of humble tar,
   you will be as secure as Pharaoh, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers, rival
   in finery all the mummies of Egypt.

   As you have already made your exit from the moral world, and by numberless
   acts both of passionate and deliberate injustice engraved an "here lieth"
   on your deceased honor, it must be mere affectation in you to pretend
   concern at the humors or opinions of mankind respecting you. What remains
   of you may expire at any time. The sooner the better. For he who survives
   his reputation, lives out of despite of himself, like a man listening to
   his own reproach.

   Thus entombed and ornamented, I leave you to the inspection of the
   curious, and return to the history of your yet surviving actions. The
   character of Sir William has undergone some extraordinary revolutions
   since his arrival in America. It is now fixed and known; and we have
   nothing to hope from your candor or to fear from your capacity. Indolence
   and inability have too large a share in your composition, ever to suffer
   you to be anything more than the hero of little villainies and unfinished
   adventures. That, which to some persons appeared moderation in you at
   first, was not produced by any real virtue of your own, but by a contrast
   of passions, dividing and holding you in perpetual irresolution. One vice
   will frequently expel another, without the least merit in the man; as
   powers in contrary directions reduce each other to rest.

   It became you to have supported a dignified solemnity of character; to
   have shown a superior liberality of soul; to have won respect by an
   obstinate perseverance in maintaining order, and to have exhibited on all
   occasions such an unchangeable graciousness of conduct, that while we
   beheld in you the resolution of an enemy, we might admire in you the
   sincerity of a man. You came to America under the high sounding titles of
   commander and commissioner; not only to suppress what you call rebellion,
   by arms, but to shame it out of countenance by the excellence of your
   example. Instead of which, you have been the patron of low and vulgar
   frauds, the encourager of Indian cruelties; and have imported a cargo of
   vices blacker than those which you pretend to suppress.

   Mankind are not universally agreed in their determination of right and
   wrong; but there are certain actions which the consent of all nations and
   individuals has branded with the unchangeable name of meanness. In the
   list of human vices we find some of such a refined constitution, they
   cannot be carried into practice without seducing some virtue to their
   assistance; but meanness has neither alliance nor apology. It is generated
   in the dust and sweepings of other vices, and is of such a hateful figure
   that all the rest conspire to disown it. Sir William, the commissioner of
   George the Third, has at last vouchsafed to give it rank and pedigree. He
   has placed the fugitive at the council board, and dubbed it companion of
   the order of knighthood.

   The particular act of meanness which I allude to in this description, is
   forgery. You, sir, have abetted and patronized the forging and uttering
   counterfeit continental bills. In the same New York newspapers in which
   your own proclamation under your master's authority was published,
   offering, or pretending to offer, pardon and protection to these states,
   there were repeated advertisements of counterfeit money for sale, and
   persons who have come officially from you, and under the sanction of your
   flag, have been taken up in attempting to put them off.

   A conduct so basely mean in a public character is without precedent or
   pretence. Every nation on earth, whether friends or enemies, will unite in
   despising you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon society, which nothing can
   excuse or palliate,- an improvement upon beggarly villany- and shows an
   inbred wretchedness of heart made up between the venomous malignity of a
   serpent and the spiteful imbecility of an inferior reptile.

   The laws of any civilized country would condemn you to the gibbet without
   regard to your rank or titles, because it is an action foreign to the
   usage and custom of war; and should you fall into our hands, which pray
   God you may, it will be a doubtful matter whether we are to consider you
   as a military prisoner or a prisoner for felony.

   Besides, it is exceedingly unwise and impolitic in you, or any other
   persons in the English service, to promote or even encourage, or wink at
   the crime of forgery, in any case whatever. Because, as the riches of
   England, as a nation, are chiefly in paper, and the far greater part of
   trade among individuals is carried on by the same medium, that is, by
   notes and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all people in the
   world, ought to endeavor to keep forgery out of sight, and, if possible,
   not to revive the idea of it. It is dangerous to make men familiar with a
   crime which they may afterwards practise to much greater advantage against
   those who first taught them. Several officers in the English army have
   made their exit at the gallows for forgery on their agents; for we all
   know, who know any thing of England, that there is not a more necessitous
   body of men, taking them generally, than what the English officers are.
   They contrive to make a show at the expense of the tailors, and appear
   clean at the charge of the washer-women.

   England, has at this time, nearly two hundred million pounds sterling of
   public money in paper, for which she has no real property: besides a large
   circulation of bank notes, bank post bills, and promissory notes and
   drafts of private bankers, merchants and tradesmen. She has the greatest
   quantity of paper currency and the least quantity of gold and silver of
   any nation in Europe; the real specie, which is about sixteen millions
   sterling, serves only as change in large sums, which are always made in
   paper, or for payment in small ones. Thus circumstanced, the nation is put
   to its wit's end, and obliged to be severe almost to criminality, to
   prevent the practice and growth of forgery. Scarcely a session passes at
   the Old Bailey, or an execution at Tyburn, but witnesses this truth, yet
   you, sir, regardless of the policy which her necessity obliges her to
   adopt, have made your whole army intimate with the crime. And as all
   armies at the conclusion of a war, are too apt to carry into practice the
   vices of the campaign, it will probably happen, that England will
   hereafter abound in forgeries, to which art the practitioners were first
   initiated under your authority in America. You, sir, have the honor of
   adding a new vice to the military catalogue; and the reason, perhaps, why
   the invention was reserved for you, is, because no general before was mean
   enough even to think of it.

   That a man whose soul is absorbed in the low traffic of vulgar vice, is
   incapable of moving in any superior region, is clearly shown in you by the
   event of every campaign. Your military exploits have been without plan,
   object or decision. Can it be possible that you or your employers suppose
   that the possession of Philadelphia will be any ways equal to the expense
   or expectation of the nation which supports you? What advantages does
   England derive from any achievements of yours? To her it is perfectly
   indifferent what place you are in, so long as the business of conquest is
   unperformed and the charge of maintaining you remains the same.

   If the principal events of the three campaigns be attended to, the balance
   will appear against you at the close of each; but the last, in point of
   importance to us, has exceeded the former two. It is pleasant to look back
   on dangers past, and equally as pleasant to meditate on present ones when
   the way out begins to appear. That period is now arrived, and the long
   doubtful winter of war is changing to the sweeter prospects of victory and
   joy. At the close of the campaign, in 1775, you were obliged to retreat
   from Boston. In the summer of 1776, you appeared with a numerous fleet and
   army in the harbor of New York. By what miracle the continent was
   preserved in that season of danger is a subject of admiration! If instead
   of wasting your time against Long Island you had run up the North River,
   and landed any where above New York, the consequence must have been, that
   either you would have compelled General Washington to fight you with very
   unequal numbers, or he must have suddenly evacuated the city with the loss
   of nearly all the stores of his army, or have surrendered for want of
   provisions; the situation of the place naturally producing one or the
   other of these events.

   The preparations made to defend New York were, nevertheless, wise and
   military; because your forces were then at sea, their numbers uncertain;
   storms, sickness, or a variety of accidents might have disabled their
   coming, or so diminished them on their passage, that those which survived
   would have been incapable of opening the campaign with any prospect of
   success; in which case the defence would have been sufficient and the
   place preserved; for cities that have been raised from nothing with an
   infinitude of labor and expense, are not to be thrown away on the bare
   probability of their being taken. On these grounds the preparations made
   to maintain New York were as judicious as the retreat afterwards. While
   you, in the interim, let slip the very opportunity which seemed to put
   conquest in your power.

   Through the whole of that campaign you had nearly double the forces which
   General Washington immediately commanded. The principal plan at that time,
   on our part, was to wear away the season with as little loss as possible,
   and to raise the army for the next year. Long Island, New York, Forts
   Washington and Lee were not defended after your superior force was known
   under any expectation of their being finally maintained, but as a range of
   outworks, in the attacking of which your time might be wasted, your
   numbers reduced, and your vanity amused by possessing them on our retreat.
   It was intended to have withdrawn the garrison from Fort Washington after
   it had answered the former of those purposes, but the fate of that day put
   a prize into your hands without much honor to yourselves.

   Your progress through the Jerseys was accidental; you had it not even in
   contemplation, or you would not have sent a principal part of your forces
   to Rhode Island beforehand. The utmost hope of America in the year 1776,
   reached no higher than that she might not then be conquered. She had no
   expectation of defeating you in that campaign. Even the most cowardly Tory
   allowed, that, could she withstand the shock of that summer, her
   independence would be past a doubt. You had then greatly the advantage of
   her. You were formidable. Your military knowledge was supposed to be
   complete. Your fleets and forces arrived without an accident. You had
   neither experience nor reinforcements to wait for. You had nothing to do
   but to begin, and your chance lay in the first vigorous onset.

   America was young and unskilled. She was obliged to trust her defence to
   time and practice; and has, by mere dint of perseverance, maintained her
   cause, and brought the enemy to a condition, in which she is now capable
   of meeting him on any grounds.

   It is remarkable that in the campaign of 1776 you gained no more,
   notwithstanding your great force, than what was given you by consent of
   evacuation, except Fort Washington; while every advantage obtained by us
   was by fair and hard fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was
   complete. The conquest of the Hessians at Trenton, by the remains of a
   retreating army, which but a few days before you affected to despise, is
   an instance of their heroic perseverance very seldom to be met with. And
   the victory over the British troops at Princeton, by a harassed and
   wearied party, who had been engaged the day before and marched all night
   without refreshment, is attended with such a scene of circumstances and
   superiority of generalship, as will ever give it a place in the first rank
   in the history of great actions.

   When I look back on the gloomy days of last winter, and see America
   suspended by a thread, I feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of her
   delivery, and a reverence for the characters which snatched her from
   destruction. To doubt now would be a species of infidelity, and to forget
   the instruments which saved us then would be ingratitude.

   The close of that campaign left us with the spirit of conquerors. The
   northern districts were relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over
   the lakes. The army under your command were hunted back and had their
   bounds prescribed. The continent began to feel its military importance,
   and the winter passed pleasantly away in preparations for the next
   campaign.

   However confident you might be on your first arrival, the result of the
   year 1776 gave you some idea of the difficulty, if not impossibility of
   conquest. To this reason I ascribe your delay in opening the campaign of
   1777. The face of matters, on the close of the former year, gave you no
   encouragement to pursue a discretionary war as soon as the spring admitted
   the taking the field; for though conquest, in that case, would have given
   you a double portion of fame, yet the experiment was too hazardous. The
   ministry, had you failed, would have shifted the whole blame upon you,
   charged you with having acted without orders, and condemned at once both
   your plan and execution.

   To avoid the misfortunes, which might have involved you and your money
   accounts in perplexity and suspicion, you prudently waited the arrival of
   a plan of operations from England, which was that you should proceed for
   Philadelphia by way of the Chesapeake, and that Burgoyne, after reducing
   Ticonderoga, should take his route by Albany, and, if necessary, join you.

   The splendid laurels of the last campaign have flourished in the north. In
   that quarter America has surprised the world, and laid the foundation of
   this year's glory. The conquest of Ticonderoga, (if it may be called a
   conquest) has, like all your other victories, led on to ruin. Even the
   provisions taken in that fortress (which by General Burgoyne's return was
   sufficient in bread and flour for nearly 5000 men for ten weeks, and in
   beef and pork for the same number of men for one month) served only to
   hasten his overthrow, by enabling him to proceed to Saratoga, the place of
   his destruction. A short review of the operations of the last campaign
   will show the condition of affairs on both sides.

   You have taken Ticonderoga and marched into Philadelphia. These are all
   the events which the year has produced on your part. A trifling campaign
   indeed, compared with the expenses of England and the conquest of the
   continent. On the other side, a considerable part of your northern force
   has been routed by the New York militia under General Herkemer. Fort
   Stanwix has bravely survived a compound attack of soldiers and savages,
   and the besiegers have fled. The Battle of Bennington has put a thousand
   prisoners into our hands, with all their arms, stores, artillery and
   baggage. General Burgoyne, in two engagements, has been defeated; himself,
   his army, and all that were his and theirs are now ours. Ticonderoga and
   Independence [forts] are retaken, and not the shadow of an enemy remains
   in all the northern districts. At this instant we have upwards of eleven
   thousand prisoners, between sixty and seventy [captured] pieces of brass
   ordnance, besides small arms, tents, stores, etc.

   In order to know the real value of those advantages, we must reverse the
   scene, and suppose General Gates and the force he commanded to be at your
   mercy as prisoners, and General Burgoyne, with his army of soldiers and
   savages, to be already joined to you in Pennsylvania. So dismal a picture
   can scarcely be looked at. It has all the tracings and colorings of horror
   and despair; and excites the most swelling emotions of gratitude by
   exhibiting the miseries we are so graciously preserved from.

   I admire the distribution of laurels around the continent. It is the
   earnest of future union. South Carolina has had her day of sufferings and
   of fame; and the other southern States have exerted themselves in
   proportion to the force that invaded or insulted them. Towards the close
   of the campaign, in 1776, these middle States were called upon and did
   their duty nobly. They were witnesses to the almost expiring flame of
   human freedom. It was the close struggle of life and death, the line of
   invisible division; and on which the unabated fortitude of a Washington
   prevailed, and saved the spark that has since blazed in the north with
   unrivalled lustre.

   Let me ask, sir, what great exploits have you performed? Through all the
   variety of changes and opportunities which the war has produced, I know no
   one action of yours that can be styled masterly. You have moved in and
   out, backward and forward, round and round, as if valor consisted in a
   military jig. The history and figure of your movements would be truly
   ridiculous could they be justly delineated. They resemble the labors of a
   puppy pursuing his tail; the end is still at the same distance, and all
   the turnings round must be done over again.

   The first appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga wore such an unpromising
   aspect, that it was necessary, in July, to detach a part of the forces to
   the support of that quarter, which were otherwise destined or intended to
   act against you; and this, perhaps, has been the means of postponing your
   downfall to another campaign. The destruction of one army at a time is
   work enough. We know, sir, what we are about, what we have to do, and how
   to do it.

   Your progress from the Chesapeake, was marked by no capital stroke of
   policy or heroism. Your principal aim was to get General Washington
   between the Delaware and Schuylkill, and between Philadelphia and your
   army. In that situation, with a river on each of his flanks, which united
   about five miles below the city, and your army above him, you could have
   intercepted his reinforcements and supplies, cut off all his communication
   with the country, and, if necessary, have despatched assistance to open a
   passage for General Burgoyne. This scheme was too visible to succeed: for
   had General Washington suffered you to command the open country above him,
   I think it a very reasonable conjecture that the conquest of Burgoyne
   would not have taken place, because you could, in that case, have relieved
   him. It was therefore necessary, while that important victory was in
   suspense, to trepan you into a situation in which you could only be on the
   defensive, without the power of affording him assistance. The manoeuvre
   had its effect, and Burgoyne was conquered.

   There has been something unmilitary and passive in you from the time of
   your passing the Schuylkill and getting possession of Philadelphia, to the
   close of the campaign. You mistook a trap for a conquest, the probability
   of which had been made known to Europe, and the edge of your triumph taken
   off by our own information long before.

   Having got you into this situation, a scheme for a general attack upon you
   at Germantown was carried into execution on the 4th of October, and though
   the success was not equal to the excellence of the plan, yet the
   attempting it proved the genius of America to be on the rise, and her
   power approaching to superiority. The obscurity of the morning was your
   best friend, for a fog is always favorable to a hunted enemy. Some weeks
   after this you likewise planned an attack on General Washington while at
   Whitemarsh. You marched out with infinite parade, but on finding him
   preparing to attack you next morning, you prudently turned about, and
   retreated to Philadelphia with all the precipitation of a man conquered in
   imagination.

   Immediately after the battle of Germantown, the probability of Burgoyne's
   defeat gave a new policy to affairs in Pennsylvania, and it was judged
   most consistent with the general safety of America, to wait the issue of
   the northern campaign. Slow and sure is sound work. The news of that
   victory arrived in our camp on the 18th of October, and no sooner did that
   shout of joy, and the report of the thirteen cannon reach your ears, than
   you resolved upon a retreat, and the next day, that is, on the 19th, you
   withdrew your drooping army into Philadelphia. This movement was evidently
   dictated by fear; and carried with it a positive confession that you
   dreaded a second attack. It was hiding yourself among women and children,
   and sleeping away the choicest part of the campaign in expensive
   inactivity. An army in a city can never be a conquering army. The
   situation admits only of defence. It is mere shelter: and every military
   power in Europe will conclude you to be eventually defeated.

   The time when you made this retreat was the very time you ought to have
   fought a battle, in order to put yourself in condition of recovering in
   Pennsylvania what you had lost in Saratoga. And the reason why you did
   not, must be either prudence or cowardice; the former supposes your
   inability, and the latter needs no explanation. I draw no conclusions,
   sir, but such as are naturally deduced from known and visible facts, and
   such as will always have a being while the facts which produced them
   remain unaltered.

   After this retreat a new difficulty arose which exhibited the power of
   Britain in a very contemptible light; which was the attack and defence of
   Mud Island. For several weeks did that little unfinished fortress stand
   out against all the attempts of Admiral and General Howe. It was the fable
   of Bender realized on the Delaware. Scheme after scheme, and force upon
   force were tried and defeated. The garrison, with scarce anything to cover
   them but their bravery, survived in the midst of mud, shot and shells, and
   were at last obliged to give it up more to the powers of time and
   gunpowder than to military superiority of the besiegers.

   It is my sincere opinion that matters are in much worse condition with you
   than what is generally known. Your master's speech at the opening of
   Parliament, is like a soliloquy on ill luck. It shows him to be coming a
   little to his reason, for sense of pain is the first symptom of recovery,
   in profound stupefaction. His condition is deplorable. He is obliged to
   submit to all the insults of France and Spain, without daring to know or
   resent them; and thankful for the most trivial evasions to the most humble
   remonstrances. The time was when he could not deign an answer to a
   petition from America, and the time now is when he dare not give an answer
   to an affront from France. The capture of Burgoyne's army will sink his
   consequence as much in Europe as in America. In his speech he expresses
   his suspicions at the warlike preparations of France and Spain, and as he
   has only the one army which you command to support his character in the
   world with, it remains very uncertain when, or in what quarter it will be
   most wanted, or can be best employed; and this will partly account for the
   great care you take to keep it from action and attacks, for should
   Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it probably will, England may take her
   endless farewell not only of all America but of all the West Indies.

   Never did a nation invite destruction upon itself with the eagerness and
   the ignorance with which Britain has done. Bent upon the ruin of a young
   and unoffending country, she has drawn the sword that has wounded herself
   to the heart, and in the agony of her resentment has applied a poison for
   a cure. Her conduct towards America is a compound of rage and lunacy; she
   aims at the government of it, yet preserves neither dignity nor character
   in her methods to obtain it. Were government a mere manufacture or article
   of commerce, immaterial by whom it should be made or sold, we might as
   well employ her as another, but when we consider it as the fountain from
   whence the general manners and morality of a country take their rise, that
   the persons entrusted with the execution thereof are by their serious
   example an authority to support these principles, how abominably absurd is
   the idea of being hereafter governed by a set of men who have been guilty
   of forgery, perjury, treachery, theft and every species of villany which
   the lowest wretches on earth could practise or invent. What greater public
   curse can befall any country than to be under such authority, and what
   greater blessing than to be delivered therefrom. The soul of any man of
   sentiment would rise in brave rebellion against them, and spurn them from
   the earth.

   The malignant and venomous tempered General Vaughan has amused his savage
   fancy in burning the whole town of Kingston, in York government, and the
   late governor of that state, Mr. Tryon, in his letter to General Parsons,
   has endeavored to justify it and declared his wish to burn the houses of
   every committeeman in the country. Such a confession from one who was once
   intrusted with the powers of civil government, is a reproach to the
   character. But it is the wish and the declaration of a man whom anguish
   and disappointment have driven to despair, and who is daily decaying into
   the grave with constitutional rottenness.

   There is not in the compass of language a sufficiency of words to express
   the baseness of your king, his ministry and his army. They have refined
   upon villany till it wants a name. To the fiercer vices of former ages
   they have added the dregs and scummings of the most finished rascality,
   and are so completely sunk in serpentine deceit, that there is not left
   among them one generous enemy.

   From such men and such masters, may the gracious hand of Heaven preserve
   America! And though the sufferings she now endures are heavy, and severe,
   they are like straws in the wind compared to the weight of evils she would
   feel under the government of your king, and his pensioned Parliament.

   There is something in meanness which excites a species of resentment that
   never subsides, and something in cruelty which stirs up the heart to the
   highest agony of human hatred; Britain has filled up both these characters
   till no addition can be made, and has not reputation left with us to
   obtain credit for the slightest promise. The will of God has parted us,
   and the deed is registered for eternity. When she shall be a spot scarcely
   visible among the nations, America shall flourish the favorite of heaven,
   and the friend of mankind.

   For the domestic happiness of Britain and the peace of the world, I wish
   she had not a foot of land but what is circumscribed within her own
   island. Extent of dominion has been her ruin, and instead of civilizing
   others has brutalized herself. Her late reduction of India, under Clive
   and his successors, was not so properly a conquest as an extermination of
   mankind. She is the only power who could practise the prodigal barbarity
   of tying men to mouths of loaded cannon and blowing them away. It happens
   that General Burgoyne, who made the report of that horrid transaction, in
   the House of Commons, is now a prisoner with us, and though an enemy, I
   can appeal to him for the truth of it, being confident that he neither can
   nor will deny it. Yet Clive received the approbation of the last
   Parliament.

   When we take a survey of mankind, we cannot help cursing the wretch, who,
   to the unavoidable misfortunes of nature, shall wilfully add the
   calamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the world
   without studying to increase them, and that life is sufficiently short
   without shaking the sand that measures it. The histories of Alexander, and
   Charles of Sweden, are the histories of human devils; a good man cannot
   think of their actions without abhorrence, nor of their deaths without
   rejoicing. To see the bounties of heaven destroyed, the beautiful face of
   nature laid waste, and the choicest works of creation and art tumbled into
   ruin, would fetch a curse from the soul of piety itself. But in this
   country the aggravation is heightened by a new combination of affecting
   circumstances. America was young, and, compared with other countries, was
   virtuous. None but a Herod of uncommon malice would have made war upon
   infancy and innocence: and none but a people of the most finished
   fortitude, dared under those circumstances, have resisted the tyranny. The
   natives, or their ancestors, had fled from the former oppressions of
   England, and with the industry of bees had changed a wilderness into a
   habitable world. To Britain they were indebted for nothing. The country
   was the gift of heaven, and God alone is their Lord and Sovereign.

   The time, sir, will come when you, in a melancholy hour, shall reckon up
   your miseries by your murders in America. Life, with you, begins to wear a
   clouded aspect. The vision of pleasurable delusion is wearing away, and
   changing to the barren wild of age and sorrow. The poor reflection of
   having served your king will yield you no consolation in your parting
   moments. He will crumble to the same undistinguished ashes with yourself,
   and have sins enough of his own to answer for. It is not the farcical
   benedictions of a bishop, nor the cringing hypocrisy of a court of
   chaplains, nor the formality of an act of Parliament, that can change
   guilt into innocence, or make the punishment one pang the less. You may,
   perhaps, be unwilling to be serious, but this destruction of the goods of
   Providence, this havoc of the human race, and this sowing the world with
   mischief, must be accounted for to him who made and governs it. To us they
   are only present sufferings, but to him they are deep rebellions.

   If there is a sin superior to every other, it is that of wilful and
   offensive war. Most other sins are circumscribed within narrow limits,
   that is, the power of one man cannot give them a very general extension,
   and many kinds of sins have only a mental existence from which no
   infection arises; but he who is the author of a war, lets loose the whole
   contagion of hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death. We
   leave it to England and Indians to boast of these honors; we feel no
   thirst for such savage glory; a nobler flame, a purer spirit animates
   America. She has taken up the sword of virtuous defence; she has bravely
   put herself between Tyranny and Freedom, between a curse and a blessing,
   determined to expel the one and protect the other.

   It is the object only of war that makes it honorable. And if there was
   ever a just war since the world began, it is this in which America is now
   engaged. She invaded no land of yours. She hired no mercenaries to burn
   your towns, nor Indians to massacre their inhabitants. She wanted nothing
   from you, and was indebted for nothing to you: and thus circumstanced, her
   defence is honorable and her prosperity is certain.

   Yet it is not on the justice only, but likewise on the importance of this
   cause that I ground my seeming enthusiastical confidence of our success.
   The vast extension of America makes her of too much value in the scale of
   Providence, to be cast like a pearl before swine, at the feet of an
   European island; and of much less consequence would it be that Britain
   were sunk in the sea than that America should miscarry. There has been
   such a chain of extraordinary events in the discovery of this country at
   first, in the peopling and planting it afterwards, in the rearing and
   nursing it to its present state, and in the protection of it through the
   present war, that no man can doubt, but Providence has some nobler end to
   accomplish than the gratification of the petty elector of Hanover, or the
   ignorant and insignificant king of Britain.

   As the blood of the martyrs has been the seed of the Christian church, so
   the political persecutions of England will and have already enriched
   America with industry, experience, union, and importance. Before the
   present era she was a mere chaos of uncemented colonies, individually
   exposed to the ravages of the Indians and the invasion of any power that
   Britain should be at war with. She had nothing that she could call her
   own. Her felicity depended upon accident. The convulsions of Europe might
   have thrown her from one conqueror to another, till she had been the slave
   of all, and ruined by every one; for until she had spirit enough to become
   her own master, there was no knowing to which master she should belong.
   That period, thank God, is past, and she is no longer the dependent,
   disunited colonies of Britain, but the independent and United States of
   America, knowing no master but heaven and herself. You, or your king, may
   call this "delusion," "rebellion," or what name you please. To us it is
   perfectly indifferent. The issue will determine the character, and time
   will give it a name as lasting as his own.

   You have now, sir, tried the fate of three campaigns, and can fully
   declare to England, that nothing is to be got on your part, but blows and
   broken bones, and nothing on hers but waste of trade and credit, and an
   increase of poverty and taxes. You are now only where you might have been
   two years ago, without the loss of a single ship, and yet not a step more
   forward towards the conquest of the continent; because, as I have already
   hinted, "an army in a city can never be a conquering army." The full
   amount of your losses, since the beginning of the war, exceeds twenty
   thousand men, besides millions of treasure, for which you have nothing in
   exchange. Our expenses, though great, are circulated within ourselves.
   Yours is a direct sinking of money, and that from both ends at once;
   first, in hiring troops out of the nation, and in paying them afterwards,
   because the money in neither case can return to Britain. We are already in
   possession of the prize, you only in pursuit of it. To us it is a real
   treasure, to you it would be only an empty triumph. Our expenses will
   repay themselves with tenfold interest, while yours entail upon you
   everlasting poverty.

   Take a review, sir, of the ground which you have gone over, and let it
   teach you policy, if it cannot honesty. You stand but on a very tottering
   foundation. A change of the ministry in England may probably bring your
   measures into question, and your head to the block. Clive, with all his
   successes, had some difficulty in escaping, and yours being all a war of
   losses, will afford you less pretensions, and your enemies more grounds
   for impeachment.

   Go home, sir, and endeavor to save the remains of your ruined country, by
   a just representation of the madness of her measures. A few moments, well
   applied, may yet preserve her from political destruction. I am not one of
   those who wish to see Europe in a flame, because I am persuaded that such
   an event will not shorten the war. The rupture, at present, is confined
   between the two powers of America and England. England finds that she
   cannot conquer America, and America has no wish to conquer England. You
   are fighting for what you can never obtain, and we defending what we never
   mean to part with. A few words, therefore, settle the bargain. Let England
   mind her own business and we will mind ours. Govern yourselves, and we
   will govern ourselves. You may then trade where you please unmolested by
   us, and we will trade where we please unmolested by you; and such articles
   as we can purchase of each other better than elsewhere may be mutually
   done. If it were possible that you could carry on the war for twenty years
   you must still come to this point at last, or worse, and the sooner you
   think of it the better it will be for you.

   My official situation enables me to know the repeated insults which
   Britain is obliged to put up with from foreign powers, and the wretched
   shifts that she is driven to, to gloss them over. Her reduced strength and
   exhausted coffers in a three years' war with America, has given a powerful
   superiority to France and Spain. She is not now a match for them. But if
   neither councils can prevail on her to think, nor sufferings awaken her to
   reason, she must e'en go on, till the honor of England becomes a proverb
   of contempt, and Europe dub her the Land of Fools.

   I am, Sir, with every wish for an honorable peace,

   Your friend, enemy, and countryman,

   COMMON SENSE.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   To THE INHABITANTS OF AMERICA

   With all the pleasure with which a man exchanges bad company for good, I
   take my leave of Sir William and return to you. It is now nearly three
   years since the tyrrany of Britain received its first repulse by the arms
   of America. A period which has given birth to a new world, and erected a
   monument to the folly of the old.

   I cannot help being sometimes surprised at the complimentary references
   which I have seen and heard made to ancient histories and transactions.
   The wisdom, civil governments, and sense of honor of the states of Greece
   and Rome, are frequently held up as objects of excellence and imitation.
   Mankind have lived to very little purpose, if, at this period of the
   world, they must go two or three thousand years back for lessons and
   examples. We do great injustice to ourserves by placing them in such a
   superior line. We have no just authority for it, neither can we tell why
   it is that we should suppose ourselves inferior.

   Could the mist of antiquity be cleared away, and men and things be viewed
   as they really were, it is more than probable that they would admire us,
   rather than we them. America has surmounted a greater variety and
   combination of difficulties, than, I believe, ever fell to the share of
   any one people, in the same space of time, and has replenished the world
   with more useful knowledge and sounder maxims of civil government than
   were ever produced in any age before. Had it not been for America, there
   had been no such thing as freedom left throughout the whole universe.
   England has lost hers in a long chain of right reasoning from wrong
   principles, and it is from this country, now, that she must learn the
   resolution to redress herself, and the wisdom how to accomplish it.

   The Grecians and Romans were strongly possessed of the spirit of liberty
   but not the principle, for at the time that they were determined not to be
   slaves themselves, they employed their power to enslave the rest of
   mankind. But this distinguished era is blotted by no one misanthropical
   vice. In short, if the principle on which the cause is founded, the
   universal blessings that are to arise from it, the difficulties that
   accompanied it, the wisdom with which it has been debated, the fortitude
   by which it has been supported, the strength of the power which we had to
   oppose, and the condition in which we undertook it, be all taken in one
   view, we may justly style it the most virtuous and illustrious revolution
   that ever graced the history of mankind.

   A good opinion of ourselves is exceedingly necessary in private life, but
   absolutely necessary in public life, and of the utmost importance in
   supporting national character. I have no notion of yielding the palm of
   the United States to any Grecians or Romans that were ever born. We have
   equalled the bravest in times of danger, and excelled the wisest in
   construction of civil governments.

   From this agreeable eminence let us take a review of present affairs. The
   spirit of corruption is so inseparably interwoven with British politics,
   that their ministry suppose all mankind are governed by the same motives.
   They have no idea of a people submitting even to temporary inconvenience
   from an attachment to rights and privileges. Their plans of business are
   calculated by the hour and for the hour, and are uniform in nothing but
   the corruption which gives them birth. They never had, neither have they
   at this time, any regular plan for the conquest of America by arms. They
   know not how to go about it, neither have they power to effect it if they
   did know. The thing is not within the compass of human practicability, for
   America is too extensive either to be fully conquered or passively
   defended. But she may be actively defended by defeating or making
   prisoners of the army that invades her. And this is the only system of
   defence that can be effectual in a large country.

   There is something in a war carried on by invasion which makes it differ
   in circumstances from any other mode of war, because he who conducts it
   cannot tell whether the ground he gains be for him, or against him, when
   he first obtains it. In the winter of 1776, General Howe marched with an
   air of victory through the Jerseys, the consequence of which was his
   defeat; and General Burgoyne at Saratoga experienced the same fate from
   the same cause. The Spaniards, about two years ago, were defeated by the
   Algerines in the same manner, that is, their first triumphs became a trap
   in which they were totally routed. And whoever will attend to the
   circumstances and events of a war carried on by invasion, will find, that
   any invader, in order to be finally conquered must first begin to conquer.

   I confess myself one of those who believe the loss of Philadelphia to be
   attended with more advantages than injuries. The case stood thus: The
   enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more importance to us than it really
   was; for we all know that it had long ceased to be a port: not a cargo of
   goods had been brought into it for near a twelvemonth, nor any fixed
   manufactories, nor even ship-building, carried on in it; yet as the enemy
   believed the conquest of it to be practicable, and to that belief added
   the absurd idea that the soul of all America was centred there, and would
   be conquered there, it naturally follows that their possession of it, by
   not answering the end proposed, must break up the plans they had so
   foolishly gone upon, and either oblige them to form a new one, for which
   their present strength is not sufficient, or to give over the attempt.

   We never had so small an army to fight against, nor so fair an opportunity
   of final success as now. The death wound is already given. The day is ours
   if we follow it up. The enemy, by his situation, is within our reach, and
   by his reduced strength is within our power. The ministers of Britain may
   rage as they please, but our part is to conquer their armies. Let them
   wrangle and welcome, but let it not draw our attention from the one thing
   needful. Here, in this spot is our own business to be accomplished, our
   felicity secured. What we have now to do is as clear as light, and the way
   to do it is as straight as a line. It needs not to be commented upon, yet,
   in order to be perfectly understood I will put a case that cannot admit of
   a mistake.

   Had the armies under Generals Howe and Burgoyne been united, and taken
   post at Germantown, and had the northern army under General Gates been
   joined to that under General Washington, at Whitemarsh, the consequence
   would have been a general action; and if in that action we had killed and
   taken the same number of officers and men, that is, between nine and ten
   thousand, with the same quantity of artillery, arms, stores, etc. as have
   been taken at the northward, and obliged General Howe with the remains of
   his army, that is, with the same number he now commands, to take shelter
   in Philadelphia, we should certainly have thought ourselves the greatest
   heroes in the world; and should, as soon as the season permitted, have
   collected together all the force of the continent and laid siege to the
   city, for it requires a much greater force to besiege an enemy in a town
   than to defeat him in the field. The case now is just the same as if it
   had been produced by the means I have here supposed. Between nine and ten
   thousand have been killed and taken, all their stores are in our
   possession, and General Howe, in consequence of that victory, has thrown
   himself for shelter into Philadelphia. He, or his trifling friend
   Galloway,8 may form what pretences they please, yet no just reason can be
   given for their going into winter quarters so early as the 19th of
   October, but their apprehensions of a defeat if they continued out, or
   their conscious inability of keeping the field with safety. I see no
   advantage which can arise to America by hunting the enemy from state to
   state. It is a triumph without a prize, and wholly unworthy the attention
   of a people determined to conquer. Neither can any state promise itself
   security while the enemy remains in a condition to transport themselves
   from one part of the continent to another. Howe, likewise, cannot conquer
   where we have no army to oppose, therefore any such removals in him are
   mean and cowardly, and reduces Britain to a common pilferer. If he
   retreats from Philadelphia, he will be despised; if he stays, he may be
   shut up and starved out, and the country, if he advances into it, may
   become his Saratoga. He has his choice of evils and we of opportunities.
   If he moves early, it is not only a sign but a proof that he expects no
   reinforcement, and his delay will prove that he either waits for the
   arrival of a plan to go upon, or force to execute it, or both; in which
   case our strength will increase more than his, therefore in any case we
   cannot be wrong if we do but proceed.

   The particular condition of Pennsylvania deserves the attention of all the
   other States. Her military strength must not be estimated by the number of
   inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, characters, professions and
   interests. Here are the firmest Whigs, surviving, like sparks in the
   ocean, unquenched and uncooled in the midst of discouragement and
   disaffection. Here are men losing their all with cheerfulness, and
   collecting fire and fortitude from the flames of their own estates. Here
   are others skulking in secret, many making a market of the times, and
   numbers who are changing to Whig or Tory with the circumstances of every
   day.

   It is by a mere dint of fortitude and perseverance that the Whigs of this
   State have been able to maintain so good a countenance, and do even what
   they have done. We want help, and the sooner it can arrive the more
   effectual it will be. The invaded State, be it which it may, will always
   feel an additional burden upon its back, and be hard set to support its
   civil power with sufficient authority; and this difficulty will rise or
   fall, in proportion as the other states throw in their assistance to the
   common cause.

   The enemy will most probably make many manoeuvres at the opening of this
   campaign, to amuse and draw off the attention of the several States from
   the one thing needful. We may expect to hear of alarms and pretended
   expeditions to this place and that place, to the southward, the eastward,
   and the northward, all intended to prevent our forming into one formidable
   body. The less the enemy's strength is, the more subtleties of this kind
   will they make use of. Their existence depends upon it, because the force
   of America, when collected, is sufficient to swallow their present army
   up. It is therefore our business to make short work of it, by bending our
   whole attention to this one principal point, for the instant that the main
   body under General Howe is defeated, al the inferior alarms throughout the
   continent, like so many shadows, will follow his downfall.

   The only way to finish a war with the least possible bloodshed, or perhaps
   without any, is to collect an army, against the power of which the enemy
   shall have no chance. By not doing this, we prolong the war, and double
   both the calamities and expenses of it. What a rich and happy country
   would America be, were she, by a vigorous exertion, to reduce Howe as she
   has reduced Burgoyne. Her currency would rise to millions beyond its
   present value. Every man would be rich, and every man would have it in his
   power to be happy. And why not do these things? What is there to hinder?
   America is her own mistress and can do what she pleases.

   If we had not at this time a man in the field, we could, nevertheless,
   raise an army in a few weeks sufficient to overwhelm all the force which
   General Howe at present commands. Vigor and determination will do anything
   and everything. We began the war with this kind of spirit, why not end it
   with the same ? Here, gentlemen, is the enemy. Here is the army. The
   interest, the happiness of all America, is centred in this half ruined
   spot. Come and help us. Here are laurels, come and share them. Here are
   Tories, come and help us to expel them. Here are Whigs that will make you
   welcome, and enemies that dread your coming.

   The worst of all policies is that of doing things by halves. Penny-wise
   and pound-foolish, has been the ruin of thousands. The present spring, if
   rightly improved, will free us from our troubles, and save us the expense
   of millions. We have now only one army to cope with. No opportunity can be
   fairer; no prospect more promising. I shall conclude this paper with a few
   outlines of a plan, either for filling up the battalions with expedition,
   or for raising an additional force, for any limited time, on any sudden
   emergency.

   That in which every man is interested, is every man's duty to support. And
   any burden which falls equally on all men, and from which every man is to
   receive an equal benefit, is consistent with the most perfect ideas of
   liberty. I would wish to revive something of that virtuous ambition which
   first called America into the field. Then every man was eager to do his
   part, and perhaps the principal reason why we have in any degree fallen
   therefrom, is because we did not set a right value by it at first, but
   left it to blaze out of itself, instead of regulating and preserving it by
   just proportions of rest and service.

   Suppose any State whose number of effective inhabitants was 8o,ooo, should
   be required to furnish 3,200 men towards the defence of the continent on
   any sudden emergency.

   1st, Let the whole number of effective inhabitants be divided into
   hundreds; then if each of those hundreds turn out four men, the whole
   number of 3,200 will be had.

   2d, Let the name of each hundred men be entered in a book, and let four
   dollars be collected from each man, with as much more as any of the
   gentlemen, whose abilities can afford it, shall please to throw in, which
   gifts likewise shall be entered against the names of the donors.

   3d, Let the sums so collected be offered as a present, over and above the
   bounty of twenty dollars, to any four who may be inclined to propose
   themselves as volunteers: if more than four offer, the majority of the
   subscribers present shall determine which; if none offer, then four out

   of the hundred shall be taken by lot, who shall be entitled to the said
   sums, and shall either go, or provide others that will, in the space of
   six days.

   4th, As it will always happen that in the space of ground on which a
   hundred men shall live, there will be always a number of persons who, by
   age and infirmity, are incapable of doing personal service, and as such
   persons are generally possessed of the greatest part of property in any
   country, their portion of service, therefore, will be to furnish each man
   with a blanket, which will make a regimental coat, jacket, and breeches,
   or clothes in lieu thereof, and another for a watch cloak, and two pair of
   shoes; for however choice people may be of these things matters not in
   cases of this kind; those who live always in houses can find many ways to
   keep themselves warm, but it is a shame and a sin to suffer a soldier in
   the field to want a blanket while there is one in the country.

   Should the clothing not be wanted, the superannuated or infirm persons
   possessing property, may, in lieu thereof, throw in their money
   subscriptions towards increasing the bounty; for though age will naturally
   exempt a person from personal service, it cannot exempt him from his share
   of the charge, because the men are raised for the defence of property and
   liberty jointly.

   There never was a scheme against which objections might not be raised. But
   this alone is not a sufficient reason for rejection. The only line to
   judge truly upon is to draw out and admit all the objections which can
   fairly be made, and place against them all the contrary qualities,
   conveniences and advantages, then by striking a balance you come at the
   true character of any scheme, principle or position.

   The most material advantages of the plan here proposed are, ease,
   expedition, and cheapness; yet the men so raised get a much larger bounty
   than is any where at present given; because all the expenses,
   extravagance, and consequent idleness of recruiting are saved or
   prevented. The country incurs no new debt nor interest thereon; the whole
   matter being all settled at once and entirely done with. It is a
   subscription answering all the purposes of a tax, without either the
   charge or trouble of collecting. The men are ready for the field with the
   greatest possible expedition, because it becomes the duty of the
   inhabitants themselves, in every part of the country, to find their
   proportion of men instead of leaving it to a recruiting sergeant, who, be
   he ever so industrious, cannot know always where to apply.

   I do not propose this as a regular digested plan, neither will the limits
   of this paper admit of any further remarks upon it. I believe it to be a
   hint capable of much improvement, and as such submit it to the public.

   COMMON SENSE.

   LANCASTER,March 21, 1778.
