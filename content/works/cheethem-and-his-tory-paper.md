Title: Cheethem and his Tory Paper

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This brief essay represents one of Paine's last efforts to cement cordial
   relationship between America and France. Cheetham's paper was, of course,
   the American Citizen, once a Jeffersonian organ, but by the time the
   article was written, September 25, 1807, a scandal-sheet with reactionary
   leanings.

   ***

   CHEETHAM is frequently giving symptoms of being the successor of Cullen,
   alias Carpenter, as Cullen was the successor of Cobbett, alias Porcupine.
   Like him, he is seeking to involve the United States in a quarrel with
   France for the benefit of England.

   In his paper of Tuesday, September 22, he has a long abusive piece against
   France, under the title of "Remarks" on the speech of the arch-chancellor
   of France to the French Senate. This is a matter that CHEETHAM, as an
   adopted American citizen, has no business with; and as a John BULL it is
   impertinence in him to come here to spit out his venom against France. But
   CHEETHAM cannot live without quarreling, nor write without abuse. He is a
   disgrace to the republicans, whose principle is to live in peace and
   friendship with all nations, and not to interfere in the domestic concerns
   of any.

   CHEETHAM seems to regret that peace is made on the continent of Europe,
   and he shows his spleen against it by the following round-about scurrilous
   paragraph.

   "The people of France," says he, "now breathe the air of peace, under
   slavery, closer, more systematic, military, and universal (CHEETHAM knows
   nothing about it), than that with which they were overwhelmed previous to
   the beginning of the long continued calamity." This is spoken exactly in
   the character of a stupid prejudiced John BULL, who, shut up in his
   island, and ignorant of the world, supposed all nations slaves but
   themselves; whereas, those at a distance can see, that of all people
   enslaved by their governments, none are so much so as the people of
   England. Had CHEETHAM stayed in England till this time, he would have had
   to shoulder a musket, and this would have been dreadful to him, for, as
   all bullies are cowards, the smell of gunpowder would be as horrid to
   CHEETHAM, as the scent of a skunk to other animals.

   The danger to which the city of New York was exposed, by the continual
   abuse of France in such papers as CULLEN's, was, that the French
   government might be induced to consider the city of New York as a British
   colony, such as it was during the revolutionary war, and exclude her from
   the commerce of the continent of Europe, as she has excluded Britain.
   CHEETHAM is following the footsteps of CULLEN.

   The French nation, under all its changes of government, has always behaved
   in a civil and friendly manner to the United States. We have no cause of
   dispute with France. It was by the aid of France in men, money, and ships,
   that the revolution and independence of the United States were so
   completely established1, and it is scarcely sufferable that a prejudiced
   and surly-tempered John BULL should fix himself among us to abuse a
   friendly power.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   September 25, 1807.

   1. Six thousand French troops under General Rochambeau and thirty-one sail
   of the line under Admiral De Grass, assisted at the capture of Cornwallis
   at Yorktown, Virginia.
