   CHEETHAM AND HIS TORY PAPER.
   
   from the *Public Advertiser* (New York), September 26, 1807.

   CHEETHAM is frequently giving symptoms of being the successor of *Cullen*,
   alias *Carpenter*, as Cullen was the successor of *Cobbett*, alias *Porcupine*.
   Like him he is seeking to involve the United States in a quarrel with
   France for the benefit of England.

   In his paper of Tuesday, Sept. 22, he has a long abusive piece against
   France, under the title of "*Remarks*" on the speech of the Arch Chancellor
   of France to the French Senate. This is a matter that Cheetham, as an
   adopted American Citizen, has no business with; and as a John Bull it is
   impertinence in him to come here to spew out his venom against France. But
   Cheetham cannot live without quarreling, nor write without abuse. He is a
   disgrace to the Republicans, whose principle is, to live in peace and
   friendship with all nations and not to interfere in the domestic concerns
   of any.

   Cheetham seems to regret that peace is made on the continent of Europe,
   and he shews his spleen against it by the following round-about scurrilous
   paragraph:

   "The people of France, says he, now breathe the air of peace under
   slavery closer, more systematic, military, and universal, (Cheetham knows
   nothing about it) than that with which they were overwhelmed previous to
   the beginning of the long continued calamity." &mdash; This is spoken exactly in
   the character of a stupid prejudiced John Bull, who, shut up in his
   island and ignorant of the world supposes all nations slaves but
   themselves; whereas those at a distance can see that of all people
   enslaved by their governments, none are so much so as the people of
   England. Had Cheetham staid in England till this time he would have had
   to shoulder a musket and this would have been dreadful to him, for as
   all bullies are cowards, the smell of gunpowder would be as horrid to
   Cheetham as the scent of a skunk to other animals.

   The danger to which the city of New York was exposed, by the continual
   abuse of France in such papers as Cullen's, was, that the French
   government might be induced to consider the city of New York as a British
   Colony, such as it was during the revolutionary war, and exclude her from
   the commerce of the continent of Europe, as she has excluded Britain.
   Cheetham is following the footsteps of Cullen.

   The French nation, under all its changes of government has always behaved
   in a civil and friendly manner to the United States. We have no cause of
   dispute with France. It was by the aid of France in men, money, and ships,
   that the revolution and independence of the United States were so
   completely established(1), and it is scarcely sufferable that a prejudiced
   and surly tempered John Bull should fix himself among us to abuse a
   friendly power.

   September 25, 1807.

   1. Six thousand French troops under General Rochambeau, and thirty-one sail
   of the line under Admiral De Grass, assisted at the capture of Cornwallis
   at Yorktown, Virginia, which put an end to the war.
