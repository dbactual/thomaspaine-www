   To Richard Henry Lee  July 1, 1777

   PHILADELPHIA,

   MY DEAR SIR:

   Soon after your absence from this city we began to have a little military
   news stirring. On the 11th inst. Governor Mifflin by direction from
   General Washington, acquainted the inhabitants at a meeting in the State
   House yard that from the late preparations of the enemy, their intentions
   were for this city. His address was received with as much spirit as it was
   delivered, and the meeting unanimously resolved to turn out agreeable to
   the Militia Law on the 13th. At night Generals Howe and Cornwallis moved
   to Somerset 8 miles from Brunswick and on the 19th at night retreated
   again to Brunswick. On the morning of the 22d they evacuated the last
   mentioned place and retreated to Amboy.

   I am at a loss to account for General Howe's movements on any other than
   the following-his short march from Brunswick to Somerset afforded him an
   opportunity of trying the disposition of the states of New Jersey and
   Pennsylvania as to the turning out of the Militia, which was very
   necessary for him to be acquainted with before he ventured too far into
   the country-it was like moving the previous question, and the issue was
   against him, for the Militia of both states took the alarm instantly-it
   then became necessary for him to make a retreat to Amboy and a feint if
   necessary over to Staten Island, in order that the Militia, which his
   first march has raised, might be dismissed, and the 3000 men from General
   Putnam countermanded-both these events have happened and last Thursday
   General Howe left Amboy and made his appearance again in the country. He
   is I believe too weak to hope for a decisive victory and is trying to win
   it as a game, besides which, as this is their only army, they are obliged
   to preserve it as an army of observation on the motions of the French and
   Spaniards in the West Indies.

   I sincerely regret your absence, both on account of your private
   friendship and your public service; and I have the pleasure if I may call
   it such for I wish the occasion had not happened of hearing many others in
   the same opinion. A man that sets out upon a public bottom must always
   expect to be privately undermined in some quarter or other. I have often
   remarked that those who are benefited by the public service of another
   without feeling themselves rivaled will always be the friends of merit,
   but those who are benefited by being rivaled, will from envy, ever be its
   enemies-and thus by tracing a received affront to its true cause and
   reflecting philosophically thereon, a person may often draw very agreeable
   consolation therefrom.

   We have had nothing stirring of news for three weeks past. When the enemy
   marched from Amboy they endeavored to surprise the division under Lord
   Sterling. We lost two if not three pieces of artillery. No other material
   loss.

   I am Dear Sir, your affectionate humble servant,

   T. PAINE.
