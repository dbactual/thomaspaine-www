   Archbishop Tillotson says: "The difference between the style of the Old
   and New Testament is so remarkable, that one of the greatest sects in the
   primitive times, did, upon this very ground, found their heresy of two
   Gods, the one evil, fierce and cruel, whom they called the God of the Old
   Testament; the other good, kind and merciful, whom they called the God of
   the New Testament; so great a difference is there between the
   representations that are given of God in the books of the Jewish and
   Christian religion, as to give, at least, some color and pretense to an
   imagination of two Gods." Thus far Tillotson.

   But the case was that as the Church had picked out several passages from
   the Old Testament, which she most absurdly and falsely calls prophecies of
   Jesus Christ (whereas there is no prophecy of any such person, as anyone
   may see by examining the passages and the cases to which they apply), she
   was under the necessity of keeping up the credit of the Old Testament,
   because if that fell the other would soon follow, and the Christian system
   of faith would soon be at an end.

   As a book of morals, there are several parts of the New Testament that are
   good; but they are no other than what had been preached in the Eastern
   world several hundred years before Christ was born. Confucius, the Chinese
   philosopher, who lived five hundred years before the time of Christ, says,
   Acknowledge thy benefits by the return of benefits, but never revenge
   injuries.

   The clergy in Popish countries were cunning enough to know that if the Old
   Testament was made public, the fallacy of the New, with respect to Christ,
   would be detected, and they prohibited the use of it, and always took it
   away wherever they found it.

   The Deists, on the contrary, always encouraged the reading it, that people
   might see and judge for themselves, that a book so full of contradictions
   and wickedness could not be the Word of God, and that we dishonor God by
   ascribing it to Him.

   A TRUE DEIST.
