Title: The Affair of Silas Deane

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   So much was written during the controversy over the conduct of Silas Deane
   that most historians hesitate to delve into what has been termed "a mess."
   The main facts, however, are fairly simple. The chief issue centered on
   the question whether the supplies secretly furnished to the United States
   by France prior to the Franco-American alliance of 1778 through Caron de
   Beaumarchais, commissary agent for the king and chiefly remembered as
   author of "The Barber of Seville" and "The Marriage of Figaro," were to be
   a charge against the United States or were a gift from the French
   government. Silas Deane, American commissioner to France, had been
   connected with many of the transactions with Beaumarchais, and he stoutly
   maintained that they were of a distinctly commercial nature. Arthur Lee,
   another commissioner, opposed this view and suggested that Deane and
   Beaumarchais had concocted the story to line their own pockets. Paine, as
   Secretary of the Committee of Foreign Affairs in the Continental Congress,
   had come upon much information which convinced him that Lee's story was
   correct, and that Deane was simply trying to extort money from Congress to
   which he was not entitled. With the aim in mind of saving Congress money
   falsely claimed by Deane, he published information he had been officially
   trusted to keep secret. As the controversy increased in intensity, Paine
   revealed more and more information, but by so doing he also revealed
   information about France's relations with America, prior to the signing of
   the Treaty of Alliance, which was exceedingly embarrassing to good
   relations between the two allies. Hence Paine was made the scape-goat, and
   was compelled to resign his post as Secretary, January 9, 1779.

   As the controversy continued it began to take on other aspects, for it
   merged with the struggle within Pennsylvania between the popular forces
   and the conservatives. The former championed Lee while the latter
   supported Deane. Articles-usually printed over pseudonyms-appeared daily
   in the press as Paine, Arthur Lee, Richard Henry Lee, William Lee, and
   Timothy Matlock, spokesmen for the popular forces, fought a verbal battle
   with Deane, Robert Morris, Matthew Clarkson, Robert Treat Paine, William
   Duer, and Gouverneur Morris, leaders of the conservative forces. Basic
   issues connected with the conduct of a people's war were raised and
   discussed in these daily articles. Paine considered it intolerable that
   Robert Morris, active in Congressional affairs, should be associated with
   Deane in commercial as well as governmental transactions, and condemned
   such conduct as a great menace to victory. Speculators and monopolizers,
   he charged, were helping to break down the people's morale, and he
   suggested that the State Assemblies should investigate such activities by
   all former and present delegates to Congress. Pennsylvania should lead the
   way, he wrote. During the course of this controversy Paine was active on a
   popular committee to investigate and stamp out monopolistic practices,
   which were causing prices to rise exorbitantly. One of the first persons
   investigated by the committee was Robert Morris himself.

     It is clear, therefore, that the Deane affair has considerable
   importance in relation to the internal struggle that was waging during the
   Revolutionary War between radicals and conservatives. But very few of
   Paine's articles on this aspect of the Deane affair have ever been
   included in any collection of his writings before. 

   To Silas Deane, Esq. [From Pennsylvania Packet, December 15, 1778.]

   AFTER reading a few lines of your address to the public in the
   Pennsylvania Packet of December 6th,[actually it was Dec. 5th - editor] I
   can truly say, that concern got the better of curiosity, and I felt an
   unwillingness to go through it. Mr. Deane must very well know that I have
   no interest in, so likewise am I no stranger to, his negotiations and
   contracts in France, his difference with his colleagues, the reason of his
   return to America, and the matters which have occurred since. All these
   are to me familiar things; and while I can but be surprised at the conduct
   of Mr. Deane, I lament the unnecessary torture he has imprudently
   occasioned. That disagreements will arise between individuals, even to the
   perplexity of a State, is nothing new, but that they should be
   outrageously brought forward, by one whose station abroad should have
   taught him a delicacy of manners and even an excess of prudence, is
   something strange. The mind of a living public is quickly alarmed and
   easily tormented. It not only suffers by the stroke, but is frequently
   fretted by the cure, and ought therefore to be tenderly dealt with, and
   never ought to be trifled with. It feels first and reasons afterwards. Its
   jealousy keeps vibrating between the accused and the accuser, and on a
   failure of proof always fixes on the latter. Had Mr. Deane's address
   produced no uneasiness in the body he appeals to, it would have been a
   sign, not of tranquility, but death: and though it is painful to see it
   unnecessarily tortured, it is pleasant to contemplate the living cause.
   Mr. Deane is particularly circumstanced. He has advantages which seldom
   happen, and when they do happen, ought to be used with the nicest care and
   strictest honor. He has the opportunity of telling his own tale and there
   is none to reply to him. Two of the gentlemen he so freely censures are
   three thousand miles off, and the other two he so freely affronts are
   Members of Congress; one of them likewise, Col. R. H. Lee, is absent in
   Virginia; and however painful may be their feelings, they must attend the
   progressive conduct of the house. No Member in Congress can individually
   take up the matter without becoming inconsistent, and none of the public
   understands it sufficiently. With these advantages Mr. Deane ought to be
   nicely and strictly the gentleman, in his language, his assertions, his
   insinuations and his facts. He presents himself, as his own evidence, upon
   his honor, and any misrepresentation or disingenuous trifling in him will
   be fatal.

   Mr. Deane begins his address with a general display of his services in
   France, and strong insinuations against the Hon. Arthur and William Lee,
   he brings his complaints down to the time of signing the treaty, and from
   thence to the fourth of March, when he received the following order of
   Congress which he inserts at large:

   "In Congress, December 8, 1777. Whereas it is of the greatest importance
   that Congress should at this critical juncture be well informed of the
   state of affairs in Europe. And whereas Congress have resolved that the
   Honorable Silas Deane, Esq., be recalled from the Court of France, and
   have appointed another Commissioner to supply his place there. Ordered,
   that the committee for foreign correspondence, write to the Honorable
   Silas Deane, and direct him to embrace the first opportunity of returning
   to America, and upon his arrival to repair with all possible dispatch to
   Congress." Mr. Deane then says "and having placed my papers and yours in
   safety, I left Paris the 30th to embark for my native country, on board
   that fleet which your great and generous ally sent out for your
   assistance, in full confidence that I should not be detained on the
   business I was sent for."

    I am obliged to tell Mr. Deane that this arrangement is somewhat
   uncandid, for on the reading it, it creates an opinion and likewise
   carries an appearance that Mr. Deane was only sent for, as the necessary
   and proper person from whom Congress might obtain a history of their
   affairs, and learn the character of their foreign agents, commissioners
   and ambassadors, after which Mr. Deane was to return. Is Mr. Deane so
   little master of address as not to know that censure may be politely
   conveyed by an apology? For however Mr. Deane may choose to represent or
   misrepresent the matter, the truth is that his contracts and engagements
   in France, had so involved and embarrassed Congress, that they found it
   necessary and resolved to recall him, that is ordered him home, to give an
   account of his own conduct, and likewise to save him from a train of
   disagreeable consequences, which must have arisen to him had he continued
   in France. I would not be supposed to insinuate, that he might be thought
   unsafe, but unfit.

   There is a certain and necessary association of dignity between the person
   and the employment which perhaps did not appear when Mr. Deane was
   considered the ambassador. His address to the public confirms the justness
   of this remark. The spirit and language of it differ exceedingly from that
   cool penetrating judgment and refinement of manners and expression which
   fits, and is absolutely necessary in, the plenipotentiary. His censures
   are coarse and vehement, and when he speaks of himself, he begs, nay
   almost weeps to be believed. It was the intricacy of Mr. Deane's own
   official affairs, his multiplied contracts in France before the arrival of
   Dr. Franklin or any of the other Commissioners; his assuming authorities,
   and entering into engagements, in the time of his commercial agency, for
   which he had neither commission nor instruction, and the general unsettled
   state of his accounts, that were among the reasons that produced the
   motion for recalling and superseding him. Why then does Mr. Deane endeavor
   to lead the attention of the public to a wrong object, and bury the real
   reasons under a tumult of new and perhaps unnecessary suspicions?

   Mr. Deane in the beginning of his address to the public says, "What I
   write to you, I would have said to your representatives, their ears have
   been shut against me, by an attention to matters, which my respect for
   them induces me to believe were of 'more importance.' "

   In this paragraph Mr. Deane's excuse becomes his accuser, and his
   justification in his offence; for if the greater importance of other
   matters is supposed and given by himself as a reason, why he was not
   heard, it is likewise a sufficient reason, why he ought not to have
   complained that "their ears were shut'' and a good reason why he ought to
   have waited a more convenient time. But besides the inconsistency of this
   charge, there is something in it that will suffer by an inquiry, and I am
   sorry that Mr. Deane's imprudence has obliged me to mention a circumstance
   which affects his honor as a gentleman, his reputation as a man. In order
   to be clearly understood on this head, I am obliged to go back with Mr.
   Deane to the time of his quitting France on account of his being recalled.

   "I left Paris," says Mr. Deane, "on the 30th of March, 1778 to embark for
   my native country, having placed 'my papers and yours in safety.'" Would
   anybody have supposed that a gentleman in the character of a commercial
   agent, and afterwards in that of a public minister, would return home
   after seeing himself both recalled and superseded, and not bring with him
   his papers and vouchers? And why he has done so must appear to every one
   exceedingly unaccountable. After Mr. Deane's arrival he had two audiences
   with Congress in August last, in neither of which did he offer the least
   charge against the gentleman he has so loudly upbraided in his address to
   the public: neither has he yet accounted for his expenditure of public
   money, which, as it might have been done by a written state of accounts,
   might for that reason have been done at any time, and was a part of the
   business which required an audience.

   There is something curiously intricate and evasive in Mr. Deane's saying
   in his address, that he left France "in full confidence that he should not
   be detained on the business he was sent for." And the only end it can
   answer to him is to furnish out a present excuse for not producing his
   papers. Mr. Deane had no right, either from the literal or implied sense
   of the resolution itself, to suppose that he should return to France in
   his former public character, or that he was "sent for," as he styles it,
   on any other personal business than that which related to himself. Mr.
   Deane must be sensible, if he will but candidly reflect, that as an agent
   only, he greatly exceeded his line and embarrassed the Congress, the
   continent, the army and himself.

   Mr. Deane's address to the public is dated "Nov."-but without any day of
   the month; and here a new scene of ungenteel evasion opens. On the last
   day of that month, viz. the 30th, he addressed a letter to Congress
   signifying his intentions of returning to France, and pressing to have his
   affairs brought to some conclusion, which, I presume, on account of the
   absence of his papers could not well be done; therefore Mr. Deane's
   address to the public must be written before the 30th, and consequently
   before his letter to Congress, which carries an appearance of its being
   only a feint in order to make a confused diversion in his favor at the
   time his affairs should come under consideration.

   What favors this opinion, is that on the next day, that is December 1st,
   and partly in consequence of Mr. Deane's letter to them of the 30th, the
   Congress entered the following resolution.

   "In Congress December 1st, 1778.-Resolved, That after tomorrow Congress
   will meet two hours at least each evening, beginning at six o'clock,
   Saturday evening excepted, until the present state of their foreign
   affairs be fully considered."

   As an inquiry into the state of foreign affairs naturally and effectually
   included all and every part of Mr. Deane's, he was thereupon regularly
   notified by letter to attend; and on the fourth he wrote again to
   Congress, acquainting them with his having received that notification and
   expressed his thanks; yet on the day following, viz. the fifth he
   published his extraordinary address in the newspapers, which, on account
   of its unsupported matter, the fury of its language and temper, and its
   inconsistency with other parts of his conduct, is incompatible with that
   character (which on account of the station he had been honored with, and
   the sense that should have impressed him in consequence thereof) he ought
   to have maintained.

   On the appearance of Mr. Deane's address of the fifth, the public became
   jealously uneasy, and well they might. They were unacquainted with the
   train of circumstances that preceded and attended it, and were naturally
   led to suppose, that Mr. Deane, on account of the station he had filled,
   must be too much a gentleman to deceive them. It was Mr. Deane's
   particular fortune to grow into consequence from accident. Sent to France
   as a commercial agent under the appointment of a committee, he rose as a
   matter of convenience to the station of a Commissioner of Congress; and
   with what dignity he might fill out that character, the public will judge
   from his conduct since; and perhaps be led to substitute convenience as an
   excuse for the appointment.

   A delicacy of difficulties likewise arose in Congress on the appearance of
   the said address; for setting aside the matter, the irregular manner of
   it, as a proceeding, was a breach of decency; and as Mr. Deane after being
   notified to attend an inquiry into foreign affairs, had circumstantially
   withdrawn from that mode, by appealing to the public, and at the same time
   said "their ears were shut against him," it was therefore given as a
   reason by some, that to take any notice of Mr. Deane in the interim would
   look like suppressing his public information, if he had any to give; and
   consequently would imply dishonor on the House,-and that as he had
   transferred his case to the public, before it had been rejected by the
   Congress, he ought therefore to be left with the public, till he had done
   with them and they with him; and that whether his information was true or
   not, it was an insult on the people, because it was making them the ladder
   on which he insulted their representatives by an unjust complaint of
   neglect. Others who might anticipate the anxiety of the public, and
   apprehend discontents would arise from a supposed inattention, were for
   adopting measures to prevent them, and of consequence inclined to a
   different line of conduct, and this division of sentiment on what might be
   supposed the honor of the House, occasioned the then President, Henry
   Laurens, Esq., who adhered to the former opinion, to resign the chair. The
   majority on the sentiments was a single vote. In this place I take the
   liberty of remarking, for the benefit of succeeding generations, that the
   Honorable President before mentioned, having filled that station for one
   year in October last, made his resignation of the presidency at the
   expiration of the year, lest any example taken from his continuance might
   have become inconvenient. I have an additional satisfaction in mentioning
   this useful historical anecdote, because it is done wholly unknown to the
   gentleman to whom it relates, or to any other gentleman in or out of
   Congress. He was replaced by a unanimous vote. But to return to my
   narration-

   In the Pennsylvania Packet of December 8th, Francis Lightfoot Lee, Esq.,
   brother to the gentleman so rudely treated in Mr. Deane's publication, and
   the only one now present, put in a short address to the public, requesting
   a suspension of their judgment till the matter could be fully investigated
   by those whose immediate business it became: meaning Congress. And Mr.
   Deane in the paper of the 10th published another note, in which he
   informs, "that the Honorable Congress did, on Saturday morning the 5th
   instant, assign Monday evening to hear him." But why does Mr. Deane
   conceal the resolution of Congress of December 1st, in consequence of
   which he was notified to attend regularly an inquiry into the state of
   foreign affairs? By so doing, he endeavors to lead the public into a
   belief that his being heard on Monday was extorted purely in consequence
   of his address of the 5th, and that otherwise he should not have been
   heard at all. I presume Congress, are anxious to hear him, and to have his
   accounts arranged and settled; and if this should be the case, why did Mr.
   Deane leave his papers in France, and now complain that his affairs are
   not concluded? In the same note Mr. Deane likewise says, "that Congress
   did on that evening, Monday, resolve, that Mr. Deane do report in writing,
   as soon as may be, his agency of their affairs in Europe, together, with
   any intelligence respecting their foreign affairs which he may judge
   proper." But why does Mr. Deane omit giving the remaining part of the
   resolution, which says, "That Mr. Deane be informed, that if he has
   anything to communicate to Congress in the interim of immediate
   importance, that he should be heard tomorrow evening." I can see no
   propriety, in omitting this part, unless Mr. Deane concluded that by
   publishing it he might put a quick expiration to his credit by his not
   being able to give the wondrous information he had threatened in his
   address. In the conclusion of this note, Mr. Deane likewise says, "I
   therefore conceive that I cannot, with propriety, continue my narrative at
   present. In the mean time I submit it to the good sense of the public,
   whether I ought to take any notice of a publication signed Francis
   Lightfoot Lee, opposed to stubborn and undeniable facts."

   Thus far I have compared Mr. Deane with himself, and whether he has been
   candid or uncandid, consistent or inconsistent, I leave to judgment of
   those who read it. Mr. Deane cannot have the least right to think that I
   am moved by any party difference or personal antipathy. He is a gentleman
   with whom I never had a syllable of dispute, nor with any other person
   upon his account. Who are his friends, his connections, or his foes, is
   wholly indifferent to me, and what I have written will be a secret to
   everybody till it comes from the press. The convulsion which the public
   were thrown into by his address will, I hope, justify my taking up a
   matter in which I should otherwise have been perfectly silent; and
   whatever may be its fate my intention is a good one; besides which there
   was no other person who knew the affair sufficiently, or knowing it, could
   confidently do it, and yet it was necessary to be done.

   I shall now take a short review of what Mr. Deane calls "stubborn and
   undeniable facts." Mr. Deane must be exceedingly unconversant both with
   terms and ideas, not to distinguish even between a wandering probability
   and a fact; and between a forced inclination and a proof; for admitting
   every circumstance of information in Mr. Deane's address to be true, they
   are still but circumstances, and his deductions from them are hypothetical
   and inconclusive.

   Mr. Deane has involved a gentleman in his unlimited censure, whose
   fidelity and personal qualities I have been well acquainted with for three
   years past; and in respect to an absent injured friend, Colonel Richard
   Henry Lee, I will venture to tell Mr. Deane, that in any style of
   character in which a gentleman may be spoken of, Mr. Deane would suffer by
   a comparison. He has one defect which perhaps Mr. Deane is acquainted
   with, the misfortune of having but one hand.

   The charges likewise which he advances against the Honorable Arthur and
   William Lee are, to me, circumstantial evidences of Mr. Deane's unfitness
   for a public character; for it is the business of a foreign minister to
   learn other men's secrets and keep their own. Mr. Deane has given a short
   history of Mr. Arthur Lee and Dr. Berkenhout1 in France, and he has
   brought the last mentioned person again on the stage in America. There is
   something in this so exceedingly weak, that I am surprised that anyone who
   would be thought a man of sense, should risk his reputation upon such a
   frivolous tale; for the event of the story, if any can be produced from
   it, is greatly against himself.

   He says that a correspondence took place in France between Dr. Berkenhout
   and Mr. [Arthur] Lee; that Mr. Lee showed part of the correspondence to
   Dr. Franklin and himself; and that in order to give the greater weight to
   Dr. Berkenhout's remarks he gave them to understand, that Dr. Berkenhout
   was in the secrets of the British Ministry. What Mr. Deane has related
   this for, or what he means to infer from it, I cannot understand; for the
   political inference ought to be, that if Mr. Lee really thought that Dr.
   Berkenhout was in the secrets of the British Ministry, he was therefore
   the very person with whom Mr. Lee ought, as an ambassador, to cultivate a
   correspondence, and introduce to his colleagues, in order to discover what
   those secrets were, that they might be transmitted to America; and if Mr.
   Deane acted otherwise, he unwisely mistook his own character. However,
   this I can assure Mr. Deane, upon my own knowledge, that more and better
   information has come from Mr. Lee than ever came from himself; and how or
   where he got it, is not a subject fit for public inquiry: unless Mr. Deane
   means to put a stop to all future informations. I can likewise tell Mr.
   Deane, that Mr. Lee was particularly commissioned by a certain body, and
   that under every sacred promise of inviolable secrecy, to make discoveries
   in England, and transmit them. Surely Mr. Deane must have left his
   discretion with his papers, or he would see the imprudence of his present
   conduct.

   In the course of Mr. Deane's narrative he mentions Dr. Berkenhout again.
   "In September last," says he, "I was informed that Dr. Berkenhout, who I
   have before mentioned, was in jail in this city. I confess I was
   surprised, considering what I have already related, that this man should
   have the audacity to appear in the capital of America." But why did not
   Mr. Deane confront Dr. Berkenhout while he was here? Why did he not give
   information to Congress or to the Council before whom he was examined, and
   by whom he was discharged and sent back for want of evidence against him?
   Mr. Deane was the only person that knew anything of him, and it looks very
   unfavorable in him that he was silent when he should have spoke, if he had
   anything to say, and now he has gone has a great deal to tell, and that
   about nothing. "I immediately," says Mr. Deane, "set myself about the
   measures which I conceived necessary to investigate his plans and
   designs." This is indeed a trifling excuse, for it wanted no great deal of
   setting about, the whole secret as well as the means being with himself,
   and half an hour's in- formation might have been sufficient. What Mr.
   Deane means by "investigating his plans and designs," I cannot understand,
   unless he intended to have the Doctor's nativity cast by a conjurer. Yet
   this trifling roundabout story is one of Mr. Deane's "stubborn and
   undeniable facts." However it is thus far a fact, that Mr. Deane kept it a
   secret till the man was gone.

   He likewise entertains us with a history of what passed at New York
   between Dr. Berkenhout and Governor Johnstone; but as he must naturally
   think that his readers must wonder how he came by such knowledge, he
   prudently supplies the defect by saying "that Providence in whom we put
   our trust, 'unfolded it to me "-revealed it, I suppose. As to what Dr.
   Berkenhout was, or what he came for, is a matter of very little
   consequence to us. He appeared to be a man of good moral character, of a
   studious turn of mind, and genteel behavior, and whether he had
   whimsically employed himself, or was employed on a foolish errand by
   others, is a business not worth our enquiring after; he got nothing here,
   and to send him back was both necessary and civil. He introduced himself
   to General Maxwell at Elizabethtown, as knowing Mr. Arthur Lee; the
   General wrote a letter of information to Colonel R. H. Lee who presented
   the same to Congress. But it does not appear that Mr. Deane moved in the
   matter till a considerable time after the Doctor was sent off, and then
   Mr. Deane put a series of queries in the newspaper to know why he was let
   go. I little thought at that time that the queries were Mr. Deane's, as
   they really appeared to me to be the produce of some little mind.

   Mr. Deane likewise tells us that Mr. A. Lee was suspected by some of our
   best friends because of his acquaintance with Lord Shelburne; and perhaps
   some Mr. Deane in England might find out that Lord Shelburne ought to be
   suspected because of his acquaintance with Mr. Lee. Mr. Deane appears to
   me neither to understand characters nor business, or he would not mention
   Lord Shelburne on such an occasion whose uniform and determined opposition
   to the Ministry appears to be known to everybody but Mr. Deane. Mr. Deane
   has given us a quotation from a letter [of Arthur Lee's] which he never
   saw, and had it likewise from a gentleman in France who had never seen it,
   but who had heard it from a correspondent in England to whom it was not
   sent; and this traditionary story is another of Mr. Deane's stubborn and
   undeniable facts. But even supposing the quotation to be true, the only
   inference from it is naturally this, "That the sooner England makes peace
   with America the better it will be for her." Had the intimation been given
   before the treaty with France was signed, it might have been justly
   censured, but being given after, it can have but one meaning, and that a
   clear one. He likewise says, that Charles Fox "declared pointedly in the
   House of Commons," that the treaty between France and America was signed,
   and as Charles Fox knows Lord Shelburne, and Lord Shelburne Mr. Lee,
   therefore Mr. Deane infers, "as a stubborn and undeniable fact," that Mr.
   Lee must tell it. Does Mr. Deane know that nothing can be long a secret in
   a Court, especially where the countries are but twenty miles apart, and
   that Charles Fox, from his ingratiating manners, is almost universally
   known in France?

   Mr. Deane likewise supposes that William Lee, Esquire continues an
   Alderman of London, and either himself or some other gentleman since,
   under the signature of OBSERVATOR, says that "he has consulted, on this
   point, the Royal Calendar or Annual Register," and finds it true. To
   consult a Calendar to find out a name must be a learned consultation
   indeed. An Alderman of London is neither a place at Court nor a place of
   profit, and if the city chooses not to expel him, it is a proof they are
   very good Whigs; and this is the only proved fact in Mr. Deane's Address.
   But there is, through the whole of it, a barbarous, unmanly and
   unsupported attack on absent characters, which are, perhaps, far superior
   to his own; an eagerness to create suspicions wherever he can catch an
   opportunity; an over-strained desire to be believed; and an affected air
   of giving importance to trifles. He accuses Mr. [Arthur] Lee of incivility
   to the French nation. Mr. Lee, if I can judge by his writing, is too much
   both of a scholar and a gentleman to deserve such a censure. He might with
   great justice complain of Mr. Deane's contracts with individuals; for we
   are fully sensible that the gentlemen which have come from France since
   the arrival of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Lee in that country are of a different
   rank to the generality of those with whom Mr. Deane contracted when alone.
   And this observation will, I believe, explain that charge no ways to Mr.
   Deane's honor.

   Upon the whole, I cannot help considering this publication as one of the
   most irrational performances I ever met with. He seems in it to pay no
   regard to individual safety, nor cares who he may involve in the
   consequences of his quarrel. He mentions names without restraint, and
   stops at no discovery of persons. A public man, in Mr. Deane's former
   character, ought to be as silent as the grave; for who would trust a
   person with a secret who showed such a talent for revealing? Under the
   pretence of doing good he is doing mischief, and in a tumult of his own
   creating will expose and distress himself.

   Mr. Deane's address was calculated to catch several sorts of people: The
   rash, because they are fond of fiery things; the curious, because they are
   fond of curiosities; the weak, because they easily believe; the good,
   because they are unsuspicious; the Tory, because it comforts his
   discontent; the high Whig, because he is jealous of his rights; the man of
   national refinement, because it obscurely hints at national dishonor. The
   clamor, it is true, has been a popular one, and so far as it is the sign
   of a living principle, it is pleasant to see it; but when once understood
   it will amount to nothing, and with the rapidity that it rose it will
   descend.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 14, 1778.

   P.S.-The writer of this has been waited on by a gentleman, whom he
   supposes, by his conversation, to be a friend of Mr. Deane's, and whom Mr.
   Deane, but not any other person, is welcome to know whenever he pleases.
   The gentleman informed the writer that some persons, whom he did not
   mention, had threatened most extraordinary violence against him (the
   writer of this piece) for taking the matter up; the writer asked what,
   whether right or wrong? and likewise informed the gentleman, that he had
   done it solely with a view of putting the public right in a matter which
   they did not understand-that the threat served to increase the necessity,
   and was therefore an incitement to his doing it. The gentleman, after
   expressing his good opinion of, and personal respect for, the writer,
   withdrew.

   TO THE PUBLIC

   In the course of a few days I shall lay before you some very interesting
   facts and materials, by which you will be able to distinguish between
   those who serve you and those who seek to deceive you. There is something
   more in Mr. Deane's affair than many of you are at present acquainted
   with, and as such persons appear to have mistaken the right side for the
   wrong, it is now necessary that the public should know the whole, for upon
   that only can they form a proper judgment.

   If Mr. Deane and his friends are right, then I must be wrong; and if I am
   right, they must be wrong. Either the one or the other is deceiving you.
   There is a premeditated baseness lurking somewhere, and it ought to be
   detected. If it is on my part, you have a right to resent it as you
   please; and even the good I have already rendered, so far from becoming my
   excuse, ought to provoke you the more. I have either disturbed a viperous
   nest to preserve you from being bitten, or deserve to be thrown into one
   myself; and on this ground only, without looking forward or backward, I
   desire to stand or fall in the opinion of every man in America, in
   proportion as I am in this affair of Mr. Deane right or wrong, faithful or
   unfaithful.

   As I shall reserve my principal matter for my next publication, I shall in
   this piece give you only a short history of what may be called the
   underplots, as by your first understanding those, you will be the better
   able to judge of the Characters of the persons concerned.

   Before my piece, signed Common Sense, addressed to Mr. Deane, came out, I
   gave the Printer, Mr. Dunlap, authority to give my real name and place of
   residence to Mr. Deane, that he might know where and on whom to call if he
   found himself injured, or had any thing to resent; and I had reason to
   expect (by the threatenings which Mr. Deane's friend informed me of, and
   who came to my lodgings on purpose, having never been there before) and
   likewise from other intimations, that I should be called upon; and under
   this expectation I took care not to be out of the way, but remained
   constantly at home the two following days. No person came.

   In the next newspaper after my piece came out, some one or more informed
   the public, "That Common Sense would be answered by a person under the
   signature of Plain Truth, and that the writer's name would be left with
   the Printer." And in the piece itself signed Plain Truth, the writer says,
   "his name is left with the Printer." By these repeated assertions the
   public were, no doubt, induced to believe that the author of Plain Truth
   was too much a man of honor and veracity to impose upon them, or to
   conceal himself from the author of Common Sense, when called upon.

   As I saw my own personal character treated, in that piece, with an unjust
   degree of scandalous freedom, I sent my name in a written note to the
   printer (which note he has my leave to show to any person whatever), and
   desired him to give me up the author of Plain Truth. To this I received no
   answer. On the next day I engaged a gentleman, a friend of mine, to call
   on the Printer, and make the same demand, authorising him to use my name
   if he choose; because as one of the public he had a right to make the
   demand in his own person. I choose in this place to relate the exact
   conversation as given me in writing by that gentleman.

   "Pray, Mr. Dunlap, who is the author of Plain Truth?" Mr. Dunlap replied,
   "Aye, that indeed!" The gentleman rejoined, "Surely, I have a right to
   know the author; he has, he says, left his name with you for the
   information of those who choose to know." Mr. Dunlap replied, "Sir, you
   shall know, but Mr. Paine has demanded his name in a letter to me, and he
   has a right to be first informed. He shall be informed in writing this
   evening, and you, if you please, shall know tomorrow morning." The
   gentleman answered, "It is very well." This passed on Wednesday.

   I waited the remainder of that day, and the next till five o'clock, and no
   name was sent to me. I then applied by a written note again to the same
   gentleman, to solicit his further assistance. When he came to me, I told
   him I had received no answer to my demand. He replied, "he had," and at
   the same time mentioned as his opinion, that the name then given to him
   was not, and could not be, the real one. Neither was it given up as the
   real author's name. He then produced a note written to Mr. Dunlap, which
   note Mr. Dunlap had just then given to him to communicate to me. The note
   has neither date or place. In said note, the name of "M. Clarkson" who, as
   I am told, is an Aid de Camp to General Arnold, is given up as the person
   who undertakes to "avow the piece under the signature of Plain Truth, in
   the Pennsylvania Packet of December 21st."

   As I consider this proceeding to be a low and pitiful evasion, both
   towards the public and myself personally, I shall therefore treat it as
   all such proceedings deserve. And if this young man, whom I do not know
   even by sight, has been so weak, or influenced by promises or other
   motives, to stand in a gap to screen an unseen incendiary, and that in a
   matter he has no business with, and can know scarcely anything of, he
   truly deserves that kind of chastisement which the law best inflicts. I
   shall therefore order an Attorney to prosecute him, as a party concerned
   in publishing a false malicious libel, tending to injure the reputation of
   the "Secretary for Foreign Affairs," which mode of proceeding will
   likewise afford him an opportunity of proving what he has, I believe, so
   unnecessarily made his own. And when I can discover the real author or
   authors, I shall serve them in the same manner, as by their skulking
   cowardice they deserve no other treatment.

   THOMAS PAINE,

   Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and Author of all the Writings under the
   Signature of Common Sense.

   PHILADELPHIA, December 28, 1778.

   P. S. The above was to have appeared in the paper of Saturday last, and
   was sent to the Printer for that purpose on Friday noon; but as the
   gentleman alluded to in the above was not present to explain the
   conversation which passed between him and Mr. Dunlap, it was therefore
   found necessary to defer it.

   In justice to Mr. Dunlap, I think it proper to mention that his delay in
   giving up the writer's name was because it was not left with him; and
   that, as far as I can learn, he was obliged to make repeated applications
   to get even that which is now given.

   To THE PUBLIC ON MR. DEANE'S AFFAIR

   Hoping this to be my last on the subject of Mr. Deane's conduct and
   address, I shall therefore make a few remarks on what has already appeared
   in the papers, and furnish you with some interesting and explanatory
   facts; and whatever I may conceive necessary to say of myself will
   conclude the piece. As it is my design to make those that can scarcely
   read understand, shall therefore avoid every literary ornament, and put it
   in language as plain as the alphabet.

   I desire the public to understand that this is not a personal dispute
   between Mr. Deane and me, but is a matter of business in which they are
   more interested than they seemed at first to be apprised of. I rather
   wonder that no person was curious enough to ask in the papers how affairs
   stood between Congress and Mr. Deane as to money matters. And likewise,
   what it was that Mr. Deane has so repeatedly applied to the Congress for
   without success. Perhaps those two questions, properly asked, and justly
   answered, would have unravelled a great part of the mystery, and explained
   the reason why he threw out, at such a particular time, such a strange
   address. They might likewise have asked, whether there had been any former
   dispute between Mr. Deane and Arthur or William Lee, and what it was
   about? Mr. Deane's round-about charges against the Lees are accompanied
   with a kind of rancor that differs exceedingly from public-spirited zeal.
   For my part, I have but a very slender opinion of those patriots, if they
   can be called such, who never appear till provoked to it by a personal
   quarrel, and then blaze away, the hero of their awn tale, and in a
   whirlwind of their own raising; such men are very seldom what the populace
   mean by the word "staunch," and it is only by a continuance of service
   that any public can become a judge of a man's principles.

   When I first took up this matter, I expected at least to be abused, and I
   have not been disappointed. It was the last and only refuge they had and,
   thank God, I had nothing to dread from it. I might have escaped it if I
   would, either by being silent, or by joining in the tumult. A gentleman, a
   Member of Congress, an associate, I believe, of Mr. Deane's, and one whom
   I would wish had not a hand in the piece signed Plain Truth, very politely
   asked me, a few days before Common Sense to Mr. Deane came out, whether on
   that subject I was pro or con. I replied, I knew no pro or con, nor any
   other sides than right or wrong.

   Mr. Deane had objected to my putting the signature of Common Sense to my
   address to him, and the gentleman who came to my lodgings urged the same
   objections; their reasons for so doing may, I think, be easily guessed at.
   The signature has, I believe, an extensive reputation, and which, I trust,
   will never be forfeited while in my possession. As I do not choose to
   comply with the proposal that was made to me for changing it, therefore
   Mr. Plain Truth, as he calls himself, and his connections, may endeavor to
   take off from the credit of the signature, by a torrent of low-toned abuse
   without wit, matter or sentiment.

   Had Mr. Deane confined himself to his proper line of conduct, he would
   never have been interrupted by me, or exposed himself to suspicious
   criticism. But departing from this, he has thrown himself on the ocean of
   the public, where nothing but the firmest integrity can preserve him from
   becoming a wreck. A smooth and flattering tale may do for a while, but
   unless it can be supported with facts, and maintained by the most
   incontestable proof, it will fall to the ground and leave the inventor in
   the lurch.

   On the first view of things, there is something in Mr. Deane's conduct
   which must appear mysterious to every disinterested man, if he will but
   give himself time to reflect. Mr. Deane has been arrived in America, and
   in this city, upwards of five months, and had he been possessed of any
   secrets which affected, or seemed to affect, the interest of America, or
   known any kind of treachery, misconduct, or neglect of duty in any of the
   other Commissioners, or in any other person, he ought, as an honest man,
   to have disclosed it immediately on his arrival, either to  the Committee
   for Foreign Affairs, of which I have the honor to be Secretary, or to
   Congress. Mr. Deane has done neither, notwithstanding he has had two
   audiences with Congress in August last, and might at any time have laid
   his written information before them, or before the Committee, through whom
   all his foreign concerns had passed, and in whose hands, or rather in
   mine, are lodged all his political correspondence, and those of other
   Commissioners.

   From an unwillingness to expose Mr. Deane and his adherents too much, I
   contented myself in my first piece with showing their inconsistency rather
   than their intentions, and gave them room to retract by concealing their
   discredit. It is necessary that I should now speak a plainer language.

   The public have totally mistaken this matter, and when they come to
   understand it rightly, they will see it in a very different light to what
   they at first supposed it. They seemed to conceive, and great pains have
   been taken to make them believe, that Mr. Deane had repeatedly applied to
   Congress to obtain an audience, in order to lay before them some great and
   important discoveries, and that the Congress had refused to hear such
   information. It is, gentlemen, no such thing. If Mr. Deane or any one else
   had told you so, they have imposed upon you.

   If you attend to a part of Mr. Deane's address to you, you will find
   there, even from his own account, what it was that he wanted an interview
   with Congress for, viz. to get some how or other through his own perplexed
   affairs, and obtain an audience of leave and departure that he might
   embark for France, and which if he could have obtained, there is every
   reason to believe, he would have quitted America in silence, and that the
   public would never have been favored with his address, nor I plagued with
   the trouble of putting it to rights. The part which I allude to is this
   "and having placed my papers and yours in, safety, I left Paris, in full
   confidence that I should not be detained in America," to which he adds
   this curious expression, "on the business I was sent for." To be
   "detained" at home is a new transposition of ideas, especially in a man
   who had been absent from it two years and a half, and serves to show that
   Mr. Deane was become so wonderfully foreignized that he had quite
   forgotten poor Connecticut.

   As I shall have frequent occasions to make use of the name of Congress, I
   request you to suspend all kind of opinions on any supposed obligations
   which I am said to lie under to that body, till you hear what I have to
   say in the conclusion of this address, for if Mr. Deane's accounts stand
   as clear with them as mine do, he might very easily have brought his
   papers from France. I have several times repeated, and I again repeat it,
   that my whole design in taking this matter up, was and is, to prevent the
   public being imposed upon, and the event must and will convince them of
   it.

   I now proceed to put the affair into such a straight line that you cannot
   misunderstand it.

   Mr. Deane wrote his address to you some time in November, and kept it by
   him in order to publish or not as it might suit his purpose.2 On the 30th
   day of the same month he applied by letter to Congress, and what do you
   think it was for? To give them any important information? No. To "tell
   them what he has wrote to you?" No, it was to acquaint them that he had
   missed agreeable opportunities of returning to France; dismal misfortune
   indeed! And that the season (of the year) is now becoming as pressing as
   the business which calls him back, and therefore he earnestly entreated
   the attention of Congress, to what? To his great information? No, to his
   important discoveries? No, but to his own situation and requests. These
   are, I believe, his own words.

   Now it only remains to know whether Mr. Deane's official affairs were in a
   fit position for him to be permitted to quit America or not; and I trust,
   that when I tell you, I have been Secretary for Foreign Affairs almost two
   years, you will allow that I must be some judge of the matter.

   You have already heard what Mr. Deane's application to Congress was for.
   And as one of the public, under the well known signature of Common Sense,
   I humbly conceive, that the Congress have done that which as a faithful
   body of Representatives they ought to do, that is, they ordered an inquiry
   into the state of foreign affairs and accounts which Mr. Deane had been
   entrusted with, before they could, with justice to you, grant the request
   he asked. And this was the more necessary to be done, because Mr. Deane
   says he has left his papers and accounts behind him. Did ever any steward,
   when called upon, to surrender up his stewardship make such a weak and
   frivolous excuse? Mr. Deane saw himself not only recalled but superseded
   in his office by another person, and he could have no right to think he
   should return, nor any pretense to come away without the necessary
   credentials.

   His friend and associate, and perhaps partner too, Mr. Plain Truth, says,
   that I have endeavored in my address, to "throw out a suggestion that Mr.
   Deane is considered [by] Congress as a defaulter of public money." The
   gentlemen seem to wince before they are touched. I have nowhere said so,
   but this I will say, that his accounts are not satisfactory. Mr. Plain
   Truth endeavors to palliate what he cannot contradict, and with a seeming
   triumph assures the public "that Mr. Deane not long after his arrival laid
   before Congress a general state of the receipts and expenditures of the
   monies which passed through his hands"; to which Mr. Plain Truth subjoins
   the following extraordinary apology: "It is true the account was not
   accompanied with all the vouchers for the particular expenditures." And
   why not I ask? for without those it was no account at all; it was what the
   sailors call a boot account, so much money gone and the Lord knows for
   what. Mr. Deane had secretaries and clerks, and ought to have known better
   than to produce such an account to Congress, especially as his colleague
   Arthur Lee had declared in an office letter, which is in my possession,
   that he had no concern in Mr. Deane's contracts.

   Neither does the excuse, which his whirligig friend Mr. Plain Truth makes
   for him, apply to his case; this random shot gentleman, in order to bring
   him as easily off as possible, says, "that any person in the least
   conversant with business, knows the time which is requisite for calling in
   manufacturers' and tradesmen's bills, and prepare accounts and vouchers
   for a final settlement"; and this he mentions because Mr. Deane received
   his order of recall the 4th of March, and left Paris the 31st: here is,
   however, four weeks within a day. I shall make three remarks upon this
   curious excuse.

   First, it is contradictory. Mr. Deane could not obtain the total or
   general expenditure without having the particulars, therefore he must be
   in the possession of the particulars. He surely did not pass away money
   without taking receipts, and what was due upon credit, he could only know
   from the bills delivered in.

   Secondly, Mr. Deane's contracts did not lay in the retail way, and
   therefore were easily collected.

   Thirdly, The accounts which it was Mr. Deane's particular duty to settle
   were those which he contracted in the time of being only a commercial
   agent in 1776, before the arrival of Dr. Franklin and Arthur Lee, which
   separate agency of his expired upwards of fifteen months

   before he left France,-and surely that was time enough,-and in which
   period of his agency, there happened an unexplained contract of about two
   hundred thousand pounds sterling. But more of this when I come to remark
   on the ridiculous puffs with which Mr. Plain Truth has set off Mr. Deane's
   pretended services in France.

   Mr. Deane has not only left the public papers and accounts behind him, but
   he has given no information to Congress, where or in whose hands they are;
   he says in his address to you, that he has left them in a safe place, and
   this is all which is known of the matter. Does this look like business?
   Has it an open and candid or a mysterious and suspicious appearance? Or
   would it have been right in Congress to have granted Mr. Deane an audience
   of leave and departure in this embarrassed state of his affairs? And
   because they have not, his ready written November address has been thrown
   out to abuse them and amuse you by directing you to another object; and
   myself, for endeavoring to unriddle confusion, have been loaded with
   reproach by his partisans and partners, and represented as a writer, who
   like an unprincipled lawyer had let himself out for pay. Charges which the
   propagators of them know to be false, because some, who have encouraged
   the report, are Members of Congress themselves, and know my situation to
   be directly the reverse. But this I shall explain in the conclusion; and I
   give the gentlemen notice of it, that if they can make out anything
   against me, or prove that I ever received a single farthing, public or
   private, for any thing I ever wrote, they may convict me publicly, and if
   they do not, I hope they will be honest enough to take shame to themselves
   for the falsehood they have supported. And I likewise request that they
   would inform the public what my salary as Secretary for Foreign Affairs
   is, otherwise I shall be obliged to do it myself. I shall not spare them
   and I beg they would not spare me. But to return-

   There is something in this concealment of papers that looks like an
   embezzlement. Mr. Deane came so privately from France, that he even
   concealed his departure from his colleague Arthur Lee, of which he
   complains by a letter in my office, and consequently the papers are not in
   his hands; and had he left them with Dr. Franklin he would undoubtedly
   have taken the Doctor's receipt for them, and left nobody to "guess," at
   what Mr. Deane meant by a safe place: A man may leave his own private
   affairs in the hands of a friend, but the papers of a nation are of
   another nature, and ought never to be trusted with any person whatever out
   of the direct line of business. This I conceive to be another reason which
   justifies Congress in not granting Mr. Deane an audience of leave and
   departure till they are assured where those papers are. Mr. Deane might
   have been taken at sea, he might have died or been cast away on his
   passage back from France, or he might have been settled there, as Madame
   D'Eon did in England, and quarreled afterwards as she did with the power
   that employed him. Many accidents might have happened by which those
   papers and accounts might have been totally lost, the secrets got into the
   hands of the enemy, and the possibility of settling the expenditure of
   public money forever prevented. No apology can be made for Mr. Deane, as
   to the danger of the seas, or their being taken by the enemy, in his
   attempt to bring them over himself, because it ought always to be
   remembered that he came in a fleet of twelve sail of the line.3

   I shall now quit this part of the subject to take notice of a paragraph in
   Mr. Plain Truth.

   In my piece to Mr. Deane I said, that his address was dated in November,
   without any day of the month, that on the last day of that month he
   applied to Congress, that on the 1st of December the Congress resolved to
   investigate the state of their foreign affairs, of which Mr. Deane had
   notice, and that on the fourth he informed them of his receiving that
   notification and expressed his thanks, yet that on the fifth he published
   his extraordinary address.

   Mr. Plain Truth, in commenting upon this arrangement of facts has helped
   me to a new discovery. He says, that Mr. Deane's thanks of the fourth of
   December were only expressed to the President, Henry Laurens Esqr: for
   personally informing him of the resolution and other attention to his
   Affairs, and not, as I had said, to Congress for the resolution itself. I
   give him credit for this, and believe it to be true; for my opinion of the
   matter is, that Mr. Deane's views were to get off without any inquiry, and
   that the resolution referred to was his great disappointment. By all
   accounts which have been given both by Mr. Deane's friends and myself, we
   all agree in this, that Mr. Deane knew of the resolution of Congress
   before he published his address, and situated as he is he could not help
   knowing it two or three days before his address came out. Why then did he
   publish it, since the very thing which he ought to have asked for, viz. an
   inquiry into his affairs was ordered to be immediately gone into?

   I wish in this place to step for a moment from the floor of office, and
   press it on every State, to inquire what mercantile connections any of
   their late or present delegates have had or now have with Mr. Deane, and
   that a precedent might not be wanting, it is important that this State,
   Pennsylvania should begin.

   The uncommon fury which has been spread to support Mr. Deane cannot be
   altogether for his sake. Those who were the original propagators of it,
   are not remarkable for gratitude. If they excel in anything it is in the
   contrary principle and a selfish attachment to their own interest. It
   would suit their plan exceedingly well to have Mr. Deane appointed
   Ambassador to Holland, because so situated, he would make a very
   convenient partner in trade or a useful factor.

   In order to rest Mr. Deane on the shoulders of the public, he has been set
   off with the most pompous puffs-The Saviour of his Country -the Patriot of
   America-the True Friend of the Public-the Great Supporter of the cause in
   Europe,-and a thousand other full-blown bubbles, equally ridiculous and
   equally untrue. Never were the public more wretchedly imposed upon. An
   attempt was made to call a town meeting to return him thanks and to march
   in a body to Congress to demand justice for Mr. Deane. And this brings me
   to a part in Mr. Plain Truth's address to me, in which he speaks of Mr.
   Deane's services in France, and defies me to disapprove them. If any late
   or present Member, of Congress has been concerned in writing that piece, I
   think it necessary to tell him, that he either knows very little of the
   state of foreign affairs, or ought to blush in thus attempting to rob a
   friendly nation, France, of her honors, to bestow them on a man who so
   little deserves them.

   Mr. Deane was sent to France in the Spring, 1776, as a Commercial Agent,
   under the authority of the Committee which is now styled the Committee for
   Foreign Affairs. He had no commission of any kind from Congress; and his
   instructions were to assume no other character but that of a merchant; yet
   in this line of action Mr. Plain Truth has the ignorance to dub him a
   "public Minister" and likewise says,

   "that before the first of December, after his arrival he had formed and
   cultivated the esteem of a valuable political and commercial connection,
   not only in France but in other parts of Europe, laid the foundation of a
   public loan, procured thirty thousand stand of arms, thirty thousand suits
   of clothes, more than two hundred arid fifty pieces of brass cannon, and a
   great amount of tents and military stores, provided vessels to transport
   them, and in spite of various and almost inconceivable obstructions great
   part of these articles were shipped and arrived in America before the
   operations of the campaign in 1777." To which Mr. Plain Truth adds, "That
   he has had the means of being acquainted with all these circumstances,
   avows them to be facts, and defies Common Sense or any other person to
   disprove them."

   Poor Mr. Plain Truth, and his avower Mr. Clarkson, have most unfortunately
   for them challenged the wrong person, and fallen into the right hands when
   they fell into mine, for without stirring a step from the room I am
   writing in, or asking a single question of any one, I have it in my power,
   not only to contradict but disprove it.

   It is, I confess, a nice point to touch upon, but the necessity of
   undeceiving the public with respect to Mr. Deane, and the right they have
   to know the early friendship of the French nation towards them at the time
   of their greatest wants, will justify my doing it. I feel likewise the
   less difficulty in it, because the whole affair respecting those supplies
   has been in the hands of the enemy at least twelve months, and
   consequently the necessity for concealing it is superseded. Besides which,
   the two nations, viz. France and England, being now come to an open
   rupture makes the secret unnecessary. It was immediately on the discovery
   of this affair by the enemy fifteen months ago, that the British Ministry
   began to change their ground and planned what they call their Conciliatory
   Bills. They got possession of this secret by stealing the dispatches of
   October, 1777, which should have come over by Captain Folger, and this
   likewise explains the controversy which the British Commissioners carried
   on with Congress, in attempting to prove that England had planned what
   they called her Conciliatory Bills, before France moved towards a treaty;
   for even admitting that assertion to be true, the case is, that they
   planned those bills in consequence of the knowledge they had stolen.4

   The supplies here alluded to, are those which were sent from France in the
   Amphitrite, Seine and Mercury about two years ago. They had at first the
   appearance of a present, but whether so, or on credit, the service was
   nevertheless a great and friendly one, and though only part of them
   arrived the kindness is the same. A considerable time afterwards the same
   supplies appeared under the head of a charge amounting to about two
   hundred thousand pounds sterling, and it is the unexplained contract I
   alluded to when I spoke of the pompous puffs made use of to support Mr.
   Deane. On the appearance of this charge the Congress were exceedingly
   embarrassed as to what line of conduct to pursue. To be insensible of a
   favor, which has before now been practised between nations, would have
   implied a want of just conceptions; and to have refused it would have been
   a species of proud rusticity. To have asked the question was both
   difficult and awkward; to take no notice of it would have been
   insensibility itself; and to have seemed backward in payment, if they were
   to be paid for, would have impeached both the justice and the credit of
   America. In this state of difficulties such inquiries were made as were
   judged necessary, in order that Congress might know how to proceed. Still
   nothing satisfactory could be obtained. The answer which Mr. Deane signed
   so lately as February 16th last past (and who ought to know most of the
   matter, because the shipping the supplies was while he acted alone) is as
   ambiguous as the rest of his conduct. I will venture to give it, as there
   is no political secret in it and the matter wants explanation.

   "Hear that Mr. Beaumarchais has sent over a person to demand a large sum
   of you on account of arms, ammunition, etc.,-think it will be best for you
   to leave that matter to be settled here (France), as there is a mixture in
   it of public and private concern which you cannot so well develop."

   Why did not Mr. Deane complete the contract so as it might be developed,
   or at least state to Congress any difficulties that had arisen? When Mr.
   Deane had his two audiences with Congress in August last, he objected, or
   his friends for him, against his answering the questions that might be
   asked him, and the ground upon which the objection was made, was, because
   a man could not legally be compelled to answer questions that might tend
   to criminate himself.-Yet this is the same Mr. Deane whose address you saw
   in the Pennsylvania Packet of December 5 signed Silas Deane.

   Having thus shown the loose manner of Mr. Deane's doing business in
   France, which is rendered the more intricate by his leaving his papers
   behind, or his not producing them; I come now to inquire into what degree
   of merit or credit Mr. Deane is entitled to as to the procuring these
   supplies, either as a present or a purchase.

   Mr. Plain Truth has given him the whole. Mr. Plain Truth therefore knows
   nothing of the, matter, or something worse. If Mr. Deane or any other
   gentleman will procure an order from Congress to inspect an account in my
   office, or any of Mr. Deane's friends in Congress will take the trouble of
   coming themselves, I will give him or them my attendance and show them in
   a handwriting which Mr. Deane is well acquainted with, that the supplies,
   he so pompously plumes himself upon, were promised and engaged, and that
   as a present, before he ever arrived in France, and the part that fell to
   Mr. Deane was only to see it done, and how he has performed that service,
   the public are now acquainted with. The last paragraph in the account is,
   "Upon Mr. Deane's arrival in France the business went into his hands and
   the aids were at length embarked in the Amphitrite, Mercury and Seine."

   What will Mr. Deane or his aide-de-camp say to this, or what excuse will
   they make now? If they have met with any cutting truths from me, they must
   thank themselves for it. My address to Mr. Deane was not only moderate but
   civil, and he and his adherents had much better have submitted to it
   quietly, than provoked more material matter to appear against them. I had
   at that time all the facts in my hands which I have related since, or
   shall yet relate in my reply. The only thing I aimed at in the address,
   was, to give out just as much as might prevent the public from being so
   grossly imposed upon by them, and yet save Mr. Deane and his adherents
   from appearing too wretched and despicable. My fault was a misplaced
   tenderness, which they must now be fully sensible of, and the misfortune
   to them, is, that I have not yet done.

   Had Mr. Plain Truth only informed the Public that Mr. Deane had been
   industrious in promoting and forwarding the sending the supplies, his
   assertion would have passed uncontradicted by me, because I must naturally
   suppose that Mr. Dean would do no otherwise; but to give him the whole and
   sole honor of procuring them, and that, without yielding any part of the
   honor to the public spirit and good disposition of those who furnished
   them, and who likewise must in every shape have put up with the total loss
   of them had America been overpowered by her enemies, is, in my opinion,
   placing the reputation and affection of our allies not only in a
   disadvantageous, but in an unjust point of view, and concealing from the
   public what they ought to know.

    Mr. Plain Truth declares that he knows all the circumstances, why then
   did he not place them in a proper line, and give the public a clear
   information how they arose? The proposal for sending over those supplies,
   appears to have been originally made by some public spirited gentleman in
   France, before ever Mr. Deane arrived there, or was known or heard of in
   that country, and to have been communicated (personally by Mr.
   Beaumarchais, the gentleman mentioned in the letter signed J. L. which
   letter is given at length by Mr. Plain Truth) to Mr. Arthur Lee while
   resident in London about three years ago. From Mr. B's manner of
   expression, Mr. Lee understood the supplies to be a present, and has
   signified it in that light. It is very easy to see that if America had
   miscarried, they must have been a present, which probably adds explanation
   to the matter. But Mr. Deane is spoken of by Mr. Plain Truth, as having an
   importance of his own, and procuring those supplies through that
   importance; whereas he could only rise and fall with the country that
   empowered him to act, and be in or out of credit, as to money matters,
   from the same cause and in the same proportion; and every body must
   suppose, that there were greater and more original wheels at work than he
   was capable of setting in motion. Exclusive of the matter being begun
   before Mr. Deane's arrival, Mr. Plain Truth has given him the whole merit
   of every part of the transaction. America and France are wholly left out
   of the question, the former as to her growing importance and credit, from
   which all Mr. Deane's consequence was derived, and the latter, as to her
   generosity in furnishing those supplies, at a time, when the risk of
   losing them appears to have been as great as our want of them.

   I have always understood thus much of the matter, that if we did not
   succeed no payment would be required, and I think myself fully entitled to
   believe, and to publish my belief, that whether Mr. Deane had arrived in
   France or not, or any other gentleman in his stead, those same supplies
   would have found their way to America. But as the nature of the contract
   has not been explained by any of Mr. Deane's letters and is left in
   obscurity by the account he signed the 16th of February last, which I have
   already quoted, therefore the full explanation must rest upon other
   authority.

   I have been the more explicit on this subject, not so much on Mr. Deane's
   account, as from a principle of public justice. It shows, in the first
   instance, that the greatness of the American cause drew, at its first
   beginning, the attention of Europe, and that the justness of it was such
   as appeared to merit support; and in the second instance, that those who
   are now her allies, prefaced that alliance by an early and generous
   friendship; yet, that we might not attribute too much to human or
   auxiliary aid, so unfortunate were those supplies, that only one ship out
   of the three arrived. The Mercury and Seine fell into the hands of the
   enemy.

   Mr. Deane, in his address, speaks of himself as "sacrificed for the
   aggrandizement of others" and promises to inform the public of "what he
   has done and what he has suffered" What Mr. Deane means by being
   sacrificed the Lord knows, and what he has suffered is equally as
   mysterious. It was his good fortune to be situated in an elegant country
   and at a public charge, while we were driven about from pillar to post. He
   appears to know but little of the hardships and losses which his
   countrymen underwent in the period of his fortunate absence. It fell not
   to his lot to turn out to a winter's campaign, and sleep without tent or
   blanket. He returned to America when the danger was over, and has since
   that time suffered no personal hardship. What then are Mr. Deane's
   sufferings and what the sacrifices he complains of? Has he lost money in
   the public service? I believe not. Has he got any? That I cannot tell. I
   can assure him that I have not, and he, if he pleases, may make the same
   declaration.

   Surely the Congress might recall Mr. Deane if they thought proper, without
   an insinuated charge of injustice for so doing. The authority of America
   must be little indeed when she cannot change a Commissioner without being
   insulted by him. And I conceive Mr. Deane as speaking in the most
   disrespectful language of the authority of America when he says in his
   address, that in December 1776 he was "honored with one colleague, and
   saddled with another." Was Mr. Deane to dictate who should be
   Commissioner, and who should not? It was time, however, to saddle him, as
   he calls it, with somebody, as I shall show before I conclude.

   When we have elected our Representatives, either in Congress or in the
   Assembly, it is for our own good that we support them in the execution of
   that authority they derive from us. If Congress is to be abused by every
   one whom they may appoint or remove, there is an end to all useful
   delegation of power, and the public accounts in the hands of individuals
   will never be settled. There has, I believe, been too much of this work
   practised already, and it is time that the public should now make those
   matters a point of consideration. But who will begin the disagreeable
   talk?

   I look on the independence of America to be as firmly established as that
   of any country which is at war. Length of time is no guarantee when arms
   are to decide the fate of a nation. Hitherto our whole anxiety has been
   absorbed in the means for supporting our independence, and we have paid
   but little attention to the expenditure of money; yet we see it daily
   depreciating, and how should it be otherwise when so few public accounts
   are settled, and new emissions continually going on?-I will venture to
   mention one circumstance which I hope will be sufficient to awaken the
   attention of the public to this subject. In October, 1777, some books of
   the Commercial Committee, in which, among other things, were kept the
   accounts of Mr. Thomas Morris, appointed a commercial agent in France,
   were by Mr. Robert Morris's request taken into his possession to be
   settled, he having obtained from the council of this State six months'
   leave of absence from Congress to settle his affairs. In February
   following those books were called for by Congress, but not being completed
   were not delivered. In September, 1778 Mr. Morris returned them to
   Congress, in, or nearly in, the same unsettled state he took them, which,
   with the death of Mr. Thomas Morris, may probably involve those accounts
   in further embarrassment. The amount of expenditure on those books is
   considerably above two millions of dollars.5

   I now quit this subject to take notice of a paragraph in Mr. Plain Truth,
   relative to myself. It never fell to my lot to have to do with a more
   illiberal set of men than those of Mr. Deane's advocates who were
   concerned in writing that piece. They have neither wit, manners nor
   honesty; an instance of which I shall now produce. In speaking of Mr.
   Deane's contracts with individuals in France I said in my address "We are
   all fully sensible, that the gentlemen who have come from France since the
   arrival of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Lee in that Country are of a different
   rank from the generality of those with whom Mr. Deane contracted when
   alone." These are the exact words I used in my address.

   Mr. Plain Truth has misquoted the above paragraph into his piece, and that
   in a manner, which shows him to be a man of little reading and less
   principle. The method in which he has quoted it is as follows: "All are
   fully sensible that the gentlemen who came from France since the arrival
   of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Lee in that country, are of a different rank from
   those with whom Mr. Deane contracted when acting separately."  Thus by
   leaving out the words "the generality of," Mr. Plain Truth has altered the
   sense of my expression, so as to suit a most malicious purpose in his own,
   which could be no other, than that of embroiling me with the French
   gentlemen that have remained; whereas it is evident, that my mode of
   expression was intended to do justice to such characters as Fleury and
   Touzard, by making a distinction they are clearly entitled to. Mr. Plain
   Truth not content with unjustly subjecting me to the misconceptions of
   those gentlemen, with whom even explanation was difficult on account of
   the language, but in addition to his injustice, endeavored to provoke them
   to it by calling on them, and reminding them that they were the "Guardians
   of their own honor" And I have reason to believe, that either Mr. Plain
   Truth or some of the party did not even stop here, but went so far as
   personally to excite them on. Mr. Fleury came to my lodgings and
   complained that I had done him great injustice, but that he was sure I did
   not intend it, because he was certain that I knew him better. He confessed
   to me that he was pointed at and told that I meant him, and he withal
   desired, that as I knew his services and character, that I would put the
   matter right in the next paper. I endeavored to explain to him that the
   mistake was not mine, and we parted. I do not remember that in the course
   of my reading I ever met with a more illiberal and malicious misquotation,
   and the more so when all the circumstances are taken with it. Yet this
   same Mr. Plain Truth, whom no body knows, has the impertinence to give
   himself out to be a man of "education" and to inform the public that "he
   is not a writer from inclination much less by profession" to which he
   might safely have added, still less by capacity, and least of all by
   principle. As Mr. Clarkson has undertaken to avow the piece signed Plain
   Truth, I shall therefore consider him as legally accountable for the
   apparent malicious intentions of this misquotation, and he may get whom he
   pleases to speak or write a defense of him.

   I conceive that the general distinction I referred to between those with
   whom Mr. Deane contracted when alone, and those who have come from France
   since the arrival of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Lee in that Country, is
   sufficiently warranted. That gallant and amiable officer and volunteer the
   Marquis de Lafayette, and some others whom Mr. Plain Truth mentions, did
   not come from France till after the arrival of the additional
   Commissioners, and proves my assertion to be true. My remark is confined
   to the many and unnecessary ones with which Mr. Deane burdened and
   distracted the army. If he acquired any part of his popularity in France
   by this means he made the continent pay smartly for it. Many thousand
   pounds it cost America, and that in money totally sunk, on account of Mr.
   Deane's injudicious contracts, and what renders it the more unpardonable
   is that by the instructions he took with him, he was restricted from
   making them, and consequently by having no authority had an easy answer to
   give to solicitations. It was Doctor Franklin's answer as soon as he
   arrived and might have been Mr. Deane's. Gentlemen of science or
   literature or conversant with the polite or useful arts, will, I presume,
   always find a welcome reception in America, at least with persons of a
   liberal cast, and with the bulk of the people.

   In speaking of Mr. Deane's contracts with foreign officers, I concealed
   out of pity to him a circumstance that must have sufficiently shown the
   necessity of recalling him, and, either his great want of judgment, or the
   danger of trusting him with discretionary power. It is no less than that
   of his throwing out a proposal, in one of his last foreign letters, for
   contracting with a German prince 4 1 to command the American army. For my
   own part I was no ways surprised when I read it, though I presume almost
   everybody else will be so when they hear it, and I think when he got to
   this length it was time to saddle him.

   Mr. Deane was directed by the Committee which employed him to engage four
   able engineers in France, and beyond this he had neither authority nor
   commission. But disregarding his instructions (a fault criminal in a
   negotiator) he proceeded through the several degrees of subalterns, to
   captains, majors, lieutenant colonels, colonels, brigadier generals and at
   last to major generals; he fixed their rank, regulated their command, and
   on some, I believe, he bestowed a pension. At this stage, I set him down
   for a commander-in-chief, and his next letter proved me prophetic. Mr.
   Plain Truth, in the course of his numerous encomiums on Mr. Deane, says,
   that-

   "The letter of the Count de Vergennes, written by order of his Most
   Christian Majesty to Congress, speaking of Mr. Deane in the most honorable
   manner, and the letter from that Minister in his own character, written
   not in the language of a courtier, but in that of a person who felt what
   he expressed, would be sufficient to counterbalance, not only the opinions
   of the writer of the address to Mr. Deane, but even of characters of more
   influence, who may vainly endeavor to circulate notions of his
   insignificancy and unfitness for a public minister."

   The supreme authority of one country, however different may be its mode,
   will ever pay a just regard to that of another, more especially when in
   alliance. But those letters can extend no further than to such parts of
   Mr. Deane's conduct as came under the immediate notice of the Court as a
   public Minister, or a political agent; and cannot be sup- posed to
   interfere with such other parts as might be disapproved in him here as a
   contractor or a commercial agent, and can in no place be applied as an
   extenuation of any imprudence of his either there or since his return;
   besides which, letters of this kind, are as much intended to compliment
   the power that employs, as the person employed; and upon the whole, I fear
   Mr. Deane has presumed too much upon the polite friendship of that nation,
   and engrossed to himself, a regard, that was partly intended to express,
   through him, an affection to the continent.

   Mr. Deane should likewise recollect that the early appearance of any
   gentleman from America, was a circumstance, so agreeable to the nation, he
   had the honor of appearing at, that he must have managed unwisely indeed
   to have avoided popularity. For as the poet says,

   "Fame then was cheap, and the first comers sped."

   The last line of the couplet is not applicable

   "Which they have since preserved by being dead."

   From the pathetic manner in which Mr. Deane speaks of his "sufferings" and
   the little concern he seems to have of ours, it may not be improper to
   inform him, that there is kept in this city a "Book of Sufferings," into
   which, by the assistance of some of his connections, he may probably get
   them registered.6 I have not interest enough myself to afford him any
   service in this particular, though I am a friend to all religions, and no
   personal enemy to those who may, in this place, suppose themselves alluded
   to.

   I can likewise explain to Mr. Deane, the reason of one of his sufferings
   which I know he has complained of. After the Declaration of Independence
   was passed, Mr. Deane thought it a great hardship that he was not
   authorized to announce it in form to the Court of France, and this
   circumstance has been mentioned as a seeming inattention in Congress. The
   reason of it was this, and I mention it from my own knowledge. Mr. Deane
   was at that time only a commercial agent, without any commission from
   Congress, and consequently could not appear at Court with the rank
   suitable to the formality of such an occasion. A new commission was
   therefore necessary to be issued by Congress, and that honor was purposely
   reserved for Doctor Franklin, whose long services in the world, and
   established reputation in Europe, rendered him the fittest person in
   America to execute such a great and original design; and it was likewise
   paying a just attention to the honor of France by sending so able and
   extraordinary a character to announce the Declaration.

   Mr. Plain Truth, who sticks at nothing to carry Mr. Deane through
   everything thick or thin, says:

   "It may not be improper to remark that when he (Mr. Deane) arrived in
   France, the opinion of people there, and in the different parts of Europe,
   not only with respect to the merits, but the probable issue of the
   contest, had by no means acquired that consistency which they had at the
   time of Dr. Franklin's and Mr. Arthur Lee's arrival in that kingdom."

   Mr. Plain Truth is not a bad historian. For it was the fate of Dr.
   Franklin and Mr. Lee to arrive in France at the very worst of times. Their
   first appearance there was followed by a long series of ill fortune on our
   side. Doctor Franklin went from America in October, 1776, at which time
   our affairs were taking a wrong turn. The loss on Long Island, and the
   evacuation of New York happened before he went, and all the succeeding
   retreats and misfortunes through the course of that year, till the scale
   was again turned by taking the Hessians at Trenton on the 26th day of
   December, followed day by day after him. And I have been informed by a
   gentleman from France, that the philosophical ease and cheerful fortitude,
   with which Dr. Franklin heard of or announced those tidings, contributed
   greatly towards lessening the real weight of them on the minds of the
   Europeans.

   Mr. Deane speaking of himself in his address says, "While it was safe to
   be silent my lips were closed. Necessity hath opened them and necessity
   must excuse this effort to serve, by informing you." After which he goes
   on with his address. In this paragraph there is an insinuation thrown out
   by Mr. Deane that some treason was on foot, which he had happily
   discovered, and which his duty to his country compelled him to reveal. The
   public had a right to be alarmed, and the alarm was carefully kept by
   those who at first contrived it. Now, if after this, Mr. Deane has nothing
   to inform them of, he must sink into nothing. When a public man stakes his
   reputation in this manner he likewise stakes all his future credit on the
   performance of his obligation.

   I am not writing to defend Mr. Arthur or Mr. William Lee, I leave their
   conduct to defend itself; and I would with as much freedom make an attack
   on either of these gentlemen, if there was a public necessity for it, as
   on Mr. Deane. In my address I mentioned Colonel R. H. Lee with some
   testimony of honorable respect, because I am personally acquainted with
   that gentleman's integrity and abilities as a public man, and in the
   circle of my acquaintance I know but few that have equalled, and none that
   have exceeded him, particularly in his ardor to bring foreign affairs, and
   more especially the present happy alliance, to an issue.

   I heard it mentioned of this gentleman, that he was among those, whose
   impatience for victory led them into some kind of discontent at the
   operations of last winter. The event has, I think, fully proved those
   gentlemen wrong, and must convince them of it; but I can see no reason why
   a misgrounded opinion, produced by an overheated anxiety for success,
   should be mixed up with other matters it has no concern with. A man's
   political abilities may be exceedingly good, though at the same time he
   may differ, and even be wrong, in his notions of some military
   particulars.

   Mr. Deane says that Mr. Arthur Lee was dragged into a treaty with the
   utmost reluctance, a charge which if he cannot support, he must expect to
   answer for. I am acquainted that Mr. Lee had some objection against the
   constructions of a particular article [12th], which, I think, shows his
   judgment, and whenever they can be known will do him honor; but his
   general opinion of that valuable transaction I shall give in his own words
   from a letter in my hands.

   "France has done us substantial benefits, Great Britain substantial
   injuries. France offers to guarantee our sovereignty, and universal
   freedom of commerce. Great Britain condescends to accept our submission
   and to monopolize our commerce. France demands of us to be independent,
   Great Britain tributary. I do not conceive how there can be a mind so
   debased, or an understanding so perverted, as to balance between them.

   "The journeys I have made north and south in the public service, have
   given me opportunities of knowing the general disposition of Europe on our
   question. There never was one in which the harmony of opinion was so
   universal. From the prince to the peasant there is but one voice, one
   wish, the liberty of America and the humiliation of Great Britain."

   If Mr. Deane was industrious to spread reports to the injury of these
   gentlemen in Europe, as he has been in America, no wonder that their real
   characters have been misunderstood. The peculiar talent which Mr. Deane
   possesses of attacking persons behind their backs has so near a
   resemblance to the author of Plain Truth, who after promising his name to
   the public has declined to give it, and some other proceedings I am not
   unacquainted with, particularly an attempt to prevent my publications,
   that it looks as if one spirit of private malevolence governed the whole.

   Mr. Plain Truth has renewed the story of Dr. Berkenhout, to which I have
   but one reply to make: why did not Mr. Deane appear against him while he
   was here? He was the only person who knew anything of him, and his
   neglecting to give information, and thereby suffering a suspicious person
   to escape for want of proof, is a story very much against Mr. Deane; and
   his complaining after the man was gone corresponds with the rest of his
   conduct.

   When little circumstances are so easily dwelt upon, it is a sign not only
   of the want of great ones but of weakness and ill will. The crime against
   Mr. William Lee is, that some years ago he was elected an alderman of one
   of the wards in London, and the English calendar has yet printed him with
   the same title. Is that any fault of his? Or can he be made accountable
   for what the people of London may do? Let us distinguish between
   whiggishness and waspishness, between patriotism and peevishness,
   otherwise we shall become the laughing stock of every sensible and candid
   mind. Suppose the Londoners should take it into their heads to elect the
   President of Congress or General Washington an alderman, is that a reason
   why we should displace them? But, Mr. Lee, say they, has not resigned.
   These men have no judgment, or they would not advance such positions. Mr.
   Lee has nothing to resign. He has vacated his aldermanship by accepting an
   appointment under Congress, and can know nothing further of the matter.
   Were he to make a formal resignation it would imply his being a subject of
   Great Britain; besides which, the character of being an ambassador from
   the States of America, is so superior to that of any alderman of London,
   that I conceive Mr. Deane, or Mr. Plain Truth, or any other person, as
   doing a great injustice to the dignity of America by attempting to put the
   two in any disputable competition. Let us be honest lest we be despised,
   and generous lest we be laughed at.

   Mr. Deane in his address of the 5th of December, says, "having thus
   introduced you to your great servants, I now proceed to make you
   acquainted with some other personages, which it may be of consequence for
   you to know. I am sorry to say, that Arthur Lee, Esq., was suspected by
   some of the best friends you had abroad, and those in important characters
   and stations." To which I reply, that I firmly believe Mr. Deane will
   likewise be sorry he has said it. Mr. Deane after thus advancing a charge
   endeavors to palliate it by saying, "these suspicions, whether well or
   ill founded, were frequently urged to Dr. Franklin and myself." But Mr.
   Deane ought to have been certain that they were well founded, before he
   made such a publication, for if they are not well founded he must appear
   with great discredit, and it is now his duty to accuse Mr. Arthur Lee
   legally, and support the accusation with sufficient proofs. Characters are
   tender and valuable things; they are more than life to a man of
   sensibility, and are not to be made the sport of interest, or the
   sacrifice of incendiary malice. Mr. Lee is an absent gentleman, I believe
   too, an honest one, and my motive for publishing this is not to gratify
   any party or any person but as an act of social duty which one man owes to
   another, and which, I hope, will be done to me whenever I shall be accused
   ungenerously behind my back.

   Mr. Lee to my knowledge has far excelled Mr. Deane in the usefulness of
   his information, respecting the political and military designs of the
   Court of London. While in London he conveyed intelligence that was
   dangerous to his personal safety. Many will remember the instance of the
   rifle man who had been carried prisoner to England alone three years ago,
   and who afterwards returned from thence to America, and brought with him a
   letter concealed in a button. That letter was from this gentleman, and the
   public will, I believe, conclude, that the hazard Mr. Lee exposed himself
   to, in giving information while so situated, and by such means, deserves
   their regard and thanks. The detail of the number of the foreign and
   British troops for the campaign of 1776, came first from him, as did
   likewise the expedition against South Carolina and Canada, and among other
   accounts of his, that the English emissaries at Paris had boasted that the
   British Ministry had sent over half a million of guineas to corrupt the
   Congress. This money, should they be fools enough to send it, will be very
   ineffectually attempted or bestowed, for repeated instances have shown
   that the moment any man steps aside from the public interest of America,
   he becomes despised, and if in office, superseded.

   Mr. Deane says, "that Dr. Berkenhout, when he returned to New York,
   ventured to assure the British Commissioners, that by the alliance with
   France, America was at liberty to make peace without consulting her ally,
   unless England declared war." What is it to us what Dr. Berkenhout said,
   or how came Mr. Deane to know what passed between him and the British
   Commissioners? But I ask Mr. Deane's pardon, he has told us how.
   "Providence (says he), in whom we put our trusty unfolded it to me." But
   Mr. Deane says, that Colonel R. H. Lee, pertinaciously maintained the same
   doctrine. The treaty of alliance will neither admit of debate nor any
   equivocal explanation. Had war not broken out, or had not Great Britain,
   in resentment to that alliance or connection, and of the good
   correspondence which is the object of the said treaty, broken the peace
   with France, either by direct hostilities or by hindering her commerce and
   navigation in a manner contrary to the rights of nations, and the peace
   subsisting at that time, between the two Crowns,-in this case, I likewise
   say, that America as a matter of right, could have made a peace without
   consulting her ally, though the civil obligations of mutual esteem and
   friendship would have required such a consultation. But war has broken
   out, though not declared, for the first article in the treaty of alliance
   is confined to the breaking out of war, and not to its declaration.
   Hostilities have been commenced; therefore the first case is superseded,
   and the eighth article of the treaty of alliance has its full intentional
   force: "Article 8.-Neither of the two parties shall conclude either truce
   or peace without the formal consent of the other first obtained, and they
   mutually engage not to lay down their arms until the independence of the
   United States, shall have been formally or tacitly assured, by the treaty
   or treaties that shall terminate that war."

   What Mr. Deane means by this affected appearance of his, both personally
   and in print, I am quite at a loss to understand. He seems to conduct
   himself here in a style, that would more properly become the secretary to
   a foreign embassy, than that of an American Minister returned from his
   charge. He appears to be everybody's servant but ours, and for that reason
   can never be the proper person to execute any commission, or possess our
   confidence. Among the number of his "sufferings" I am told that he
   returned burdened with forty changes of silk, velvet, and. other dresses.
   Perhaps this was the reason he could not bring his papers.

   Mr. Deane says, that William Lee, Esq., gives five per cent commission,
   and receives a share of it for what was formerly done for two per cent.
   That matter requires to be cleared up and explained; for it is not the
   quantity per cent, but the purposes to which it is applied that makes it
   right or wrong; besides which, the whole matter, like many other of Mr.
   Deane's charges, may be groundless.

   I here take my leave of this gentleman, wishing him more discretion,
   candor and generosity.

   In the beginning of this address I informed the public, that "whatever I
   should conceive necessary to say of myself, would appear in the
   conclusion." I chose that mode of arrangement, lest by explaining my own
   situation first, the public might be induced to pay a greater regard to
   what I had to say against Mr. Deane, than was necessary they should;
   whereas it was my wish to give Mr. Deane every advantage, by letting what
   I had to advance come from me, while I laid under the disadvantage of
   having the motives of my conduct mistaken by the public. Mr. Deane and his
   adherents have apparently deserted the field they took possession of and
   seemed to triumph in. They made their appeal to you, yet have suffered me
   to accuse and expose them for almost three weeks past, without a denial or
   a reply.

   I do not blame the public for censuring me while they, though wrongfully,
   supposed I deserved it. When they see their mistake, I have no doubt, but
   they will honor me with that regard of theirs which I before enjoyed. And
   considering how much I have been misrepresented, I hope it will not now
   appear ostentatious in me, if I set forth what has been my conduct, ever
   since the first publication of the pamphlet Common Sense down to this day,
   on which, and on account of my reply to Mr. Deane, and in order to import
   the liberty of the press, and my right as a freeman, I have been obliged
   to resign my office of Secretary for foreign affairs, which I held under
   Congress. But this, in order to be complete, will be published in the
   Crisis No. 8, of which notice will be given in the papers.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, January 8, 1779.

   alluded to in my last, and against which, Arthur Lee, Esq., had some
   objections.

    

    

   To THE PUBLIC ON ROBERT MORRIS'S ADDRESS

   The appearance of an address signed Robert Morris, in Mr. Dunlap's paper
   of January 9, has occasioned me to renew the subject, by offering some
   necessary remarks on that performance.

   It is customary with writers to make apologies to the public for the
   frequency of their publications; but I beg to have it well understood,
   that any such apology from me would be an affront to them. It is their
   cause, not mine, that I am and have all this while been pleading; and as I
   ought not to suppose any unwillingness in the public to be informed of
   matters which is their interest to know, so I ought not to suppose it
   necessary in me to apologize to them for doing an act of duty and justice.

   The public will please to remember, that in Mr. Dunlap's paper of December
   21, in which the piece signed Plain Truth made its illegitimate
   appearance, there was likewise published in the same paper, a short piece
   of mine, signed Common Sense, in which, speaking of the uproar raised to
   support Mr. Deane, I used these words: "I believe the whole affair to be
   an inflammatory bubble, thrown among the public, to answer both a
   mercantile end and a private pique"; and in the paper of the 2d instant I
   have likewise said, "The uncommon fury that has been spread to support Mr.
   Deane is not altogether for his sake"; and in the same paper, speaking of
   a supposed mercantile connection between Mr. Deane and other parties, then
   unknown, I again said, "It would suit their plan exceedingly well to have
   Mr. Deane appointed ambassador to Holland, because so situated, he would
   become a convenient partner in trade, or a useful factor."

   It must, I think, appear clear to the public, that among other objects, I
   have been endeavoring, by occasional allusions, for these three weeks
   past, to force out the very evidence that Mr. Morris has produced; and
   though I could have given a larger history of circumstances than that
   gentleman has done, or had any obligation to do, yet as the ac- count
   given by him comes from a confessed private partnership between a Delegate
   in Congress and a servant of that house, in the character of a Commercial
   Agent, it is fully sufficient to all the public purposes to which I mean
   to apply it; and it being therefore needless for me to seek any farther
   proofs, I shall now proceed to offer my remarks thereon.

   Mr. Morris acknowledges to have had three private mercantile contracts
   with Mr. Deane, while himself was a Delegate. Two of those contracts, he
   says, were made while Mr. Deane acted as Commercial Agent; the other,
   therefore, must be after Mr. Deane was advanced to a Commissioner. To what
   a degree of corruption must we sink, if our Delegates and Ambassadors are
   to be admitted to carry on a private partnership in trade? Why not as well
   go halves with every Quartermaster and Commissary in the army? No wonder
   if our Congress should lose its vigor, or that the remains of public
   spirit should struggle without effect. No wonder that Mr. Deane should be
   so violently supported by Members of that house, and that myself, who have
   been laboring to fish out and prove this partnership offence so dangerous
   to the common good, should, in the interim, be made the object of daily
   abuse. I have very little doubt but that the real Mr. Plain Truth is
   another of the connection in some style or degree; and that the chain is
   more extensive than I choose to express my belief. The displacing the
   honorable Arthur and William Lee would have opened a field to a still
   greater extension, and as that had enlarged, the circle of the public
   spirit must have lessened.

   Mr. Morris says in his address, "That he does not conceive that the State
   he lives in has any right or inclination to enquire into what mercantile
   connections he has had, or now has, with Mr. Deane." Mr. Morris asserts
   this as a reply to the following, a paragraph of mine, which he has quoted
   from Mr. Dunlap's paper of December 31st viz.:

   "I wish in this place to step a moment from the floor of office, and press
   it on every State to enquire what mercantile connections any of their late
   or present Delegates have had, or now have, with Mr. Deane, and that a
   precedent might not be wanting, it is important that this State,
   Pennsylvania, should begin,"

   Mr. Morris seems to deny their having such a right; and I perfectly agree
   with him, that they have no such right, and can assume no such power, over
   Mr. Morris, Mr. Deane, or any other persons, as private gentlemen. But I
   hope Mr. Morris will allow, that no such connection ought to be formed
   between himself, while a Member of Congress, and Mr. Deane, while a
   Commercial Agent, accountable for his conduct to that Congress, of which
   Mr. Morris then sat as a Member; and that any such connection, as it may
   deeply affect the interest of the whole United States, is a proper object
   of enquiry to the state he represents or has represented; for though no
   law is in being to make it punishable, yet the tendency of it makes it
   dangerous, and the inconsistency of it renders it censurable.

   Mr. Morris says, "If Mr. Deane had any commerce that was inconsistent with
   his public station, he must answer for it." So likewise must Mr. Morris;
   and if it was censurable in Mr. Deane to carry on such a commerce while he
   was Commercial Agent, it is equally as censurable in Mr. Morris to be
   concerned in it while a Delegate. Such a connection unfits the Delegate
   for his duty in Congress, by making him a partner with the servant over
   whose conduct he sits as one of his judges; and the losses or advantages
   attending such a traffic, on the part of the Agent, tempts him to an undue
   freedom with public money and public credit.

   Is it right that Mr. Deane, a servant of Congress, should sit as a Member
   of that House, when his own conduct was before the House for judgment?
   Certainly not. But the interest of Mr. Deane has sat there in the person
   of his partner, Mr. Robert Morris, who, at the same time that he
   represented this State, represented likewise the partnership in trade.
   Only let this doctrine of Mr. Morris's take place, and the consequences
   will be fatal both to public interest and public honor. By the same right
   that one Delegate may enter into a private commercial partnership with any
   Agent, Commissioner, or Ambassador, every Delegate may do the same; and if
   only a majority of Congress should form such a company, such Agents,
   Commissioners, or Ambassadors, will always find support and protection in
   Congress, even in the abuse of their trust and office. Besides which, it
   is an infringement upon the general freedom of trade, as such persons or
   companies, by having always the public monies in their hands, and public
   credit to sport with and support them, will possess unfair advantages over
   every other private merchant and trader.

   One of those advantages is, that he or they will be enabled to carry on
   trade without employing their own money, which, laying by that means at
   interest, is more than equal to an insurance in times of peace, and a
   great abatement of it in time of war; and consequently, the public always
   pays the whole of the insurance in the one case, and a great part of it in
   the other.

   But suppose the partnership of such Delegates and Ambassadors should
   break, or meet with losses they cannot sustain, on whom then will the
   burden of bankruptcy fall?

   Mr. Morris having declared what his former mercantile connections with Mr.
   Deane have been, proceeds to say, that "Whether in consequence of his good
   opinion of Mr. Deane as a man of honor and integrity, he has been led to
   form any, and what new concerns with him since his arrival here, is a
   matter which the public are no ways interested to know."

   They certainly have no right to know, on the part of Mr. Morris, as he is
   not now a Member of Congress (having served out the full time limited by
   the Constitution of this State); neither have they any right to know, on
   the part of Mr. Deane, while he remains a private character. But if Mr.
   Deane has formed a chain of mercantile connections here, it is a very good
   reason why he should not be appointed an Ambassador to Holland, or
   elsewhere; because so situated and circumstanced, the authority of America
   would be disgraced, and her interest endangered, by his becoming a
   "partner" with, or a "factor" to, the company. And this brings me to and
   establishes the declaration I first set out with, viz., that the uproar to
   support Mr. Deane was "an inflammatory bubble thrown among the public to
   answer both a mercantile and a private pique."

   One of the objections advanced against the Hon. Arthur and William Lee
   was, that they had two brothers in Congress. I think it a very great honor
   to all those gentlemen, and an instance most rarely seen, that those same
   four brothers have, from the first beginning, been most uniform Whigs. The
   principle of not investing too many honors in any one family is a very
   good one, and ought always to have its weight; but it is barbarous and
   cruel to attempt to make a crime of that which is a credit.

   Brothers are but awkward advocates for each other, because the natural
   connection being seen and known, they speak and act under the disadvantage
   of being supposed to be prepossessed. The open relationship, therefore, is
   nothing so dangerous as a private mercantile connection between Delegates
   and Ambassadors, because such connections bias, or buy us, if you please,
   and is covered and in the dark. And the interest of the Delegate being
   thus tied by a secret unseen cord to the Agent, affords the former the
   splendid opportunity of appearing to defend the latter from principle,
   whereas it is from interest.

   The haste with which I was obliged to conclude my last piece prevented my
   taking that proper leave I wished to do. In the course of my late
   publications I have had no other object in view than to serve the public
   from being misled and made fools of by Mr. Deane's specious address of
   December 5. In the course of my late publications I have given them some
   useful information and several agreeable and interesting anecdotes; for of
   what use is my office to me if I can make no good use of it? The pains I
   have taken, and the trouble I have undergone, in this act of public duty,
   have been very considerable. I have met with much opposition from various
   quarters. Some have misunderstood me; others have misrepresented me; but
   the far greater part were those whose private interests or unwarrantable
   connections were in danger of being brought to light thereby, and I now
   leave the public to judge whether, or not, I have acted in behalf of their
   interest or against it, and with that question I take my leave.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, January 11, 1779.

   To MR. DEANE

   I discovered the mistake respecting the Mercury too late to correct it;
   but as it was a circumstance no ways interested with the matter in
   question, I omitted doing it till I could get the particulars when and
   where she arrived, and wrote to a gentleman for that information, it being
   a branch that does not belong to this office. You have corrected it for
   me, and affixed to it the name of a "falsehood." As whatever is not true
   must be false, however immaterial, therefore you have a right to give it
   that name.

   I was somewhat curious to see what use you would make of it; for if you
   picked that out from all the rest, it would show that you were very hard
   set, notwithstanding my reply has been extensive and my allegations
   numerous.

   Having thus submitted to be set right by Mr. Deane, I hope he will submit
   to be set right by me. I have never labored to prove that the supplies
   were or are a present. On the contrary, I believe we are got too fond of
   buying and selling, to receive a present for the public when there is
   nothing to be got by it ourselves. The agent's profit is to purchase, not
   to receive.

   That there was a disposition in the gentlemen of France to have made
   America a very handsome present, is what I have a justifiable authority
   for saying; and I was unwilling these gentlemen should lose the honor of
   their good intentions, by Mr. Deane's monopolizing the whole merit of
   procuring these supplies to himself. Though I am certain that no man, not
   even an enemy, will accuse me of personal covetousness, yet I have a great
   deal of what may be called public covetousness, and from that motive,
   among others, I sincerely wish Mr. Deane had never gone to France.

   Mr. Plain Truth speaks of Mr. Deane as if he had discovered a mine from
   whence he drew those stores, which nobody before knew of; whereas he
   received information of it from this city. "We make no doubt but you have
   been made acquainted with the negotiations of M. H.-, and in consequence
   thereof we conclude that you will be at no loss." In short, Sir, the
   matter was in France before you were there, and your giving out any other
   story is wandering from the fact. I can trace it myself to the 21st of
   December, 1775, and that not as some have supposed, a national or Court
   affair, but a private though extensive act of friendship.

   COMMON SENSE.

   To PHILALETHES

   The thanks of the public will, no doubt, be given to you when you shall be
   found to deserve them. But be you who you may, I have this to say to you,
   that, if you have reputation enough left to be ashamed of being detected
   in a falsehood, you will do yourself a service by assuring Common Sense
   that you will correct and amend what you have published in last Saturday's
   paper, or it will be done for you.

   Having said this much to you particularly, I shall conclude with a story,
   which, I hope, will not be found applicable to Mr. Deane's affairs, or
   those of his partners. If it should, it will explain the reason why he or
   they are so stubbornly defended.

   A man was taken up in Ireland, for robbing the Treasury, and sent for a
   Lawyer to undertake his case. The man protested his innocence, and the
   Lawyer shook his head. I hope, Sir, said the man, that you are not sorry
   because I am not guilty? No, Sir, replied the Lawyer, but I am very much
   concerned at your situation; yet, if you will attend to my advice, I can
   afford you some hope, for the case stands thus: If you have robbed the
   Treasury, you will not be hanged; but if you have not robbed it, the
   circumstances are so strong against you that you must expect to suffer.
   Sir, said the man, I have money enough to bribe the-. Oh, my dear, good
   friend, replied the Lawyer, shaking him by the hand, take care what you
   say. I understand your case exceedingly well; 'tis a very clear one, and
   you may depend upon being honorably acquitted.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, January 20.

   To THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA

   There are not throughout the United States a set of men who have rendered
   more injury to the general cause, or committed more acts of injustice
   against the whole community, than those who are known by the name of
   monopolizers;7 together with such others as have squandered away, of, as
   Col. R. H. Lee rightly expresses it, "have fingered large sums of the
   public money." That there are such men is neither to be doubted or to be
   wondered at. The numerous emissions of currency, and the few accounts that
   have been settled, are sufficient signs of the former, and the tempting
   circumstances of the times and degeneracy of moral principle make the
   latter too highly probable. One monopolizer confederates with another, and
   defaulter with defaulter, till the cause becomes a common one; yet still
   these men will talk of justice, and, while they profess abhorrence to the
   principles that govern them, they pathetically lament the evils they
   create. That private vice should thus put on the mask of public good, and
   even impudence in guilt assume the style of patriotism, are paradoxes
   which those can best explain who must practice them. On my own part I can
   safely say, and challenge any one to contradict me, that I have publicly
   served America in the worst of times, with an unshaken fortitude and
   fidelity, and that without either pay or reward, save the trifling
   pittance of seventy dollars per month, which Congress two years ago
   affixed- to the office of Secretary in the foreign department, and which I
   had too much spirit to complain of, and they too little generosity to
   consider. This, with about four or five hundred dollars more, make up all
   the expense that America has ever been put to on my account. All that I
   have written she has had from me as a gift, and I cannot now serve her
   better than in endeavoring to prevent her being imposed upon by those who
   have wronged her interest, abused her confidence, or invaded the rights of
   citizenship. The two former classes I distinguish under the names of
   Monopolizers and Defaulters, That these men, dreading the consequences of
   being exposed, should vent their venomed rage at me, is what I naturally
   expected, and is one of the marks by which they may be known.

   It was a heavy task to begin, yet it was a necessary one; and the public
   will in time feel the benefit of it and thank me for it. It has ever been
   my custom to take the bull by the horns, and bring out the great
   offenders; which, though difficult at first, saves a world of trouble in
   the end. A man who is so exceedingly civil that for the sake of quietude
   and a peaceable name will silently see the community imposed upon, or
   their rights invaded, may, in his principles, be a good man, but cannot be
   stiled a useful one, neither does he come up to the full mark of his duty;
   for silence becomes a kind of crime when it operates as a cover or an
   encouragement to the guilty.

   There is a liberty the press has in a free country, which I will sooner
   yield to the inconvenience of, than be the means of suppressing. I mean
   that of publishing under anonymous signatures. I leave the printers to be
   governed by decency in the choice of the pieces they may publish; yet I
   will ever hold that man a villain who attacks a personal reputation and
   dares not face what he writes; he proves the lie upon himself by his
   concealment, and put the printer to answer for it. He stands upon a
   footing with a murderer by midnight, and increases his villainy by
   subjecting innocent persons to be suspected of the baseness which himself
   has acted. I have yet one virtue left, which is that of acting openly,
   and, meaning ever to do so-, I leave concealment to the monopolizer, the
   defaulter, and criminal of every cast with those whom they may hire or
   engage. Public measures may be properly examined under anonymous
   signatures, but civility as well as justice demands that private
   reputation should not be stabbed in the dark. However, it is the
   murderer's walk, and those who use it are welcome to it.

   I give this as an introduction to a piece which will appear in the next
   paper. We have been sinking from one stage of public virtue to another,
   till the who]e body seems to want a re-animation, a calling back to life.
   The spirit that hath long slept has at last awakened by a false alarm. Yet
   since it is up it may be turned to an extensive advantage, and be made the
   means; of rooting out the evils that produced it. We are neither the same
   People nor the same Congress that we were two years and a half ago. The
   former waits invigorating, the latter purging. No time can be so proper
   for this work as the winter. The rest that naturally ensues from the
   operation of arms, gives us the advantage of doing it without
   inconvenience, Those who dread detection will oppose all enquiries, and
   stigmatize the proposal to secure themselves; while those who have nothing
   to fear and no other objects in pursuit than what are founded in honor,
   justice, and the common good of all, will act a contrary part.

   COMMON SENSE.

   P. S. To end all disputes relative to the supplies, I have to inform that
   when the present race of scribblers have done* I shall publish an original
   letter on that subject from a gentleman of high authority. I have shown it
   to several of the first character in this city. Mr. Deane and Mr.
   Beaumarchais, may pay to each other what compliments they please; it is
   but of little importance to the subject, and is somewhat laughable to
   those who know the whole story.

   The public will please to remember, that whether the supplies were a
   present or not, made; no part of my argument; but only that the procuring
   them in any case did not depend on Mr. Deane, to which I may say, nor yet
   on Mr. Beaumarchais.

   In one of my former pieces I said that, "I believed we are got too fond of
   buying and selling to receive a present for the public, when there is
   nothing to be got, by it ourselves, and that the Agent's profit was to
   purchase, not to receive." If Mr. Deane takes too much pains to prove them
   a purchase, he will raise a suspicion that they are not a purchase, and
   that a present from the gentleman of France has been smuggled. I shall
   make no other answer on this head till every body has done.

   C. S.

   ON PHILALETHES

   I am told that the writer or assistant writer of the piece signed
   Philalethes is believed to be a person of the name of Parke, and that he
   is subject at times to fits of craziness. This is not mentioned as a
   reproach but as an excuse for him; and being the best that can be made, I
   therefore charitably apply his disorder as a remedy to his reputation.
   What credit or benefit Mr. Deane can expect to derive from the service of
   a crazy man I am at a loss to conceive; and as I think it quite out of
   character to contend with such a person (provided the report is true) I
   shall satisfy myself with civilly pointing out an error or two, and leave
   the public to think as they please of the rest.

   In my last piece I declared that I should say nothing farther on the
   subject of the supplies till every other person had done. I shall keep to
   that declaration; but in the mean time I think it necessary that what I
   have already written should not be misunderstood or misrepresented.

   Philalethes in his last piece has twice quoted the following expressions
   of mine from a publication of the 2d instant, viz. "The supplies which he
   (Mr. Deane) so pompously plumes himself upon were promised and engaged,
   and that as a present, before he even arrived in France." That I have used
   this expression is true, but in a quite different sense to what
   Philalethes has used it in; and none but a crazy man would have quoted it
   without quoting the whole paragraph. My declaring "that the supplies were
   promised and engaged, and that as a present, before Mr. Deane went to
   France" is one thing, and my declaring that I have a letter which says so,
   is entirely another thing. Philalethes has crazily applied the declaration
   to the supplies themselves, whereas in the place where I have used it, it
   is only applied to a letter which mentions the supplies. I shall quote the
   whole paragraph, word for word, from Mr. Dunlap's paper of Jan. 2d, and
   every man must see it in the same light, and allow that I have either a
   crazy or an unjust set of men to deal with. The paragraph is-

   "If Mr. Deane or any other gentleman will procure an order from Congress
   to inspect an account in my office, or if any of Mr. Deane's friends in
   Congress will take the trouble of coming themselves, I will give him or
   them my attendance, and shew them in a hand writing which Mr. Deane is
   well acquainted with, that the supplies he so pompously plumes himself
   upon were promised and engaged, and that as a present, before Mr. Deane
   even arrived in France." Philalethes ought to be obliged to me for
   assigning his craziness as an excuse for his crime.

   Now it only remains to know whether there is such a letter or not. I again
   declare there is; but that neither the King of France, by any name or
   title whatever, nor yet the nation of France, are anywhere mentioned in
   that letter; and surely the gentlemen of that country might make, or
   offer, a present to America if they pleased, with as much propriety as the
   merchants and others of London did to the Corsicans when they were warring
   against the French; and perhaps, if we had not had a purchasing Agent,
   such a present might have come. Having brought the matter to this point, I
   shall mention as a proof of there being such a letter, that I have shown
   it to several Members of Congress, among whom I take the liberty of naming
   General Roberdeau one of the Delegates of this state; and I am confident
   that that gentleman will, in any company, and on any occasion, do me the
   justice to say that he has seen such a letter, and nothing farther is
   necessary.

   It is evident, that so far from my asserting or laboring to prove the
   supplies a present, that I did not so much as form an opinion upon that
   matter myself. My first mention of them in the paper of Jan. 2d, in these
   words: "The supplies here alluded to are those which were sent from France
   in the Amphitrite, Seine and Mercury about two years ago. They had at
   first the appearance of a present, but whether so or on credit, the
   service was nevertheless a great and friendly one." And in the paper of
   Jan. 5th I likewise said, "That as the contract had not been explained by
   any of Mr. Deane's letters, and is left in obscurity by that which he
   signed the 16th of February last, therefore the full explanation must rest
   upon other authority." This is the last expression of mine relating to the
   conditions of those supplies in any of my pieces entitled "Common Sense to
   the Public on Mr. Deane's affair," and it must be clear to every man
   whether partial or otherwise, that I even relinquished all pretensions to
   the forming any opinion of my own on that head, but left it to be decided
   by those whose business it was.

   The point I really set out to prove, respecting those supplies, is
   effectually proved, and that not only by me, but by my opponents, viz.
   That we are not obliged to Mr. Deane for them. The letters which
   themselves have published of Mr. Arthur Lee, of May 23d, June 14th, and
   21st, all of them in the year 1776, prove that the contract was began
   before Mr. Deane arrived. Even Mr. Beaumarchais's letter to Congress in
   support of Mr. Deane, proves the same, for he says, "Long before the
   arrival of Mr. Deane in France, I had formed the project of establishing a
   commercial house, sufficiently powerful and spirited to hazard the risques
   of the sea and enemy, in carrying you stores and merchandize for your
   troops, of which I learned you were in great want. I spoke of this plan to
   Mr. Arthur Lee in London," &c.

   Now taking off the honor of Mr. Deane's originally procuring those
   supplies, which he has no title to, and I ask, What were his services in
   France?

   Answer. He proposed sending over a German Prince, namely: Prince
   Ferdinand, to command the army, and consequently to supersede General
   Washington. Mr. Deane will not disown this, because it is in his own hand
   writing. Fine patriot, indeed!

   I conceive it perfectly needless to set any thing else to rights, or to do
   it only for diversion sake, and one of the best replies I could make to
   Philalethes would be to publish my pieces over again. Mr. Deane's
   instructions and authority from the Committee were as I concisely related
   them, and what Philalethes calls a "detection" is a confirmation. Mr.
   Deane in his publication of Dec. 5th, to the public, says, "After leaving
   your papers and mine in safety, I left Paris the 30th of March." Surely I
   might say so too, yet this crazy man has contradicted me. He like- wise
   tells the public that the foreign papers were all in the hands of the
   Secretary of Congress, whereas the far greater part of them were in mine,
   and I delivered them only last Saturday seven night to James Lovell,
   Esquire, member of the foreign Committee. In short, the man is most
   certainly crazy, for he does not even distinguish between Mr. Deane's
   being directed by Congress to communicate the Declaration of Independence
   to foreign courts, and his not being invested with a proper public
   character to announce it in form. A great number of his detections, as he
   calls them, are mere quibbles, of which the following is an instance.

   "Falsehood 16th. Common Sense says that Mr. Deane was directed by the
   Committee which employed him to engage four Engineers." "Detection. Mr.
   Deane," says Philalethes, "had no such instruction."

   This is quibblingly true, because Mr. Deane's instruction was to engage
   Engineers not exceeding four. I am really ashamed to be seen replying to
   such ridiculous trash, which can be thrown out for no other purpose than
   to bewilder the public, and their own sense must see it. A good cause
   would scorn such wretched support, and such crazy supporters.

   Leaving in this place poor Philalethes, I proceed to take notice of two
   real letters published in that piece, the one signed Benjamin Franklin,
   the other James Lovell.

   That from Dr. Franklin is a civil certificate in behalf of Mr. Deane while
   acting in conjunction with the Doctor as a "public minister" for the space
   of "fifteen months," commencing from the time that the Doctor and Mr.
   Arthur Lee arrived in France, till the time of Mr. Deane's recall. In that
   period of fifteen months Mr. Deane could not go wrong; because, being
   "honored with one colleague and saddled with another," he stood safely
   between the two.

   But the Doctor is perfectly silent with respect to the conduct of Mr.
   Deane during the six months prior to the Doctor's arrival, and in which
   six months Mr. Deane was Commercial Agent with Mr. Thomas Morris, and
   Political Agent into the bargain. Here the Doctor is wholly reserved;
   neither does he mention a word about Mr. Deane's procuring the supplies;
   which, as it forms so principal an object in Mr. Deane's separate agency,
   ought not to have been omitted; and therefore the omission is a negative
   evidence against Mr. Deane's importance in that transaction. In short, the
   silence of the letter on these heads makes more against Mr. Deane than the
   declarations make for him.

   Now it unfortunately happens, that the objections against Mr. Deane are
   confined to the six months prior to the Doctor's arrival, and of
   consequence the letter does not reach the complaint, but leaves him just
   as he was. Neither could the Doctor know all the circumstances of Mr.
   Deane's separate agency. Mr. Deane arrived in France in June, Doctor
   Franklin in December; very little of Mr. Deane's correspondence had
   reached America before the Doctor left it, and on the Doctor's arrival in
   France it ceased, and the separate agency with it. That something was not
   agreeable may be collected from Mr. Beaumarchais's letter to Congress, for
   though Mr. Deane had said, that the United States of America were under
   greater obligations to Mr. Beaumarchais, than to any other man in Europe,
   yet Mr. Beaumarchais says in his letter "that in the affair of the
   supplies he transacted with no other person than Mr. Deane, the other
   deputies (of which Dr. Franklin was one) scarcely showing him the most
   distant marks of civility." Strange indeed if all is true that Mr. Deane
   has told! After this Mr. Beaumarchais repays Mr. Deane with an equal
   lavishment of praise, and the echo concludes the letter. Yet of all these
   things the Doctor says not a syllable, but leaves the two gentlemen to Mr.
   Deane to "justify himself" In my first piece, "on Mr. Deane s affairs"
   December 31st I mentioned that the accounts which it was Mr. Deane's
   particular duty to settle, were those which he contracted in the time of
   his being only a Commercial Agent, which separate agency of his expired
   fifteen months before he left France. This brings it to the period on
   which Dr. Franklin is silent.

   Every day opens something new. The dispatches of October 1777, which were
   said to be stolen, are now believed by some and conjectured by others not
   to be in the hands of the enemy. Philalethes says that they contained no
   such secret as I have pretended. How does he know what secret I have
   pretended, as I have not disclosed any nor ever will? The duplicates of
   those dispatches have arrived since and have been in my hands, and I can
   say thus much that they contain a paragraph which is I think a flat
   contradiction to one-half what Mr. Deane wrote while a separate Agent; and
   if he when in conjunction with his colleagues had to sign something that
   disagreed with what he had before written, and declared since, it was
   fortunate for him that the dispatches were stolen, unfortunate that the
   duplicates arrived.

   Another circumstance is somewhat striking respecting those dispatches;
   they should have arrived in Yorktown last winter about the time that Mr.
   Beaumarchais's and Mr. Deane's contract was presented to Congress for
   payment, fortunate again that they were stolen. In short, had Mr. Deane or
   his friend who signs himself W. D. in Mr. Holts paper of the n t h instant
   half as much cause for suspicion as I have concerning the loss of those
   dispatches, they would ground therein a heavy and positive charge.

   I fully expected after Mr. Deane's return to America, that he would have
   furnished the public, at least anonymously, with the history of this
   extraordinary theft, .instead of which the whole matter has slept in
   silence.

   Mr. Lovell's letter I observe has been printed twice in Mr. Dunlap's
   paper. A curious circumstance indeed? It is a civil answer to a civil
   letter and that is the amount of it. But it says, that "Mr. Deane may
   return with renewed honor in commission to Holland." By Mr. Lovell's
   figurative manner of expression and turn of political sentiments, I should
   suppose that he thought Mr. Deane's former honors were somewhat decayed. I
   am persuaded he thinks so now, and so I believe did every member of the
   foreign Committee, as well as the Secretary.

   It requires a greater degree of dexterity than any of my opponents are
   possessed of, to conduct an argument consistently that is founded upon
   wrong or bad principles. The chief part of my accusations are drawn from
   the defence which themselves have set up. They have enabled me to convert
   their justification into a charge, and by pressing them on one part, they
   have given evidence against themselves in another.

   To prove something, for I scarcely know what about the supplies, they have
   published three letters of the Hon. A. Lee of May and June, 1776, in which
   the patriotism and ardor of that gentleman is so evidently displayed, that
   they stand as evidence against Mr. Deane's address to the public of
   December 5th, in which he accuses him of defy action; and likewise prove
   what I have before declared, viz., that the affair of the supplies was
   first communicated by Mr. Beaumarchais to Mr. A. Lee in London, about
   three years ago. And by publishing Mr. Beaumarchais's letter for the sake
   of a compliment in it to Mr. Deane, they have confirmed the same evidence,
   because that letter likewise says that "long before Mr. Deane arrived in
   France the project was formed." As to the present or the purchase I never
   undertook to give even an opinion upon. It was the priority of the plan
   only that I sought to prove, and that being now sufficiently proved. The
   puffs given out to support Mr. Deane are shown to be false. The rest I
   leave to time and chance.

   I shall conclude this paper with remarking on the shocking depravity of
   moral principle with which Mr. Deane and his partisans conduct their
   affairs. They prove nothing, but exert their whole force to blast the
   reputation of every one who stands in their way or makes a doubt of their
   designs. The heat and error produced in the public, by Mr. Deane's address
   of December 5th, must have long ago subsided, had it not been constantly
   fed from some monopolizing poisoned spring. To keep up the flame they had
   unjustly raised has been the studied business of that party. Every morning
   opened with a lie and every evening closed with another. The sun has risen
   and gone down upon their falsehoods in the multitude of which they have
   bewildered detection. Still no man appears to own them. Who will listen to
   a tale without a name, or give credit to inventions which themselves are
   ashamed to father? A report neither proved nor owned becomes a falsehood
   contradicted. If their cause is just, if their object is honorable, if
   their intentions are really for the public good, why do they hide
   themselves from the eye of the public like Adam from the face of his
   Maker? Why do they skulk under the darkness of anonymous signatures; or
   why do they rest their hopes on the ruin of another's fame?

   By cutting, mangling and curtailing they may prove treason from the law,
   and blasphemy from every page in the Bible, and if they can draw any
   comfort from serving my publications in the same manner, they have my free
   consent.

   The public have seen Mr. Deane's address of December 5th, in which he
   likewise endeavors to ruin the character of two gentlemen who are absent,
   and in order that the hitherto fair fame of those absent persons may be
   effectually destroyed, without the chance of proving their innocence or
   replying to their accusers, a most infernal friend of his (for I will call
   him such) has converted all Mr. Deane's insinuations into facts, and given
   them with the most heated language to the inhabitants of the State of New
   York in Mr. Holt's paper of January 11th; and that the public may know the
   barbarous and unjustifiable means by which Mr. Deane is kept up, I shall
   republish that letter in Mr. Dunlap's paper of Thursday next; being
   confident that every man in America who has the least spark of honor or
   honesty left will feel an abhorrence at such detestable principles and
   practices. No character can stand, however fair, no reputation can
   survive, however honorable, if men unheard and in their absence are to be
   anonymously destroyed.

   The letter has not the least reference to me. I am perhaps intentionally
   left out, that the charges it contains may be supposed to be both
   uncontradicted and undoubted, and my design in republishing it is to
   expose the black principle on which it is constructed.

   It is dated Orange County, December 31, and signed W. D. If any person in
   this city (for I dare not call him a gentleman), should find it convenient
   to remove suspicions of his being the author, I thus give him notice of
   the time of republication.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, January 25, 1779.

   To SILAS DEANE,  Esquire8

   As character, like trade, is subject to bankruptcy, so nothing sooner
   discovers its approach than a frequent necessity of borrowing. I introduce
   this remark to explain, what I conceive to be, the motive that induced Mr.
   Deane, in his address of January 26th, in the Pennsylvania Packet, to
   blend his own affairs with those of General Washington and the President
   of this State. Those who have read that address, will easily perceive that
   the allusions are too farfetched to be natural and the design too obvious
   to be effectual.

   Let Mr. Deane and his affairs stand on their own merits or fall, in
   proportion to their own defects. If he has done well, he needs no borrowed
   credit; if he has done ill, the attempt will only precipitate disgrace.
   Why should matters be involved with matter, between which there is neither
   affinity or correspondence? You may, it is true, confine them together in
   the same letter, like fluids of different weights or repulsive qualities
   in the same phial; and though by convulsing you may represent a compound,
   yet the parts having no mutual propensity to union, will separate in a
   state of rest.

   Mr. Deane in his address before mentioned, says, that he "is fully
   confident that every intrigue and cabal formed against our illustrious
   Commander in Chief will prove as ineffectual as those formed against Dr.
   Franklin." This declaration comes with an ill grace from a man who not
   only threw out a proposal, but^ impliedly recommended a German Prince,
   Prince Ferdinand, to Congress, to take on him the command of the American
   army; and Mr. Deane can best explain whether the declaration he now makes
   is to be considered as an act of pennance or consummate effrontry.

   But Prince Ferdinand is not the only one whom Mr. Deane has slyly
   intimated to Congress for a Commander in Chief, neither dares he either
   personally or in writing contradict me; he has, it is true, set
   Philalethes to do it, but he dares not do it himself; and, I would ask,
   what sort of principles must that man be governed by, who will impose on
   the ignorance of another to advance a falsehood for him?

   No belief or dependence can be placed in him, who, through the agency of
   another, will deny his own handwriting; and that I may not appear even to
   intimate a charge without a sufficient foundation, I shall furnish the
   public with an extract from Mr. Deane's letter to the Foreign Committee,
   dated Paris, December 6th, 1776.

   "I submit the thought to you, whether if you could engage a great General
   of the highest character in Europe, such, for instance, as Prince
   Ferdinand, or MB, [Marshal Broglie] or others of equal rank, to take the
   lead of your armies, whether such a step would not be politic; as it would
   give a character and credit to your military, and strike perhaps a greater
   terror into our enemies. I only suggest the thought, and leave you to
   confer with BK[Baron De Kalb] on the subject at large." S. DEANE.

   Yet the writer of this letter is the same Mr. S. Deane, who, in his
   address of Jan. 26th, in the Pennsylvania Packet, says, that "he is fully
   confident that every intrigue and cabal formed against our illustrious
   Commander in Chief will prove as ineffectual as those formed against
   Doctor Franklin."

   What Mr. Deane means by cabals formed against Dr. Franklin, I am wholly
   unacquainted with. I know of none. I have heard of none. Neither has Mr.
   Deane any right to blend himself with that gentleman any more than with
   General Washington. Mr. Deane will never be Dr. Franklin, nor Dr. Franklin
   Mr. Deane. They are constitutionally different both in principle and
   practice; and if my suspicions of Mr. Deane are true, he will, in a little
   time, be as strongly reprobated by his venerable friend9 as by either of
   the Mr. Lees or Mr. Izard. The course of this letter will explain what I
   mean without either suggestion or implication.

   Omitting in this place Mr. Deane's last address as a matter of very little
   importance, I now mean to draw his hitherto confused affairs to a closer
   investigation than I have ever yet done.

   The continental public, who can have no other object in view than to
   distinguish right from wrong, will have their minds and their ears open,
   and unfettered by prejudice or selfish interest, will form their judgment
   as matters and circumstances shall appear. Mr. Deane may interestedly in
   link himself with Members of Congress, or with persons out of it, till
   involved with them, and they with him, they mutually become the pillows
   and bolsters of each other to prevent a general discovery. With such men
   reasoning has no effect. They seek not to be right but to be triumphant;
   and the same thirst of interest that induced them to the commission of one
   crime, will provoke them to a new one, in order to insure success and
   defeat detection. There are men, in all countries, in whom both vice and
   virtue are kept subordinate by a kind of cowardice, which often forms a
   great part of that natural character stiled moderation. But this is not
   the case with Mr. Deane. His conduct since his return to America has been
   excessive. His address to the public of Dec. 5th is marked with every
   feature of extraordinary violence. His inventions to support himself have
   been numerous, and such as honesty did not require; and having thus
   relinquished all pretensions to a moderate character, he must of
   consequence be looked for in one or other of the extremes of good or bad.

   Several things however are certain in Mr. Deane. He has made a rich and
   prosperous voyage to France, and whether fairly or unfairly he has yet to
   answer for.

   He has wrote and been concerned in the writing of letters which contradict
   each other.

   He has acted a double part towards his brother Commissioners in France,
   Doctor Franklin and Arthur Lee, Esq., as appears by a comparison of his
   own letters with those of the Commissioners jointly, of which himself was
   one.

   He has given the public no information of the loss of the dispatches of
   Oct. 6 and 7, 1777, nor of any circumstances attending it, notwithstanding
   he can but know that he lies under a strong suspicion of having embezzled
   them himself or of his being privy thereto, in order to prevent a
   discovery of his double dealings, and to promote the payment of a very
   large sum of money. To all those matters I shall speak as I proceed.

   Mr. Deane first made choice of the public papers, and I have only followed
   him therein. The people sufficiently feel that something is wrong, and not
   knowing where it lies, they know not where to fix their confidence, and
   every public man undergoes a share of their suspicions. Let it therefore
   come out, be it where it will, so that men and measures being properly
   known, trust and tranquility be again restored. It has strangely happened,
   that wherever Mr. Deane has been, there has been confusion. It is so in
   France. It is so here. The Commissioners, in that country, were as much
   disjointed as the Congress in this; and such being the case, let every
   man's conduct answer for itself.

   In the Pennsylvania Packet of January 2d, I acquainted the public with the
   loss of the dispatches of October 6th and 7th, and gave such an account of
   that affair as had been related to me while at Yorktown; namely, that they
   were stolen by some British emissary in France, and carried over to the
   enemy in England. The account was far from being properly authenticated;
   however, I chose to give it, in order to see what notice Mr. Deane would
   take of it. He let it pass in silence, and I observed that I was
   immediately after attacked from all quarters at once, as if emboldened to
   it by the account I had given and appeared to believe. As their
   publications were of use to me, I thought it best to reserve my
   suspicions, excepting to a few particular friends, as well in Congress as
   out.

   In the Pennsylvania Packet of January 26, I, for the first time in public,
   informed Mr. Deane of my suspicions thereon in the following words:

   "Every day opens something new. The dispatches of October, 1777, which
   were said to be stolen, are now believed by some, and conjectured by
   others, not to be in the hands of the enemy. Philalethes (in the
   Pennsylvania Packet of January 23) says, that they contained no such
   secret as I have pretended. How does he know what secret I have pretended,
   as I have not disclosed any, or ever will? The duplicates of those
   despatches have arrived since, and have been in my hands, and I can say
   thus much, that they contain a paragraph, which is, I think, a flat
   contradiction to one-half what Mr. Deane wrote while a separate agent; and
   if he, when in conjunction with his colleagues, had to sign that which
   disagreed with what he had before written and declared since, it was
   fortunate for him that the dispatches were stolen, unfortunate that the
   duplicates arrived. In short, had Mr. Deane, or his friend W. D. in Mr.
   Holt's paper of the n t h instant (January) one-half as much cause for
   suspicion as I have, concerning the loss of those dispatches, they would
   ground thereon a heavy and positive charge."

   On the appearance of this intimation, Mr. Deane and every other of my
   opponents unanimously deserted the newspapers, and suffered it to pass
   unnoticed. I have waited three weeks to afford Mr. Deane an opportunity of
   removing the suspicions alluded to, and to furnish the public with what he
   might know on that subject. He has not done it. I shall therefore lay open
   the principal circumstances on which that intimation was founded.

   In a country so rich, extensive and populous as France, there can be no
   cause to doubt either the ability or inclination of the wealthier
   inhabitants to furnish America with a gratuitous supply of money, arms,
   and ammunition. The English had supplied the Corsicans, by a subscription
   opened for that purpose in London, and the French might as consistently do
   the same by America. I, therefore, think it unnecessary to say any thing
   farther on this point than to inform that in the spring 1776, a
   subscription was raised in France to send a present to America of two
   hundred thousand pounds sterling in money, arms, and ammunition. And all
   that the suppliers wanted to know was, through what channel it should be
   remitted. The place was fixed upon.

   Having said thus much, I think it necessary to mention, that if Congress
   choose to call upon me for my proofs, which I presume they will not do, I
   am ready to advance them. I do not publish this in contradiction to their
   resolution of January 12th, because that refers to supposed presents from
   the crown only, which is a subject I never touched upon; and though
   Congress have thought proper to introduce my name therein, and perverted
   my expressions, to give a countenance thereto, I leave it to their own
   judgment, etc., to take it out again. I believe future Congresses will
   derive no honor from that resolution. And on my own part, I conceive that
   the literary services I have hitherto rendered, and that without the least
   profit or reward, deserved from that body a different treatment, even if I
   had in this instance been wrong. But the envy of some little and
   ungenerous wits in that House will never subside.

   Soon after this offer was made, Mr. Deane was sent to France as a
   Commercial Agent under the authority of the Committee which was then
   styled "The Committee for Secret Correspondence," and since changed to
   that of "The Committee for Foreign Affairs."

   On Mr. Deane's arrival at Paris, the whole affair took a new ground, and
   he entered, according to his own account, into, what he calls, a
   commercial concern, with Mr. Beaumarchais of Paris, for the same quantity
   of supplies which had been before offered as a present, and that through
   the same person of whom Mr. Deane now says he purchased them. It may not
   be improper in this place to mention that Mr. Beaumarchais was only an
   agent on the part of the suppliers, as Mr. Deane was an agent on the part
   of the receivers.

   In December following (1776), Dr. Franklin and Arthur Lee, Esq., arrived
   likewise in Paris, under a new commission, appointing them, together with
   Silas Deane, Esq., joint Commissioners from the United States. Yet it does
   not appear that Mr. Deane made either of those gentlemen acquainted with
   the particulars of any commercial contract made between him and Mr.
   Beaumarchais, neither did he ever send a copy of any such to Congress or
   to the Committee for foreign affairs.

   In September, 1777, Mr. Francy set off from France to America, as an agent
   from Mr. Beaumarchais, to demand and settle the mode of payment for those
   supplies. Yet the departure, as well as the business of this gentleman,
   appears to have been concealed from Dr. Franklin and Mr. A. Lee, and to
   have been known only to Mr. Deane; which must certainly be thought
   inconsistent and improper, as their powers were equal, and their authority
   a joint one.10

   That Mr. Deane was privy to it, is proved by his sending a letter by Mr.
   Francy, dated Paris, Sept. 10th, 1777, recommending him as Mr.
   Beaumarchais's agent, and pressing the execution of the business which he
   came upon. And that it was unknown to Doctor Franklin and Mr. A. Lee is
   circumstantially evidenced by Mr. Francy bringing with him no dispatches
   from the Commissioners jointly, and is afterwards fully proved by their
   letter of the 16th of Feb. following in which they say,

   "We hear Mr. Beaumarchais has sent over a person to demand a large sum of
   money of you on account of arms, ammunition, &c. We think it will be best
   for you to leave that matter to be settled here (France), as there is a
   mixture of public and private which you cannot so well develope." And what
   must appear very extraordinary to the reader, is, that, notwithstanding
   Mr. Deane was privy to Mr. Francy's coming, and had even by letter
   recommended the business he came upon, yet in this joint letter of Feb.
   16, 1778, he appears to know no more of the matter than they do. I have
   gone a little out of the order of time to take in this circumstance so
   curiously explanatory of Mr, Deane's double conduct.11

   Nothing material appears to have happened from the time of Mr. Francy's
   sailing in Sept., 1777, till the 6th and 7th of Oct., 1777, following,
   when the dispatches of those dates were lost, and blank white paper sent
   to Congress in their stead.

   I must request the reader in this place to take his stand and review the
   part Mr. Deane had acted. He had negotiated a prof[f]ered present into a
   purchase; and I have quoted letters to show, that though he was privy to
   Mr. Francy's coming over for the money, he had, nevertheless, concealed it
   from his colleagues, and was consequently obliged, when acting in
   conjunction with them, to know nothing of the matter, and to concur with
   them in forming such dispatches as they might have authority to do,
   notwithstanding such dispatches might contradict, or tend to expose
   himself. He had at least the chance of the seas in his favor.

   The dispatches of Oct. 6 and 7, 1777 (as appear by the duplicates which
   have since arrived) were of this kind; and are, as far as letters can be,
   positive evidence against Mr. Deane's accounts. The one is a single letter
   from the Hon. Arthur Lee, Esq., and the other a joint letter from B.
   Franklin, S. Deane and A. Lee, of Oct. 7th. That of the 6th gives a
   circumstantial account in what manner the present was first offered, and
   the latter declares, "That for the money and military stores already given
   no remittance will ever be required." But Mr. Francy was sent off with Mr.
   Deane's single letter to demand the money; what then was to be done with
   those dispatches? Had they arrived, Congress would have had a line to go
   by-and as they did not, they had nothing but Mr. Deane's single letter,
   and pretended contract with Mr. Beaumarchais to govern them.

   I shall now relate such circumstances as I am acquainted with concerning
   the loss of those dispatches, by which the reader will see that the theft
   could only be committed by some bosom apostate.

   When the supposed dispatches were brought to Yorktown by Capt. Folger, who
   came with them from France, they consisted of a packet for Congress of
   nearly the size of a half sheet, another for Robert Morris, Esq., of about
   the same size, another for Mr. Barnaby Deane, brother to Silas Deane, of
   about the same size, a smaller one from Mr. Arthur Lee to his brother,
   Col. R. H. Lee, besides letters and some small parcels to different
   persons, private, and another packet, which I shall mention afterwards.
   The packet for Congress and that for Col. R. H. Lee had both been robbed
   of every article of their contents, and filled up with blank white paper;
   that for Mr. Morris and Mr. Barnaby Deane came safe with all their
   contents. Whoever was the thief, must know exactly what to take and what
   to leave; otherwise the packet for Mr. Morris and Mr. Barnaby Deane must
   have been equally as tempting as that to Col. Lee; or rather more so,
   because they were more bulky and promising. In short, the theft discovers
   such an intimate knowledge of the contents, that it could only be done, or
   directed to be done by some person originally concerned in the writing of
   them. None of the packets or letters that came safe contained a single
   article of intelligence, except a letter from Doctor Franklin to myself,
   dated the same day of the dispatches; in which he says, "Our affairs, so
   far as they are connected with this country, are every day more
   promising." I received this letter at Lancaster through the favor of the
   then President, Henry Laurens, Esq., and returned it again to him to be
   communicated to Congress; and this, as I have before mentioned, was the
   only article of information which Congress received from May, 1777, to
   May, 1778. Which may now be set down as another extraordinary
   circumstance.

   Among the packets was likewise a large handsome one directed to Mr.
   Hancock, who, at the time the dispatches were written, was President of
   Congress, and this would undoubtedly have been a greater inducement to a
   British emissary than that directed to Col. R. H. Lee; yet this packet,
   which was only on private business, was likewise suffered to come in
   safety. But how, I ask, should any British emissary know that it contained
   no information?

   There are two ways by which this theft might be committed, viz. either by
   changing the packets, and placing blank ones in their stead, by the
   assistance of a counterfeit seal (and why not as well counterfeit a seal
   as counterfeit Common Sense), or by opening them, and filling the cover up
   with blank paper. In the first of those cases, the person must know how to
   imitate, and in either of them he must know which to select.

   Mr. Deane, through his advocate Philalethes, in the Pennsylvania Packet of
   January 23d, says, in substance, that as neither the King of England's
   speech in November, 1777, nor yet any ministerial information to
   Parliament through the course of that session, discover any knowledge of
   any secret supposed to be contained in those dispatches, that it is,
   therefore, A PROOF THAT THEY CONTAINED NO SECRET. But, surely, Mr. Deane
   will not be hardy enough to deny the contents of the dispatches which
   himself was concerning in forming, and is now suspected of suppressing?
   This would be such a refinement upon treachery, that I know of no law
   which provides for the case. I shall, therefore, in this place, content
   myself with answering to Philalethes generally, that he himself knows
   nothing of their contents, and that the silence of the British King and
   Ministry is a circumstantial evidence, that they have not got the
   dispatches, and that they were lost for some other purpose. One thing,
   however, we are certain of, viz. that the loss of them, in any case,
   answered at that time the money purpose which Mr. Deane had in view, by
   giving an opportunity to his single letter by Mr. Francy, and the business
   that gentleman came upon, to arrive at Congress, instead of the
   dispatches.

   It is true, that the duplicates were brought over by Mr. Deane's brother,
   Mr. Simeon Deane, with the treaty of alliance; but it would have been too
   barefaced to have had them stolen out of his hands, and the treaty left
   behind. Besides which, it was reasonable to suppose that Congress had
   before that, resolved upon, and settled the mode of payment, and that
   their attention to the great object of the treaty would make them
   inattentive to duplicates of a prior date, which appears to have been the
   case.

   But it was Folger's hard fate to be confined, partly in prison, and partly
   on parole, nearly five months, on account of those dispatches; he was at
   last set at liberty, because nothing could be found against him more than
   that he appeared to be a blundering soul, and therefore a proper person to
   pitch upon to bring over blank dispatches, as his probable inattention
   might afford a wilderness to the theft committed by others.

   The public have now a clear line of circumstances before them, and though
   Mr. Deane may deny the fact, it becomes him likewise to remove the
   suspicions, which I am certain he cannot do without denying the letters I
   have quoted.

   In his address of December 5th, he set out with a falsehood, by declaring
   that the "ears of the representatives (in Congress) were shut against
   him," and though the charge was unjust, as appears by the journals, yet,
   so lost are that body to the dignity of the States they represent, that
   they not only suffered the accusation to pass unquestioned, but invited
   him, at the public expense, to their next public entertainment on the 6th
   of February. It was the disgraceful submission of Congress to Mr. Deane's
   false accusation that was the real cause why the late President, Henry
   Laurens, Esq., quitted the chair, and the same cause promoted the present
   President, Mr. Jay to it. The secrecy which Congress imposes upon
   themselves is become a cloak for their misconduct, and as I wish to see a
   Congress such as America might be proud to own, and the enemy afraid to
   trifle with, it is full time for the States to know the conduct of their
   members, that they may make that body such as they would wish it to be. An
   evil cured is better than an evil concealed and suffocated.

   I shall conclude this paper with mentioning another circumstance or two,
   in which Mr. Deane's reputation appears to be involved.

    In his address of December 5th he informed the public that, "About the
   time the news arrived in France of General Burgoyne's surrender Mr. Arthur
   Lee's Secretary went to and from London, charged with affairs which were
   secret to the other Commissioners," meaning himself and Doctor Franklin;
   and on this ground, unsupported by any kind of evidence, Mr. Deane
   endeavors to have the public believe that Mr. Lee gave information to the
   British Court of the intended Treaty.

   That Mr. Lee sent his Secretary to some sea-port towns in England is very
   true, and that he did not acquaint Mr. Deane with the reasons or the
   business is as true. Mr. Deane had been a traitor to Mr. Lee, and broke
   open and suppressed some confidential information of Mr. Lee's to Congress
   some considerable time before. I do not, in this place, mean the
   dispatches of October 6th and 7th, 1777, but another affair; and the
   original letter, which I here allude to, has likewise been in my hands
   since the time Mr. Deane broke it open.

   But it is no proof that because Mr. Deane did not know the business, that
   Dr. Franklin might not, or that others did not. Mr. Deane never gave a
   line of authentic information to Congress respecting the condition of the
   enemy's fleet, their strength, weakness or destination; or of their land
   force, or their politics. Mr. Lee has constantly done so, and been on that
   head the most industrious and best informant that America had in Europe,
   and that even before the Congress existed, of which I shall mention one
   instance, viz., by the same vessel that brought over the British King's
   instruction to Sir Francis Barnard, while Governor of Massachusetts, Mr.
   A. Lee, I say, by that same vessel sent the people of Boston the
   particulars of those instructions. Whereas Mr. Deane's letters are for the
   most part filled up with flattering compliments to himself and Mr.
   Beaumarchais.

   But taking it for granted that the enemy knew of the intended treaty, the
   question is, who informed them?

   Mr. Arthur Lee had certainly no occasion to send his Secretary over to
   England to do it, because a private hint given to Lord Stormont, who was
   at that time at Paris as a British Ambassador, would have been much safer
   and more conveniently done.

   Yet that it was known in London before it was executed in Paris, is a
   matter of which I have no doubt.

   The public, or at least some of them, may recollect a letter, that was
   published a considerable time since, from a gentleman in London to a
   relation of his in this city, in which he spoke firmly of the established
   Independence of America, and advised the attention of his relation to
   money matters; that letter was from one of the Mr. Whartons of London, and
   came accidentally to sight. I mention this as a corresponding circumstance
   to what I am now going to relate.

   I have seen, and have in my possession, an attestation of a gentleman,
   which declares that he saw at Mr. Wharton's, in London, a letter from Mr.
   Deane's secretary, and in his (the secretary's) hand-writing, dated Paris,
   January 27th, informing that the Treaty of Alliance between France and
   America would be signed the 5th or 6th of February following, which letter
   likewise recommended an attention in money matters, by which, I presume,
   is meant Stock-jobbing in the English funds. And I have seen another
   account which says that, much about the same time, Mr. Deane remitted over
   to London, 19,520 livres.

   I shall now conclude this long letter with declaring that from the
   beginning of this dispute I have had no other object in view than to bring
   truth to light, in the prosecution of which I have gone contrary to my own
   personal interest. The opposition and insults I have met with have been
   numerous, yet, from an unwillingness to sacrifice public advantage to
   private resentment, I have thought it best to take as little notice of
   them as possible. Truth, in every case, is the most reputable victory a
   man can gain. And if Mr. Deane has hitherto been the Jonas of the storm, I
   sincerely wish he may be found out, that the vessel may have relief.

   As my signature, Common-Sense, has been counterfeited either by Mr. Deane,
   or some of his adherents, in Mr. Bradford's paper of February 3d, I shall
   subscribe this with my name.12

   REPLY TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS

   A writer who signs himself An American, in the Pennsylvania Packet of last
   Saturday, has selected and thrown together a variety of circumstances from
   which no final conclusion appears to be clearly drawn. He has taken for
   granted that which is matter of doubt, and argued from it as from matter
   of fact.

   The piece is written with a show of decency and candor. But is decency and
   candor the natural or the mask character of the writer? If it be the
   former, we may conclude him sincere; if the latter, artful. It is
   necessary, at this time, that writers as well as writings should be read;
   and did I know a man who pays less regard to decency than himself, I would
   name him. The short character I have drawn is that which he affects to be
   proud of, and as I would willingly please all, where I can do it
   consistently, I have for once paid a compliment to ambition.

   As subjects for his address he has selected the three following heads:
   First, The taking of Georgia by the enemy; Secondly, The calumnies raised
   against Congress; and, Thirdly, The symptoms of discontent exhibited by
   the Executive Council of Pennsylvania. The First he admits to be true. And
   the Second and Third he endeavors to explain away.

   That an enemy, after threatening the unconditional conquest of Thirteen
   States, should at last make their attack on the weakest and remotest of
   them all is such an evidence of wasted strength and despair as needs no
   other exposure than to be told. And with this simple remark I dismiss the
   first of his heads.

   As to the calumnies against Congress, I know but of one, and that is to be
   found in Mr. Deane's address of Dec. 5th, viz., That "the ears of the
   representatives were shut against him."  But will the writer of the
   American, though a member of that House, say that he was not privy to the
   libel before it was published? And will he now desert the libeller as an
   apology for himself? Consistency has some pretensions to character; and I
   would recommend it to the American to stick to his friend, and his friend
   to him. If the one can justify his conduct to his constituents, and the
   other to the public, it will be well for both.

   Mr. Deane now wants to get off the Continent, and has applied to Congress
   for leave of absence. His retreat may be as convenient to several members
   of that House as to himself. But should a man whose public accounts are
   unsettled; who has made charges against others without offering to support
   them, and has had charges laid against him, to which he has made no reply;
   who is suspected of having carried on a clandestine trade of embezzling
   public money and suppressing the public dispatches, be at this time
   permitted to depart?

   The state of things does not admit of that sleepy quietude and unlimited
   confidence which the writer of the American now wishes to promote. And as
   it cannot be the interest of the states to be imposed upon, either by
   their delegates in Congress or their ambassadors abroad, I shall collect
   and throw into one view the substance of what has been already published
   on Mr. Deane's affairs, with the letters I have written and sent into that
   body while the matter was depending, and their conduct thereon.

   COMMON SENSE.

   March 1, 1779.

   PHILADELPHIA,

    

   To MR DEANE

   SIR,-The Committee of Congress, which have been sitting near a quarter of
   a year on your affairs, have at last brought in their report. What that
   report is, is a secret to me.

   You first made your appeal to the public on the fifth of December, and
   promised them a history of "matters important for them to know" (those are
   the words of your address) yet in a few days after, you deserted them, and
   left them to find those matters out.

   Where you left the public I took them up, and the general belief now is,
   that the matters so important for them to know are found out without your
   assistance, namely, that you negotiated a proffered present amounting to
   two hundred thousand pounds sterling into a purchase, and embezzled, or
   was privy to the embezzling, the public dispatches to promote the
   imposition; and that you may have no pretence here-after to say that you
   were slanderously suspected, without any person undertaking to prove the
   circumstances on which the suspicions were founded, I hereby give you this
   notice, before your affairs be finally determined on in Congress, that if
   you will appeal to that Honorable House in behalf of your own suffering
   character, and to clear up the suspicions you lay under from my
   publications, that I will obey any order, and meet you at the bar of that
   House, and submit to any examination from them or you on the points in
   question, provided the doors be open.

   But if this condition should be thought too much, I am contented to yield
   up something to supposed convenience, and will on my own part rest
   satisfied that the President and Council of this state, and Members of
   Assembly, if they please, be present, with such Members of any other

   state who may be on the spot.

   COMMON SENSE.

   Philadelphia, March 26, 1779.

   MARKET-STREET,

   To MR. DEANE

   Wherever your future lot may be cast, or however you may be disposed of,
   the recollection of your present affairs ought to teach you this one
   useful lesson, that honesty is the best policy.

   It is now eight weeks ago since I laid before the public a regular detail
   of circumstances, on which were grounded my suspicions of your having
   negotiated a proffered present, amounting to two hundred thousand pounds
   sterling, into a purchase, and embezzled the public dispatches to promote
   the payment of the money. The circumstances as I have related them, are
   undeniable; neither have you attempted, either before Congress or the
   public, to clear up the suspicions, and by that neglect have confirmed
   them into a charge. The examination of Capt. Folger, who was detained a
   prisoner near five months at Yorktown on account of the loss of those
   dispatches, would now throw some additional light on this affair; but
   strange as it may appear, that examination is not now to be found.

   After I had laid the circumstances before the public concerning the loss
   of the dispatches, and explained the object for which they appear to have
   been lost, I informed you, in the Pennsylvania Packet of last month, that
   if you thought yourself aggrieved by any thing I had written and
   published, that I would attend an order of Congress, and submit to any
   examination on the points in question, provided the doors were open. For
   as I have some reasons to suspect that there are Members of that House who
   are privately interested with you, the success of whose projects depends
   in a great measure on your fate, I ought not to trust myself before them
   (after what has already passed) with the doors shut.

   In answer to this it may be said, that there are others of that Honorable
   House on whose integrity and public spirit I might safely rely, without
   any other evidence; but when I recollect how much more industrious
   interest is than friendship, I am the more confirmed in the opinion, that
   I ought not to trust too much to probability. I once attended an order of
   Congress (January 6th), and was asked by the President, Mr. Jay, whether I
   was the author of the publications in the Pennsylvania Packet, entitled,
   "Common Sense to the Public on Mr. Deane's affairs"; I instantly answered,
   "Yes, I am the author of all these pieces." No other questions were asked
   me, and I was ordered to withdraw. On the next day, January 7th, I applied
   for a hearing, and on a motion being made for that purpose, it passed in
   the negative; and on the next day, January 8th, I sent in my resignation
   of the office of Secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs. Yet on
   the 16th, without any enquiry whether I was right or wrong, or hearing or
   requiring any explanation on the matter, some of Mr. Deane's party made a
   motion for dismissing me, on account of those publications, from the very
   office I had before resigned, because I was refused a hearing to explain
   and support them. The motion, as it happened, was lost; for though the
   majority for the dismission was fourteen to thirteen, yet it being a tie
   upon the States, five for-five against, and two divided, it passed in the
   negative. And as this vote explains the cast of Congress on other parts of
   Mr. Deane's affairs, I shall furnish the public with the yeas and nays.

   For the Dismission.

   Mr. Holton,

   Mr. Collins,

   Mr. Jay,

   Mr. Lewis,

   Mr. Atlee,

   Mr. Paca,

   Mr. Carmichael,

   Mr. Thomas Adams,

   Mr. Merry Smith,

   Mr. Penn,

   Mr. Hill,

   Mr. Burke,

   Mr. Drayton,

   Mr. Langworthy.

   Mr. Deane and

   Mr. G. Morris,

   were not in the house.

   Against the Dismission.

   Mr. Whipple,

   Mr. S. Adams,

   Mr. Gerry,

   Mr. Lovel,

   Mr. Ellery,

   Mr. Dyer,

   Mr. Root,

   Mr. Roberdeau,

   Mr. Searle,

   Mr. Shippen,

   Mr. M'Kean,

   Mr. F. L. Lee,

   Mr. Hutson.

   Neither were(in the house)

   Mr. Laurens,

   Mr. Henry,

   Mr. Floyd,

   Mr. Frost.

   New Jersey was absent.

   How the gentlemen who voted for the dismission without an hearing, can
   possibly reconcile such conduct to their vote on the 9th of January, which
   declares that I had no right to conclude that I was not to be heard, is to
   me, and must be to every man, and even to themselves, unaccountable; their
   conduct on the two days being as opposite in principle as right and wrong.
   But to return to Mr. Deane.

   Four months ago the popular torrent ran, not only strong, but violent in
   your favor. Force by the daily inventions of interested adherents, it rose
   with the rapidity of a bubble, and discharged itself like the breaking of
   a bank. Before the multitude had time to reflect, they were hurried away,
   and, following the impulse of the first impression, felt an unwillingness
   to resist, an awkwardness to retract.

   Whether you were then right or wrong, was of no more consequence to me
   than to any other individual in America. It was as much every man's duty
   as mine to assist you in the first, or detect you in the last; and the
   only difference was, that by knowing more of the matter, I had the less
   excuse for neglect. I had politically nothing to lose or gain distinct
   from the general interest, and would as freely have supported you, had I
   believed you to be right, as I opposed you, believing you to be wrong.

   As to whatever parties (if any) were formed for or against you, in one
   place or another, I had not the most distinct connection with, or
   knowledge of. Having at that time no quarrel with you, or you with me, or
   with any other gentleman in or out of Congress upon your account, or upon
   the account of any other Commissioner or agent, I had no interested object
   to carry, no party or personal resentment to gratify; and not being even
   hinted at in your address of December 5th, I had, on my own part, nothing
   to defend.

   Such being my situation at the time your address came out, the question
   is, What could induce me to take it up? so opposite to your plan, and
   contrary to almost every man's opinion. I stood fair with the United
   States, and had no occasion to run risks to establish or recover
   reputation. The task too was heavy, and the prospect troublesome; besides
   which, I had intentionally devoted the winter to more agreeable
   employments, and the loss of so much time on your account has thrown me
   unprofitably back in the plan I had laid out, which was that of making an
   arrangement of materials for a History of the Revolution.

   Those who have no idea of stirring hand or foot without profit or reward,
   will assign such reasons for my conduct as influence their own; and as I
   can neither prevent their opinions or change their principles, I shall
   leave them to think as they please. But if I may be allowed to declare for
   myself, my only motive was, that I doubted your integrity, and had good
   reasons to suspect you were imposing on the country; and as those reasons
   were known to no other person out of Congress than myself, therefore no
   other person could go through the undertaking.

   I had, on former occasions, I believe, rendered essential service, and
   that in the very crisis of time. And I saw in this instance, that
   exclusive of the imposition you were acting on the public, by pretending
   to give them information of plots which never existed but in your own
   wicked imagination, that the plan was to get you off Ambassador to
   Holland, where you might hope to have the fingering a loan of money, and
   to make a new appointment of Ambassadors to other Courts of men connected
   with yourself. And I leave America to judge what condition our foreign
   affairs must shortly have been in, if such a measure had succeeded, and if
   what I have stated respecting your former conduct be true, which there is
   yet no reason to disbelieve.

   But there is one circumstance which must still appear embarrassing to the
   public, and which I now mean to throw the best light upon in my power.

   In your address of December 5th, you declared that "the ears of the
   Representatives in Congress were shut against you?" yet every day's
   experience has proved that the charge was untrue. Why, then, was it made,
   or why was it submitted to?

   Any indifferent person would suppose that those against whom that charge
   was directed, would feel themselves relieved by the pains I have taken to
   detect the falsehood, for it was a falsehood, as the Journals of Congress
   of December the first will testify. But be that as it may, the falsehood
   undetected was a convenient one, because it stood as an apology to a
   publication calculated to make room for a new appointment of Commissioners
   to foreign Courts, by unjustly traducing the characters of those who were
   already appointed. And consequently those who hoped to succeed on a
   vacancy, connived at the libel, and quietly put up with their share of the
   disgrace.

   Had the pretence not been made, the publication could not have appeared
   with consistency, and would have failed in its effect; for it was
   the gratification which the public felt at being appealed to, because it
   was said, Congress had "shut their ears" that gave zeal and vehemence to
   their suspicions. But the pretence being made and believed, produced an
   effect far beyond, if not contrary to, what the contrivers expected. The
   uproar against Congress was greater than against the Commissioners; and
   while Mr. Deane's advocates in the House were hoping to be sent abroad as
   Ambassadors, the cry out of doors was a new Congress. By this overspun
   piece of craft, they undermined the ground upon which they expected to
   rise, and instead of succeeding to the end, their personal honor fell a
   sacrifice to the means. The public placed Mr. Deane at one end of the
   beam, and Congress at the other, and the idea struck so naturally that if
   what Mr. Deane said was true, it was time that Congress should be removed
   and changed. And, on the other hand, if what he said was not true, the
   support and patronage they have since given him is a dishonor to the
   dignity of the United States.

   I shall conclude this paper with remarking, that we have hitherto
   confounded two distinct things together, which ought to be kept separate;
   I mean, the sovereignty of the United States, and the delegated
   representation of that sovereignty in Congress. It may happen, and perhaps
   does now happen, that the character of the latter falls far short of the
   former; or why is it that the first is rising, and the latter sinking?

   Under obligations to no one state on the Continent more than to another,
   and not at all to any, I take my view largely over the whole, and
   convinced that their interest and happiness is one, and that that which in
   foreign affairs affects any must affect all, I have, through the course of
   this business, made no distinction of states, or ever mean to do so.

   At the period we are now arrived, nothing can hurt us but want of honesty;
   and until Mr. Deane can clear up his character, those who have so
   connivingly supported him in Congress, will find it difficult to make good
   their own. I lay myself open to the world; I neither secret my thoughts
   nor disown my publications; and if there is a man in America uninfluenced
   and independent, I think I may justly claim that character.

   COMMON SENSE.

   April 10th, 1779.

   PHILADELPHIA,

    

   To WHITEHEAD HUMPHREYS.

   In the Evening Post of last Friday, July ninth, in a piece under the
   signature of Cato, the following queries, with their answers and
   innuendoes, were put:

   "Who was an Englishman?" "Tom P___."

   "Who was a Tory?" "Tom P___ "

   "Who wrote the Crisis, and abused Howe?" "Tom P___."

   "Who was made secretary to the committee of foreign affairs?" "Tom P___"

   "Who recommended him to that office?" ". . . ."

   "Who betrayed state affairs?" "Tom P___ "

   "For whom did he betray them?" ". . . ."

   "Who has traduced the tried friends of America?" "Tom P___"

   "Who has endeavored to raise suspicions against congress?" "Tom P___"

   "Who was made a committee man?" "Tom P___"

   "Who proposed a resolution to the committee to prevent supplies from going
   to the army?" "Tom P___"

   "Who maintains Tom P___?" "Nobody knows."

   "Who is paid by the enemy?" "Nobody knows."

   "Who best deserves it?" "Tom P___."

   I do not take notice of these queries, etc., from any apprehension of
   their being credited to my injury, but to expose the meanness of the
   wretch who published them.

   As I take it for granted he meant me, and no other person, I sent to the
   printer for the name of the author, or of the person by whose authority he
   published them. Mr. Towne, the printer, came to me in about two hours
   after, and told me that "he had not liberty to give him up."

   If the author chooses to submit himself to be suspected for a lying
   incendiary scoundrel, by advancing what he dares not own, he is, for the
   present, welcome; but unless he gives up his name, or the printer for him,
   the one or the other will probably meet with treatment different to what
   they expected.

   If he alludes to my publications respecting Mr. Deane, I reply, let Mr.
   Deane answer for himself. He is on the spot, so am I. I can but consider
   myself, and I know I am considered, both by friends and enemies, as a
   principal means in rescuing this country from imposition and a dangerous
   species of monopolising; for what can be more dangerous to her commerce
   and her honor than members of Congress forming trading companies in
   partnership with their ambassadors? The state of Virginia, on discovering
   that three of their delegates were partners in this company, not only
   appointed others in their room, but have passed a law to prevent such
   practices in future; and I hope every state will, in some line or other,
   do the same. If the exposing this company was revealing a state secret, or
   if stating the loss of the dispatches, or saying that the supplies,
   represented as a debt by Mr. Deane, were offered and intended as a present
   to the states, were revealing state secrets, I confess myself the person
   who revealed them; and in so doing I have done the states justice, which I
   should not have done had I acted otherwise. But the exact state of the
   case is, that I have told the truth, and concealed the secret.

   I have lately taken up the subject of the fisheries in behalf of the right
   of America, yet this wretch, whoever he is, has thought proper to abuse me
   for it in the Evening Post. I have published one piece in Messrs. Hall and
   Seller's paper of June thirty on that subject, in answer to a piece on the
   same, signed Americanus, and I now republish it in this paper, that every
   man may judge for himself what sort of a being this unknown Cato must be.

   If men, under the hope of being concealed by a printer, are to publish
   what they dare not own, the public will for ever be held in confusion.
   British emissaries, British prisoners, and disaffected refugees, will
   embarrass every measure, and endeavor to defame every character, however
   fair, that stands in their way; and for this reason, were it for no other,
   I conceive that the name of no writer, in the present state of things,
   ought to be concealed when demanded.

   THE PHILADELPHIA COMMITTEE TO ROBERT MORRIS

   Philadelphia, Saturday, July 24, 1779.

   A town meeting being to be held on Monday next, the following letter sent
   to Robert Morris, Esq, enclosing a report, are published for the
   consideration of the people previous to the meeting.

   Philadelphia, July 21, 1779.

   SIR,-We received your favor of June 26th, enclosed in your subsequent
   letter of July 7th, and likewise saw the same published in Mr. Dunlap's
   paper of the 5th, and Mr. Bradford's paper of the 14th instant. Our reason
   for not waiting on you again is assigned by you, partly on account of your
   indisposition, and partly by the publication itself, because it was not
   appealing from a report, but prior to a report; and it was not any part of
   our intention to have published any report without first presenting you
   with the whole.

   Enclosed is the report we shall make to the town meeting on Monday next,
   and which we shall publish in the paper of Saturday; and think it our duty
   to furnish you with a copy thereof, for your perusal, animadversion, or
   explanation.

   In our conduct in this business we have strictly adhered to facts, and
   scrupulously followed candor and justice; and though the relation may in
   some parts appear unpleasant, we hope you will acquit us of exaggeration.

   We observe, both in your conversation with us and in your letter of June
   26th, and publication of the same date, that you expressed some concern
   that your name had been so disadvantageously mentioned at the last town
   meeting. It often happens that those who ought to be the first, are the
   last persons to hear circumstances respecting themselves.

   The cargo in question had created much conversation before any town
   meeting was thought of. Its remaining so long in the river without any
   proposals for sale, and a public guard being placed over it, gave rise to
   many conjectures, among the rest, and which was a very general one, that
   it was the property of Mr. Silas Deane, and detained by Congress till he
   should settle his accounts; and as your connection with Mr. Deane had been
   known from an account published by you in February last, the Idea, without
   the assistance of any thing malignant, easily extended to yourself, and
   perhaps quickened other apprehensions, when it was first given out that
   you was become a purchaser of the whole; and however unwilling Mr. Morris
   may be to acknowledge the term engrossing or monopolizing, yet as he did
   not import the cargo, and did, in partnership with Mr. Solikoff, get the
   whole into his possession, we are at a loss to find any other name, though
   the expedition with which he entered on the sale abates the rigorous sense
   generally applied to these words.

   On the part of Mr. Solikoff there is something very nearly akin to
   forestalling; for though the possessing himself of a promise of the whole
   cargo was not, as we at first apprehended, before the vessel arrived,
   it was on, or before, the day on which the cargo became legally
   merchantable, which we presume takes place as to public sale from the time
   she is entered with the Naval Officer, which was on the 25th of April.

   You mention your having entered, or intended to enter, into treaty for a
   remaining part of the cargo, which is described by you as unsuited to the
   season and country. As we have not seen the invoice, and cannot learn,
   from those who have seen it, what part thereof can properly come under
   that description, we leave it to Mr. Morris to give what satisfaction he
   may think proper, either to us or the town meeting, or by any other means
   he may choose.

   We are persuaded that enquiries of this kind are attended with niceties
   and difficulties, which would be innovations on the rights and freedom of
   trade at any other time than this; but, embarked in a cause which has been
   in a great measure supported by generously surrendering individual ease
   and advantage, we are persuaded that Mr. Morris can but approve the
   principle which the public, and we by their authority, have proceeded on,
   and to which himself on many occasions has contributed.

   As we are not authorized to condemn, so neither can we justify; and are
   persuaded that when Mr. Morris reflects on the uneasiness which such a
   mode of purchasing has occasioned, that he will take measures in future to
   prevent the same consequences; for though, as a merchant, he may be
   strictly within rules, yet when he considers the many public and honorary
   stations he has filled, and the times he lives in, he must feel himself
   somewhat out of character.

   If Mr. Morris pleases to convey anything to us in answer to this and the
   enclosed, we shall deliver it with these at the town meeting, and do every
   thing in our power to remove uneasiness and restore tranquility and public
   friendship.

   We are, sir, your obedient humble servants,

   Timothy Matlack,

   David Rittenhouse,

   Thomas Paine,

   Charles Wilson Peale,

   J. B. Smith.

    

   To THE PUBLIC13

   MR. DUNLAP,-Please to insert the following. T. P.

   Silas Deane, John Nixon, and James Wilson, Esquires, having called on
   Capt. Peale, and left with him a letter signed Silas Deane, dated the 27th
   instant, respecting intimations used by him, Capt. Peale, at the
   Coffee-house, on the morning of the 26th instant, relative to some
   pecuniary offers made to me, and Capt. Peale having shown me that letter,
   which, together with my and his answer thereto, were published in the
   Pennsylvania Packet of Thursday last, in which answer of mine I engaged to
   give the information required in this day's paper.

   On examining Mr. Deane's letter a second time, I see the request is for
   the name or names only, and not for circumstances of the affair in
   question. To give the one without the other might be made an ill use of,
   and to give both in the present situation of things, without first
   referring the matter to Congress, might, as far as I am able to foresee,
   produce considerable inconvenience.

   So far as respects the three gentlemen in question, I shall give such
   answers as ought to suffice them, and that part which may be supposed to
   belong more generally to the public, I entreat them to leave to my
   discretion. Had there been no peculiar nicety in this affair, I
   undoubtedly should for my own sake have published it before now, because
   in any light in which it may be viewed, it will add to my reputation.

   Therefore, it is sufficient on my part that I declined the offer; and
   it is sufficient to Mr. Nixon and Mr. Wilson that they were not the
   persons who made it, or, I believe, knew anything about; and on the part
   of Mr. Deane it is somewhat extraordinary that he should stir about this
   only, who has taken everything else so quietly. It is likewise more
   extraordinary that he should stir at this particular time, because I
   cannot suppose he is ignorant of a letter of mine to Congress, dated so
   long ago as the 23d of April, where I mentioned the same affair to which,
   I presume, Capt. Peale alluded; and I gave my consent that Mr. Thomson
   should show Mr. Deane that letter, upon condition that he does not
   commence a quarrel with Mr. Carmichael for dubbing him at Nantz with the
   title of a __,

   After informing Congress that an offer had been made to me, I added "that
   however polite the proposal might be, or however friendly it might be
   designed, I thought it my duty to decline it, as it was accompanied with a
   condition which had a tendency to prevent the information I had since
   given and should still give on public affairs." The offer was made both
   before and after I made my resignation on the 8th of January. It was first
   put in general terms, afterwards in particular ones; was pressed on me
   with a great deal of anxiety, and amounted to more than twice my salary in
   Congress.

   I cannot possess myself of the mind of the gentleman who proposed it, so
   as to declare what every intention of his might be, but I well know that
   the acceptance of it would at that time as effectually have prevented the
   publication I gave in Mr. Dunlap's paper of the 16th of February,
   respecting the supplies and the loss of the dispatches, as if my silence
   had been made the express condition of my acceptance.

   Having said thus much, I think it a prudent step in me to refer the affair
   first to Congress. If they please to call on me for particulars, I will
   furnish them; and I am persuaded the honest and well wishing part of the
   public will rest satisfied with this, as there are matters connected with
   it which might, either by mistake or design, be made a very ill use of.

   There is not a man in the Thirteen States, so far as his powers and
   abilities extend, that will go further or do more in supporting the cause
   of America than myself, or of any country connected with her. This every
   one knows who has any intimate acquaintance with me; and according to my
   opinion of things and principles, a man needs no pecuniary inducement to
   do that to which the two-fold powers of duty and disposition naturally
   lead him on.

   Having thus far satisfied Mr. Nixon and Mr. Wilson, I take the liberty of
   asking Mr. Wilson if he is or was not directly or indirectly a partner in
   the Foreign Commercial Company, in which Mr. Deane, with several members
   of Congress at that time, and others were concerned.

   And exclusive of all other questions to Mr. Deane, I desire him to inform
   the public for what purpose it was that he remitted over to Mr. Samuel
   Wharton of London 19,520 livres, eleven days after the Treaty of Alliance
   was signed. I presume he will not undertake to contradict the fact; if he
   does, I can prove it.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. As to Whitehead Humphreys, I give him my full arid free consent to
   publish whatever and whenever he pleases, and under any signature he likes
   best; promising on my part to make no reply thereto, if he, Whitehead
   Humphreys, will to each of his future pieces add at the bottom the
   following words, viz.:

   "This is published by the same person who inserted several libelous
   productions under the signature of 'Cato,' in Benjamin Towne's Evening
   Post of July, 1779, which were so infamously false that the author or
   carrier of them, in order to avoid the shame and scandal of being known,
   tied the Printer down to such strong obligations to conceal him, that
   nothing but a halter could extort it from him."

   PHILADELPHIA, July 30, 1779.

   To MR. DUNLAP

   On the Saturday preceding the election of a Committee for the city and
   liberties, I was under an engagement to publish, in your paper of that
   day, an answer to Mr. Deane's application to Capt. Peale, respecting some
   expressions used by the latter at the Coffee-house, on the morning of the
   last Town Meeting.

   It was unpleasant to me to find myself obliged to say less in that
   publication than was generally expected, and it was not till after I had
   made the engagement that I saw the necessity of being somewhat reserved. I
   am persuaded Mr. Deane is not so ignorant of the matter as he affects to
   be, and that he only wanted to be furnished with an opportunity to make an
   ill use of.

   I had likewise another reason, which was, that as Mr. Deane had applied
   for some information to Capt. Peale, which myself only could give him a
   proper answer upon, I intended, by not doing it in the public papers, to
   improve it into an opportunity that should bring him and me face to face,
   as well on that as on other matters; to accomplish which, and likewise to
   prevent any ill use being made of the publication above mentioned, I sent
   the following letter to Mr. Deane the next morning.

   Market-street, Sunday, August 1st, 1779.

   SIR,-If you really wanted the information you applied for to Capt. Peale,
   I shall in this letter put you in a way to procure it. You will at the
   same time please to observe that I was not at the Coffee-house when the
   conversation passed to which you allude in your letter of the 27th ult.;
   neither can I learn from any person what the precise words were, some
   representing them more and some less. I cannot make myself a judge of that
   part of the business, neither will they affect one way or other the matter
   in question. If it should turn out (as it will not) that no offer was made
   to me for any purpose whatever, your affairs will stand just as they did;
   and if the contrary should be found, and that your affairs were some way
   or other connected with that offer, they will not appear the better for
   it.

   I believe Capt. Peale's motive for mentioning it was to silence the
   groundless and illiberal reflections of those who endeavored to give out
   that I wrote for reward, when I made my publications on your affairs. In
   those publications I have done honor to the generous people of France, to
   whom we are happily allied; I have done justice to the States, and no
   injustice to you; and so far, Sir, from being paid for writing them, I
   might have been rewarded either to have let them alone, or to have
   concurred in measures that might have been pointed out to me. What those
   measures were was not mentioned.

   I had many reasons for not giving the whole in the paper of last Saturday,
   which I am persuaded every well wisher to his country, could he know and
   feel these reasons as well as I do, would honor me for. By not doing it, I
   submitted myself to a temporary inconvenience; yet had I done it without
   taking the necessary precaution to prevent misrepresentation I am well
   aware of the ill use would have been made of it.

   I ought to have expected that on the appearance of Saturday's paper you
   would have requested Congress to have enquired into the matter, and
   desired I might have been immediately called before them. Your neglect in
   so doing shows, to me at least, that you are not very anxious, and that
   your application for a name was to answer some other end than barely to
   know. A name might have served a purpose, and added to the false coloring
   which have been industriously cast on the Committee for detaining the
   flour, and enquiring into the circumstances of the exportation of that
   article, been ungenerously and illiberally played off to suit the purpose
   of an election now on hand.

   Sir, make your application to me in company with any three gentlemen who
   are or have been members of Congress, and I will meet you at any time and
   place to be agreed on, within the space of one week, in company with three
   gentlemen of the same rank, and give every particular and circumstance
   that you may require, or I can recollect, respecting the matter in
   question.

   If you choose to confine your request to three Members of Connecticut, I
   will confine mine to three who now are or have been Members for this
   State. If you choose to be more general, I shall of consequence have a
   right to be the same. I will likewise submit myself to be asked by you any
   questions respecting any of my publications, or any part of my conduct,
   and I shall likewise claim the right of asking you any questions
   respecting such parts of your conduct as my publications have animadverted
   upon; and any questions on either side which shall be deemed improper by
   the gentlemen present, shall be answered or not at the choice of the party
   to whom they shall be put.

   You will please to favor me with your answer to this some time to day, the
   sooner the more agreeable.

   I am, Sir, your obedient humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Silas Deane, Esq.

   In the evening I received the following.

   Turner's-Lane, Sunday afternoon, 1 o'clock.

   SIR,-Your letter of this day was this moment put into my hands by Col.
   Mitchel. I am engaged in company and shall not return to town until
   evening. I shall take the first convenient opportunity to give you a
   proper answer.

   I am, Sir, your humble servant,

   SILAS DEANE.

    

   Mr. Paine.

   The next morning I received the following evasive refusal of the proposal
   I had made.

   Philadelphia, August 2, 1779.

   SIR,-I was well informed, and I firmly believe, that Mr. Peale said at the
   Coffee House you had been offered a bribe not to write against me. From
   hence it would naturally be supposed that I had directly or indirectly
   been concerned in that offer. I therefore called on him for the name or
   names of the parties. As to the circumstances, they can be of no
   consequence, for I am confident that upon an investigation of the matter,
   evidence must appear to exculpate me from the charge, much more
   satisfactory to the candid and honest part of my countrymen than any thing
   it is possible for you to say.

   Mr. Peak's and Mr. Paine's intentions are alike indifferent-you engaged to
   give the information required in Saturday's paper; you have not done it.
   But you speak of some proposition made to you, and you could not possess
   yourself of the mind of the gentleman who proposed it so as to declare
   what every intention of his might be, but that you well know the
   acceptance of it would have effectually prevented your publication of the
   16th of February. From hence, this one thing at least is evidently
   apparent, that you are far from acknowledging the offer alleged by Mr.
   Peale.

   It is by no means my business to investigate the bargains you may have
   made for the use or abuse of your pen; and did I desire it, you are the
   last person to whom I should apply for the real state of facts. If you or
   any other shall affirm that I, or any person by my order, or with any
   knowledge, made you directly or indirectly any offer whatever, to purchase
   your silence with relation to me or my affairs, it will become me to
   require the name or names; but at present it is quite sufficient to assert
   the falsity of such allegations.

   Since you appear solicitous to know the reasons of my silence in regard to
   your publications, I will give you one which your own consciousness must
   convince you is quite satisfactory. As Mr. Paine cannot bring any evidence
   whatever in support of his charges, the injustice of which he must be
   himself fully convinced of, it would not only be beneath the character of
   a faithful public servant, but an insult on the public candor, to attempt
   a confutation of them. You have, it seems, left the investigation of your
   bribe to Congress. I am content. Let them investigate it, if they think
   the importance of the thing merits enquiry. In the interim, you and your
   friend Mr. Peale may at your leisure determine whether you told him a
   falsehood, or he told one to the people at the Coffee-house; or whether,
   if some person has really bribed or offered to bribe you, it not now
   incumbent on Mr. Paine to mention the name as publicly as Mr. Peale
   mentioned the thing.

   The citizens of Philadelphia may also determine whether they have not a
   right to insist on it. But as Mr. Paine's publication contains a
   sufficient disavowal of Mr. Peale's assertions, I am satisfied; and I pray
   you to believe that I am far from having so much respect either for the
   person or character of Mr. Thomas Paine, as to covet any conversation or
   intercourse with him which is not absolutely necessary.

   I am, Sir, your humble servant,

   SILAS DEANE.

   To Mr. Paine.

   I now think it full time to take my leave of Mr. Deane; neither can he,
   after declining the fair and open offer I made to him, have the least
   pretence to complain. If he be an honest man, and innocent of the things
   which he well knows I suspect him guilty of, he would have met me on the
   ground I proposed, glad of the opportunity of proving me wrong.

   Why he should affect to be satisfied, or what right he can have to
   conclude "that my publication contains a sufficient disavowal of Mr.
   Peale's assertions," I am quite at loss to find out. Mr. Peale has a much
   greater right to say that Mr. Deane admits what he asserted at the
   Coffee-house, by his declining to meet Mr. Paine on the subject.

   I believe Mr. Deane expresses himself very sincerely when he declares how
   little respect he has for me. I have resigned one salary under Congress,
   and declined the offer of two others of more value, that I might be
   perfectly at liberty to do the country justice against his impositions,
   and it is not very natural he should express himself otherwise. I
   therefore pardon the affront for the sake of the truth it contains, fully
   believing it to be the honestest expression he has used since his return
   to America.

   I am but at little loss to guess the quarter from whence the late abusive
   pieces signed Cato, and others of the same cast, really came, and the end
   they were designed to answer; but so much have the authors of them been
   mistaken, that, without the least endeavors of mine, the resentment they
   hoped to excite has fallen upon themselves; and they have, at the same
   time, added to my reputation by bringing my refusal of an advantageous
   offer into public notice, which otherwise might have rested in oblivion,
   or been very little known, it being near seven months since the affair
   happened.

   But must it not appear very extraordinary that the man who last winter
   threw a whole country into the utmost confusion under the pretence of
   serving them, should now shrink from a genteel and honorable opportunity
   of vindicating himself from the heavy suspicions that have since taken
   place against him? If he be not guilty, the offer must have been
   agreeable; and if he be, he had best take care of himself. I have by me
   copies of several letters he has wrote to Congress complaining of my
   publications; but why do not his connections in that House, if they think
   him innocent, demand an hearing for him, or why does he not demand one for
   himself, or why does he not accept that which I have offered him? I have
   waited beyond the time of a week to give him an opportunity of acceding to
   it, notwithstanding his declining it in his letter to me.

   Upon the whole, is it so light a matter to be suspected of defrauding the
   country of a very large sum of money and embezzling the public dispatches
   to conceal the delinquency, that Mr. Deane does not think it worth his
   while to vindicate himself from the suspicions? Or can he be so foolish as
   not to see the suspicion is become almost universal? The silence of that
   Congress he once so much confided in, his own silence, and the silence of
   his most intimate connections, all tend to show that something is the
   matter.

   T.P.

    

   MESSRS. DEANE, JAY, AND GERARD14

   In your paper of August 31st was published an extract of a letter from
   Paris, dated May the 21st, in which the writer, among other things, says:

   "It is long since I felt in common with every other well-wisher to the
   cause of liberty and truth, the obligations I was under to the author of
   "Common Sense," for the able and unanswerable manner in which he has
   defended those principles. The same public motives I am persuaded induced
   him to address the public against Mr. Deane and his associates. The
   countenance and support which Deane has received is a melancholy presage
   of the future. Vain, assuming, avaricious and unprincipled, he will stick
   at no crime to cover what he has committed and continue his career. The
   impunity with which Deane has traduced and calumniated Congress to their
   face, the indulgence and even countenance he has received, the acrimonious
   and uncandid spirit of a letter containing Mr. Paine's publications which
   accompanied a resolve sent to Mr. Gerard, are matters of deep concern here
   to every friend to America."

   By way of explaining the particular letter referred to in the above, the
   following note was added:

   "The letter here alluded to can be no other than that signed ']ohn Jay'
   dated January 13th, and published in Mr. Dunlap's paper of Jan. 16th. It
   is very extraordinary that Mr. Jay should write such a letter, because it
   contains the same illiberal reflections which Congress, as a body, had
   rejected from their resolve of January 12, as may be seen by any one who
   will peruse the proceedings of January last. Congress has since declined
   to give countenance to Mr. Jay's letter; for though he had a public
   authority for writing a letter to Mr. Gerard, he had no authority for the
   reflections he used; besides which, the letter would be perfectly
   laughable were every circumstance known which happened at that particular
   time, and would likewise show how exceedingly delicate and cautious a
   President ought to be when he means to act officially in cases he is not
   sufficiently acquainted with."

   Every person will perceive that the note which explains the letter
   referred to, is not a part of the letter from Paris, but is added by
   another person; and Mr. Jay, or any other gentleman, is welcome to know
   that the note is in my writing, and that the original letter from Paris is
   now in my possession. I had sufficient authority for the expressions used
   in the note. Mr. Jay did not lay his letter to Mr. Gerard before Congress
   previous to sending it, and therefore, though he had their order, he had
   not their approbation. They, it is true, ordered it to be published, but
   there is no vote for approving it, neither have they given it a place in
   their Journals, nor was it published in any more than one paper in this
   city (Benjamin Towne's), though there were at that time two others. Some
   time after Mr. Jay's letter appeared in the paper, I addressed another to
   Congress, complaining of the unjust liberty he had taken, and desired to
   know whether I was to consider the expressions used in his letter as
   containing their sentiments, at the same time informing them that if they
   declined to prove what he had written I should consider their silence as a
   disapprobation of it. Congress chose to be silent; and consequently, have
   left Mr. Jay to father his own expressions.

   I took no other notice of Mr. Jay's letter at the time it was published,
   being fully persuaded that when any man recollected the part I had acted,
   not only at the first but in the worst of times, he could but look on Mr.
   Jay's letter to be groundless and ungrateful, and the more so, because if
   America had had no better friends than himself to bring about
   independence, I fully believe she would never have succeeded in it, and in
   all probability been a ruined, conquered and tributary country.

   Let any man look at the position America was in at the time I first took
   up the subject, and published "Common Sense," which was but a few months
   before the Declaration of Independence; an army of thirty thousand men
   coming out against her, besides those which were already here, and she
   without either an object or a system; fighting, she scarcely knew for
   what, and which, if she could have obtained^ would have done her no good.
   She had not a day to spare in bringing about the only thing which could
   save her. A REVOLUTION, yet no one measure was taken to promote it, and
   many were used to prevent it; and had independence not been declared at
   the time it was, I cannot see any time in which it could have been
   declared, as the train of ill-successes which followed the affair of Long
   Island left no future opportunity.

   Had I been disposed to have made money, I undoubtedly had many
   opportunities for it. The single pamphlet "Common Sense," would at that
   time of day have produced a tolerable fortune, had I only taken the same
   profits from the publication which all writers had ever done, because the
   sale was the most rapid and extensive of any thing that was ever published
   in this country, or perhaps any other. Instead of which I reduced the
   price so low, that instead of getting, I yet stand thirty-nine pounds
   eleven shillings out of pocket on Mr. Bradford's books, exclusive of my
   time and trouble, and I have acted the same disinterested part by every
   publication I have made. I could have mentioned those things long ago, had
   I chosen, but I mention them now to make Mr. Jay feel his ingratitude.

   In the Pennsylvania Packet of last Tuesday some person has republished Mr.
   Jay's letter, and Mr. Gerard's answer of the 13th and 14th January last,
   and though I was patiently silent upon their first publication, I now
   think it necessary, since they are republished, to give some circumstances
   which ought to go with them.

   At the time the dispute arose, respecting Mr. Deane's affairs, I had a
   conference with Mr. Gerard at his own request, and some matters on that
   subject were freely talked over, which it is here unnecessary to mention.
   This was on the 26. of January.

   On the evening of the same day, or the next, Mr. Gerard, through the
   mediation of another gentleman, made me a very genteel and profitable
   offer. I felt at once the respect due to his friendship, and the
   difficulties which my acceptance would subject me to. My whole credit was
   staked upon going through with Deane's affairs, and could I afterwards
   have written with the pen of an angel, on any subject whatever, it would
   have had no effect, had I failed in that or declined proceeding in it. Mr.
   Deane's name was not mentioned at the time the offer was made, but from
   some conversation which passed at the time of the interview, I had
   sufficient reason to believe that some restraint had been laid on that
   subject. Besides which I have a natural inflexible objection to any thing
   which may be construed into a private pension, because a man after

   that is no longer truly free.

   My answer to the offer was precisely in these words-"Any service I can
   render to either of the countries in alliance, or to both, I ever have
   done and shall readily do, and Mr. Gerard's esteem will be the only
   recompense I shall desire." I particularly chose the word esteem because
   it admitted no misunderstanding.

   On the fifth of January I published a continuation of my remarks on Mr.
   Deane's affairs, and I have ever felt the highest respect for a nation
   which has in every stage of our affairs been our firm and invariable
   friend. I spoke of France under that general description. It is true I
   prosecuted the point against Mr. Deane, but what was Mr. Deane to France,
   or to the Minister of France?

   On the appearance of this publication Mr. Gerard presented a memorial to
   Congress respecting some expressions used therein, and on the 6th and 7th
   I requested of Congress to be admitted to explain any passages which Mr.
   Gerard had referred to; but this request not being complied with, I, on
   the 8th, sent in my resignations of the office of Secretary to the
   Committee of Foreign Affairs.

   In the evening I received an invitation to sup with a gentleman, and Mr.
   Gerard's offer was, by his own authority, again renewed with considerable
   additions of advantage. I gave the same answer as before. I was then told
   that Mr. Gerard was very ill, and desired to see me. I replied, "That as a
   matter was then depending in Congress upon a representation of Mr. Gerard
   against some parts of my publications, I thought it indelicate to wait on
   him till that was determined."

   In a few days after I received a second invitation, and likewise a third,
   to sup at the same place, in both of which the same offer and the same
   invitation were renewed and the same answers on my part were given: But
   being repeatedly pressed to make Mr. Gerard a visit, I engaged to do it
   the next morning at ten o'clock: but as I considered myself standing on a
   nice and critical ground, and lest my reputation should be after wards
   called in question, I judged it best to communicate the whole matter to an
   honorable friend before I went, which was on the 14th of January, the very
   day on which Mr. Gerard's answer to Mr. Jay's letter is dated.

   While with Mr. Gerard I avoided as much as possible every occasion that
   might give rise to the subject. Himself once or twice hinted at the
   publications and added that, "he hoped no more would be said on the
   subject," which I immediately waived by entering on the loss of the
   dispatches. I knew my own resolution respecting the offer, had
   communicated that resolution to a friend, and did not wish to give the
   least pain to Mr. Gerard, by personally refusing that, which, from him
   might be friendship, but to me would have been the ruin of my credit. At a
   convenient opportunity I rose to take my leave, on which Mr. Gerard said:
   "Mr. Paine, I have always had a great respect for you, and should be glad
   of some opportunity of showing you more solid marks of my friendship."

   I confess I felt myself hurt and exceedingly concerned that the injustice
   and indiscretion of a party in Congress should drive matters to such an
   extremity that one side or other must go to the bottom, and in its
   consequences embarrass those whom they had drawn in to support them. I am
   conscious that America had not in France a more strenuous friend than Mr.
   Gerard, and I sincerely wish he had found a way to avoid an affair which
   has been much trouble to him. As for Deane, I believe him to be a man who
   cares not whom he involves to screen himself. He has forfeited all
   reputation in this country, first by promising to give an "history of
   matters important for the people to know" and then not only failing to
   perform that promise, but neglecting to clear his own suspected
   reputation, though he is now on the spot and can any day demand a hearing
   of Congress, and call me before them for the truth of what I have
   published respecting him.

   Two days after my visit to Mr. Gerard, Mr. Jay's letter and the answer to
   it was published, and I would candidly ask any man how it is possible to
   reconcile such letters to such offers both done at one and the same time,
   and whether I had not sufficient authority to say that Mr. Jay's letter
   would be truly laughable, were all the circumstances known which happened
   at the time of his writing.

   Whoever published those letters in last Tuesday's paper, must be an idiot
   or worse. I had let them pass over without any other public notice than
   what was contained in the note of the preceding week, but the republishing
   them was putting me to defiance, and forcing me either to submit to them
   afresh, or to give the circumstances which accompanied them. Whoever will
   look back to last winter, must see I had my hands full, and that without
   any person giving the least assistance. It was first given out that I was
   paid by Congress for vindicating their reputation against Mr. Deane's
   charges, yet a majority in that House were every day pelting me for what I
   was doing. Then Mr. Gerard was unfortunately brought in, and Mr. Jay's
   letter to him and his answer were published to effect some purpose or
   other. Yet Mr. Gerard was at the same time making the warmest professions
   of friendship to me, and proposing to take me into his confidence with
   very liberal offers. In short I had but one way to get through, which was
   to keep close to the point and principle I set out upon, and that alone
   has rendered me successful. By making this my guide I have kept my ground,
   and I have yet ground to spare, for among other things I have authentic
   copies of the dispatches that were lost.

   I am certain no man set out with a warmer heart or a better disposition to
   render public service than myself, in everything which lay in my power. My
   first endeavor was to put the politics of the country right, and to show
   the advantages as well as the necessity of independence: and until this
   was done, independence never could have succeeded. America did not at that
   time understand her own situation; and though the country was then full of
   writers, no one reached the mark; neither did I abate in my service, when
   hundreds were afterwards deserting her interest and thousands afraid to
   speak, for the first number of the "Crisis" was published in the blackest
   stage of affairs, six days before the taking the Hessians at Trenton. When
   this State was distracted by parties on account of her Constitution, I
   endeavored in the most disinterested manner to bring it to a conclusion;
   and when Deane's impositions broke out, and threw the whole States into
   confusion, I readily took up the subject, for no one else understood it,
   and the country now sees that I was right. And if Mr. Jay thinks he
   derives any credit from his letter to Mr. Gerard, he will find himself
   deceived, and that the ingratitude of the composition will be his
   reproach, not mine.

   COMMON SENSE.

    

   To THE PUBLIC15

   When any necessity or occasion has pointed out the convenience of
   addressing the public, I have never made it a consideration whether the
   subject was popular or unpopular, but whether it was right or wrong; for
   that which is right will become popular, and that which is wrong, though
   by mistake it may obtain the cry of fashion of the day, will soon lose the
   power of delusion, and sink into disesteem.

   A remarkable instance of this has happened in the case of Silas Deane; and
   I mention this circumstance with the greatest ease, because the poison of
   his hypocrisy spread over the whole country, and every man, almost without
   exception, thought me wrong in opposing him. The best friends I then had,
   except Mr. Laurens, stood at a distance, and this tribute, which is due to
   his constancy, I pay to him with respect, and that the readier, because he
   is not here to hear it. If it reaches him in his imprisonment it will
   afford him an agreeable reflection.

   "As he rose like a rocket, he would fall like the stick," is a metaphor
   which I applied to Mr. Deane in the first piece which I published
   respecting him, and he has exactly fulfilled the description. The credit
   he so unjustly obtained from the public, he lost in almost as short time.
   The delusion perished as it fell, and he soon saw himself stripped of
   popular support. His more intimate acquaintances began to doubt and to
   desert him long before he left America, and at his departure he saw
   himself the object of general suspicion. When arrived in France, he
   endeavored to effect by treason what he had failed to accomplish by fraud.
   His plans, schemes, and projects, together with his expectations of being
   sent to Holland to negotiate a loan of money, had all miscarried. He then
   began traducing and accusing America of every crime which could injure her
   reputation: "That she was a ruined country; that she only meant to make a
   tool of France, to get what money she could out of her, and then to leave
   her, and accommodate with Britain." Of all which, and much more, Colonel
   Laurens and myself, when in France, informed Dr. Franklin, who had not
   before heard of it. And to complete the character of a traitor, he has by
   letters to this country since, some of which, in his own hand writing, are
   now in the possession of Congress, used every expression and argument in
   his power to injure the reputation of France, and to advise America to
   renounce her alliance, and surrender up her independence.16 Thus, in
   France he abuses America, and in his letters to America he abuses France,
   and is endeavoring to create disunion between the two countries, by the
   same arts of double dealing by which he caused dissensions among the
   commissioners in Paris, and distractions in America. But his life has been
   fraud, and his character is that of plodding, plotting, cringing,
   mercenary, capable of any disguise that suited his purpose. His final
   detection has very happily cleared up those mistakes and removed those
   uneasinesses which his unprincipled conduct occasioned. Every one now sees
   him in the same light; for towards friends or enemies he acted with the
   same deception and injustice, and his name, like that of Arnold, ought now
   to be forgotten among us. As this is the first time I have mentioned him
   since my return from France, it is my intention it shall be the last.

   COMMON SENSE.

   1. Dr. John Berkenhout was an English medical authority who was sent in
   1778 on a secret mission to America by the British Government. He was
   imprisoned in Philadelphia on suspicion of being a spy, and returned,
   after his release, to England where he was awarded a pension. In January,
   1779, Berkenhout made several efforts to negotiate with Arthur Lee, then
   in Paris, but was unsuccessful.-Editor.

   2.

   This is fully proved by the address itself which is dated November, but
   without any day of the month, and the same is likewise acknowledged by his
   blundering friend Mr. Plain Truth. His words are, "Mr. Deane, it is true,
   wrote his address" (dated November) "previous to his application to
   Congress, of the 30th of November." He certainly could not write it after,
   there being, unfortunately for him, but thirty days in that month; "but,"
   continues Mr. Plain Truth, "he was determined notwithstanding some
   forceable reasons, which the vigilant part of the public are at no loss to
   guess, not to publish it if he could be assured of an early audience with
   Congress." Mr. Deane was in a confounded hurry, sure that he could not
   submit to be detained in America till the next day, for on that very next
   day, December 1st, in consequence of his letter the Congress, ''Resolved
   to spend two hours each day, beginning at six in the evening, till the
   state of their foreign affairs should be fully ascertained." This
   naturally included all and every part of Mr. Deane's affairs, information
   and everything else, and it is impossible but he (connected as he is with
   some late and present Members of Congress) should know immediately about
   it.

   I should be glad to be informed what those "forceable reasons" are at
   which the vigilant part of the public "guess" and likewise how early Mr.
   Deane expected an audience, since the resolution of the next day appears
   to have been too late. I am suspicious that it was too soon, and that Mr.
   Deane and his connections were not prepared for such an early examination
   notwithstanding he had been here upwards of five months, and if the thing
   is to be "guessed" at last, and that by the vigilant part of the public, I
   think I have as great a right to guess as most men, and Mr. Plain Truth,
   if he pleases, may guess what I mean; but lest he should mistake I will
   tell him my guess, it is, that the whole affair is a juggle to amuse the
   people with, in order to prevent the state of foreign affairs being
   inquired into, and Mr. Deane's accounts, and those he is connected with in
   America settled as they ought to be; and were I to go on guessing, I
   should likewise guess that this is the reason why his accounts are left
   behind, though I know many people inclined to guess that he has them with
   him but has forgot them; for my part I don't choose at present to go so
   far. If any one can give a better guess than I have done I shall give mine
   up, but as the gentlemen choose to submit it to a guess, I choose
   therefore to take them upon their own terms, and put in for the honor of
   being right. It was, I think, an injudicious word for them to use,
   especially at Christmas time.-Author.

   Donne, The Correspondence of King George the Third with Lord North from
   1768 to 1783, London, 1867.-Editor.

   4. When Captain Folger arrived at Yorktown [Pa.] he delivered a packet
   which contained nothing but blank paper, that had been put under the cover
   of the dispatches which were taken out. This fraud was acted by the
   persons to whom they were first entrusted to be brought to America, and
   who afterwards absconded, having given by way of deception the blank
   packet to Captain Folger. The Congress were by this means left without any
   information of European affairs. It happened that a private letter from
   Dr. Franklin to myself, in which he wrote to me respecting my undertaking
   the history of the present revolution, and engaged to furnish me with all
   his materials towards the completion of that work, escaped the pilfering
   by not being enclosed in the packet with the dispatches. I received this
   letter at Lancaster through the favor of the President, Henry Laurens,
   Esqr., and as it was the only letter which contained any authentic
   intelligence of the general state of our affairs in France, I transmitted
   it again to him to be communicated to Congress. This likewise was the only
   intelligence which was received from France from May, 1777, to May 2d,
   1778, when the treaty arrived; wherefore, laying aside the point
   controverted by the British Commissioners as to which moved first, France
   or England, it is evident that the resolutions of Congress of April 22d,
   1778, for totally rejecting the British Bills, were grounded entirely on
   the determination of America to support her cause,-a circumstance which
   gives the highest honor to the resolutions alluded to, and at the same
   time gives such a character of her fortitude as heightens her value, when
   considered as an ally, which though it had at that time taken place, was,
   to her, perfectly unknown.-Author.

   5. There is an article in the Constitution of this State, which, were it
   at this time introduced as a Continental regulation, might be of infinite
   service; I mean a Council of censors to inspect into the expenditure of
   public money and call defaulters to an account. It is, in my opinion, one
   of the best things in the Constitution, and that which the people ought
   never to give up, and whenever they do they will deserve to be cheated. It
   has not the most favorable look that those who are hoping to succeed to
   the government of this State, by a change in the Constitution, are so
   anxious to get that article abolished. Let expenses be ever so great, only
   let them be fair and necessary, and no good citizen will grumble.

   Perhaps it may be said, Why do not the Congress do those things? To which
   I might, by another question reply, Why don't you support them when they
   attempt it? It is not quite so easy a matter to accomplish that point in
   Congress as perhaps many conceive; men will always find friends and
   connections among the body that appoints them, which will render all such
   inquiries difficult.-Author.

   6. The "Book of Sufferings" was kept by Quakers who were punished by the
   Patriots for assisting the British during the Revolutionary War.-Editor.

   7.  A few weeks before George Washington had written to Joseph Reed,
   president of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, on the subject
   of monopolizers: "It is much to be lamented that each State long ere this
   has not hunted them down as the pests of society, and the greatest Enemys
   we have to the happiness of America. I would to God that one of the most
   atrocious of each State was h u n g in Gibbets upon a gallows five times
   as high as the one prepared by Haman. No punishment in my opinion is too
   great for the Man who can build his greatness upon his Country's ruin.'*
   See Philip S. Foner, editor, George Washington: Selections from His
   Writings, N e w York, 1944, PP<< 59-60. It is quite interesting to compare
   Washington's and Paine's language on the subject.-Editor.

   8. In the Packet of January 28, 1779, Paine wrote a brief comment on a
   letter from William Duer which went: "Will any man step forward and own
   this letter? It is, I believe, needless to go to Orange County for a
   knowledge of the author. The charges in it are either true or false; if
   true, let the writer be known that he may prove them; if not true, let him
   likewise be known, lest his concealment should subject innocent persons to
   suspicion. He who will by honest and justifiable means assist in detecting
   public abuses, wherever they can be found, is a useful character; but an
   anonymous detractor is the serpent of society." The letter was signed
   "COMMON SENSE," and dated Philadelphia, January 27.-Editor.

   9. Mr. Deane in his address of December 5th carefully shelters himself
   under Doctor Franklin by the style of his "venerable friend."-Author.

   10. In the Pennsylvania Packet of Jan. 23, in a publication signed
   Philalethes, is the following Certificate, viz.: "The military and other
   stores shipped by Roderique Hortalez and Co., in consequence of the
   contract made by them with Silas Deane, Esq., Agent for the United States
   of America, were shipped on board eight vessels, &c, &c, &c. Certified at
   Philadelphia, this 13th day of January, 1779. L. de Francy, representing
   the House of Roderique Hortalez & Co." Whether this certificate was
   published with or without the consent of M. Francy is not very material.
   But as my only design is to come at the truth of things, I am necessarily
   obliged to take notice of it. And the course of the publication I now give
   will, I presume, furnish M. Francy with circumstances which he must before
   have been unacquainted with. This certificate says, "That the supplies
   were shipped by Roderique Hortalez & Co., in consequence of a contract
   made by them with Silas Deane, Esq." I know that Mr. Roderique Hortalez
   was employed, or appeared to be so, by some public spirited gentlemen in
   France to offer a present to America, and I have seen a contract for
   freightage made with Mr. Monthieu, but I know of no contract for the
   supplies themselves. If there is such a contract, Mr. Deane has concealed
   it; and why he has done so must appear as extraordinary as that he made
   it. N.B. Mr. Beaumarchais and R. Hortalez are one and the same
   person.-Author.

   11. The Committee for foreign affairs in their first letter to the
   Commissioners after Mr. Francy's arrival, say, "We think it strange that
   the Commissioners did not jointly write by Mr. Francy, considering the
   very important designs of his coming over, viz., to settle the mode of
   payment for the past cargoes, sent by Roderique Hortalez and Co., and to
   make contracts for future. It is certain, that much eclaircissment
   (Explanation) is, at this late moment, wanting."-Author.

   12. The article Paine refers to appeared in the Pennsylvania Journal,
   February 3, 1779, over Thomas Paine's customary signature "Common Sense,"
   and was addressed " To the People of America." The following day, February
   4, there appeared in the Pennsylvania Packet the following note from Paine
   himself: "For the Pennsylvania Packet. "There are instances in which a
   want of civility is want of principle; amongst those may be reckoned that
   illiberal, though not illegal, kind of forgery, which only men of trifling
   characters and capacities will be guilty of, namely that of counterfeiting
   anonymous signatures: and the writer of a piece in Mr. Bradford's paper of
   yesterday, to which is affixed the signature of 'Common Sense,' would do
   well to consider, that such disingenuous shifts show as much a want of
   genuine wit as natural honesty, and is always a sign of weakness and
   defeat. T. P."

     In another answer in the Pennsylvania Journal of February 10th, Paine
   adds to the above: ". . . The greatest part of his ironies are truths, and
   nearly all his intended truths are ironies, and his signing himself Common
   Sense, is an ironical reflection upon his own want of it. I consider the
   piece as an artifice of some of Mr. Deane's adherents, in order to throw a
   doubt, in distant places, upon the reality of my publications under that
   signature in the Pennsylvania Packet respecting Mr. Deane's character and
   conduct. . . . " - Editor.

   13. Deane revealed that Charles Wilson Peale had informed some gentlemen
   at the Coffee House that Silas Deane had offered Paine a bribe not to
   write against him. In a letter to Deane, John Nixon and James Wilson, July
   28, 1779, Paine wrote that he would "publish in next Saturday's paper the
   whole transaction respecting the offer in question." This article is his
   explanation.-Editor.

   14. Gerard, the French minister to the United States, had complained to
   Congress of Paine's disclosures. After Paine had resigned his
   secretaryship, John Jay, President of Congress, wrote Gerard a letter
   apologizing for Paine's conduct. Discretion and realistic diplomacy
   necessitated this step, even though what Paine had pointed out was
   essentially true.-Editor.

   15. This was Paine's last public statement on the Deane affair. Deane was
   now in the pay of the British government, and, in return for his reward,
   wrote several letters to prominent men in the United States in favor of
   reunion with Great Britain. After these letters had been published in the
   newspapers, Paine wrote this statement publicly branding Deane as a
   traitor. See Carl Van Doren, Secret History of the American Revolution,
   pp. 417-418.-Editor.

   16. Mr. William Marshall of this city, formerly a pilot, who had been
   taken at sea and carried to England, and got from thence to France,
   brought over letters from Mr. Deane to America, one of which was directed
   to "Robert Morris, Esq." Mr. Morris sent it unopened to Congress, and
   advised Mr. Marshall to deliver the others there, which he did. The
   letters were of the same purport with those which have been already
   published under the signature of S. Deane, to which they had frequent
   reference.-Author
