   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Citizen Representatives

   If I should not express myself with the energy I used formerly to do, you
   will attribute it to the very dangerous illness I have suffered in the
   prison of the Lux &mdash; for several days I was insensible of my own
   existence and tho I am much recovered, it is with exceeding great
   difficulty that I find power to write you this letter.
   But before I proceed further, I request the Convention to observe - that
   this is the first line that has come from me either to the Convention or
   to any of the Committees, since my imprisonment which is approaching to
   eight months - Ah, my friends, eight months loss of Liberty seems almost a
   life time to a man who has been, as I have been, the unceasing defender of
   Liberty for twenty years.

   I have now to inform the Convention of the reason of my not having written
   before. 
   
   It is a year ago that I had strong reason to believe that
   Robespierre was my inveterate Enemy, as he was the Enemy of every man of
   virtue & humanity. The address that was sent to the Convention some time
   about last Augst from Arras (the native town of Rob--) I have
   always been informed was the work of R-- and the partisans he
   had in the place. The intention of that address was to prepare the way for
   destroying me by making the people declare (tho without assigning any
   reason) that I had lost their Confidence. The address, however, failed of
   success, as it was immediately opposed by a couter address from St. Omer,
   which declared the direct contrary. But the strange power that
   Rob-, by the most consummate hypocrisy and the most hardened
   cruelties, had obtained, rendered, any attempt on my part to obtain justice
   not only useless but even dangerous, for it is the nature of Tyranny
   always to strike a deeper blow when any attempt has been made to repel a
   former one. This being my situation I submitted with patience to the
   hardness of my fate, and waited the event of brighter days &mdash; I hope they 
   are now arrived to the nation and to me.

   Citizens 
   
   When I left the united States of America in the year 1787, I promised to
   all my Friends that I would return to them the next year. But the hope of
   seeing a revolution happily established in France, that might serve as a
   model to the rest of Europe, and the earnest and disinterested desire of
   rendering every service in my power to promote it, induced me to defer my
   return to that Country, and to the society of my Friends, for more than
   seven years. This long sacrifice of private tranquillity especially after
   having gone through the fatigues and dangers of the American Revolution,
   which continued almost eight years, deserved a better fate than the long
   imprisonment I have silently suffered &mdash; But it is not the nation, but a
   faction that has done me this injustice, and it is to the national
   representation that I appeal against that injustice. 
   
   Parties and factions,
   various and numerous as they have been, I have always avoided, my heart
   was to all France, and the object to which I applied my self was
   the Constitution. The Plan which I proposed to the Committee, of which I
   was a member, is now in the hands of Barrere, and it will speak for
   it self. It is perhaps proper that I inform you of the cause assigned in the 
   order of my imprisonment. It is that *I am a Foreigner*; where as, the foreigner
   thus imprisoned was invited into France by a decree of the late national
   assembly and that in the hour of her greatest danger when invaded by
   Austrians and Prussians. He was, moreover, a citizen of the United States
   of America, an ally of France, and not a subject of any country in Europe,
   and consequently not within the intentions of any of the decrees
   concerning foreigners - But any excuse can be made to serve the purpose of
   malignity when it is in power.
   
   Citizens

   I will not intrude on your time by offering any apology for the broken and
   imperfect manner in which I have expressed myself. I request you to accept
   it with the sincerity with which it comes from my heart; and I conclude
   with wishing fraternity and prosperity to France and union and happiness
   to her Representatives.

   Citizens &mdash; I have now stated to you my situation, and I can have no doubt
   but your Justice will restore me to the Liberty of which I have been
   deprived.

   THOMAS PAINE.
