   To his Excellency George Washington  September 7, 1782

   BORDENTOWN,

   SIR:

   I have the honor of presenting you with fifty copies of my Letter to the
   Abbe Raynal, for the use of the army, and to repeat to you my
   acknowledgments for your friendship.

   I fully believe we have seen our worst days over. The spirit of the war,
   on the part of the enemy, is certainly on the decline, full as much as we
   think for. I draw this opinion not only from the present promising
   appearance of things, and the difficulties we know the British Cabinet is
   in; but I add to it the peculiar effect which certain periods of time
   have, more or less, upon all men.

   The British have accustomed themselves to think of seven years in a manner
   different to other portions of time. They acquire this partly by habit, by
   reason, by religion, and by superstition. They serve seven years
   apprenticeship-they elect their Parliament for seven years-they punish by
   seven years transportation, or the duplicate or triplicate of that
   term-they let their leases in the same manner, and they read that Jacob
   served seven years for one wife, and after that seven years for another;
   and this particular period of time, by a variety of concurrences, has
   obtained an influence in their minds.

   They have now had seven years of war, and are no further on the continent
   than when they began. The superstitious and populous parts will therefore
   conclude that // is not to be, and the rational part of them will think
   they have tried an unsuccessful and expensive project long enough, and by
   these two joining issue in the same eventful opinion, the obstinate part
   among them will be beaten out; unless, consistent with their former
   sagacity, they should get over the matter by an act of Parliament, "to
   bind TIME in all cases whatsoever," or declare him a Rebel.

   I observe the affair of Captain Asgill seems to die away: very probably it
   has been protracted on the part of Clinton and Carleton, to gain time, to
   state the case of the British Ministry, where following close on that of
   Colonel Haynes, it will create new embarrassment to them. For my own part,
   I am fully persuaded that a suspension of his fate, still holding it in
   terrorem, will operate on a greater quantity of their passions and vices,
   and restrain them more than his execution would do. However, the change of
   measures which seems now to be taking place gives somewhat of a new cast
   to former designs; and if the case, without the execution, can be so
   managed as to answer all the purposes of the latter, it will look much
   better hereafter, when the sensations that now provoke, and the
   circumstances that would justify his exit shall be forgotten or faintly
   remembered.

   Wishing your Excellency every happiness and prosperity.

   I remain your obliged and obedient humble servant

   THOMAS PAINE.
