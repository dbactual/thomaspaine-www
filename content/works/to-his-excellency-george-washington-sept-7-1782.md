   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Borden Town Sept. 7th 1782

   Sir

   I have the honor of presenting you with fifty copies of my last publication, 
   for the amusement of theAarmy &mdash; and to repeat to you my
   acknowledgments of your friendship &mdash;

   I fully believe we have seen our worst days over. The Spirit of the war,
   on the part of the enemy, is certainly on the decline full as much as we
   think so; I draw this opinion not only from the difficulties we know they are in,
   and the present promiscuous appearance of things, but from the peculiar effect which certain periods of time
   have more or less upon all men.

   The British have accustomed themselves to think of the term of seven years in a manner
   different to other periods of time. They acquire this partly by habit, by religion, by
   reason, and by superstition. They serve seven years
   apprenticeship &mdash; They elect their parliament for seven years &mdash; They punish by
   seven years transportation, or the duplicate or triplicate of that
   term &mdash; Their leases run in the same manner; and they read that Jacob
   served seven years for one wife, and seven years for another, and the same term, likewise,
   extinguished all allegations in certain cases of debt or matrimony; and thus, 
   this particular period, by a variety of concurrences has
   obtained an influence in their minds superior to that of any other number.

   They have now had seven years of war, and are not an inch farther on the Continent
   than when they began. The superstitious and populous pars will therefore
   conclude that, it is *not to be*, and the reasonable part of them will think
   they have tried an unsuccessful scheme long enough, and it is in vain to try it any longer,
   and the obstinate part of them will be beaten out, unless, consistent with their former
   sagacity, they get over the matter at once by passing a new declaratory Act *to
   bind TIME in all cases whatsoever,* or declare him a Rebel.

   I observe that the affair of Capt Asgill seems to die away &mdash; It has probably 
   been protracted on the part of Clinton and Carleton to gain time enough to
   state the matter to the Ministry, where following close on that of
   Col. Haynes it will create new embarrassments; and I strongly believe 
   that a suspension of his fate, still holding it in
   terrorem, will operate on a greater quantity of their passions and vices
   and restrain them more than his execution. &mdash; However, the change of
   measures that seem to be taking place, gives a new cast
   to former designs, and if the case without the execution can be so
   managed as to answer all the purposes of the latter, it will look infinitely
   better hereafter, when the sensations that now provoke, and the
   circumstances that would immediately justify his exit shall be forgotten or faintly
   remembered. &mdash;

   Wishing your Excellency every happiness and Prosperity.

   I remain your obliged and obt hble servt
