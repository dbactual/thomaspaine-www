Title: From the Castle in the Air
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:51 EDT 2014

   TO THE LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD

   IN the region of clouds, where the whirlwinds arise,

   My castle of fancy was built;

   The turrets reflected the blue from the skies,

   And the windows with sunbeams were gilt.

   The rainbow sometimes, in its beautiful state,

   Enamel'd the mansion around;

   And the figures that fancy in clouds can create,

   Supplied me with gardens and ground.

   I had grottoes, and fountains, and orange tree groves,

   I had all that enchantment has told;

   I had sweet shady walks, for the Gods and their Loves,

   I had mountains of coral and gold.

   But a storm that I felt not, had risen and roll'd,

   While wrapp'd in a slumber I lay;

   And when I look'd out in the morning, behold

   My Castle was carried away.

   It pass'd over rivers, and valleys, and groves,

   The world it was all in my view;

   I thought of my friends, of their fates, of their loves,

   And often, full often of YOU.

   At length it came over a beautiful scene,

   That nature in silence had made;

   The place was but small, but 'twas sweetly serene

   And checkered with sunshine and shade.

   I gazed and I envied with painful goodwill,

   And grew tired of my seat in the air;

   When all of a sudden my Castle stood still,

   As if some attraction was there.

   Like a lark from the sky it came fluttering down,

   And placed me exactly in view,

   When whom should I meet in this charming retreat,

   This corner of calmness, but YOU.

   Delighted to find you in honor and ease,

   I felt no more sorrow, nor pain;

   But the wind coming fair, I ascended the breeze,

   And went back with my Castle again.
