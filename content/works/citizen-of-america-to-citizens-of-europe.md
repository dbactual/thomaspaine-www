   The document in French Archives (Etats-Unis, vol. 38, Part II, July, 1793 – October) is dated “Philadelphia, July 28, 1793;
   18th year of Independence”. Paine’s name is penciled on the document. So context is in question, as Paine was in Paris at
   the time of writing. Paine may have received it from America, and it may have eventually been given to the government
   for printing (which would account for his name penciled on it). It does not test well for Paine at all, we would guess
   that it is Monroe:

   A CITIZEN OF AMERICA TO THE CITIZENS OF EUROPE

   UNDERSTANDING that a proposal is intended to be made at the ensuing
   meeting of the Congress of the United States of America "to send
   commissioners to Europe to confer with the 'ministers of all the neutral
   powers for the purpose of negotiating preliminaries of peace," I address
   this letter to you on that subject, and on the several matters connected
   therewith.

   In order to discuss this subject through all its circumstances, it will
   be necessary to take a review of the state of Europe, prior to the French
   Revolution. It will from thence appear, that the powers leagued against
   France are fighting to attain an object, which, were it possible to be
   attained, would be injurious to themselves.

   This is not an uncommon error in the history of wars and governments, of
   which the conduct of the English Government in the war against America is
   a striking instance. She commenced that war for the avowed purpose of
   subjugating America; and after wasting upwards of one hundred millions
   sterling, and then abandoning the object, she discovered, in the course of
   three or four years, that the prosperity of England was increased instead
   of being diminished by the independence of America. In short, every
   circumstance is pregnant with some natural effect, upon which intentions
   and opinions have no influence; and the political error lies in misjudging
   what the effect will be. England misjudged it in the American War, and the
   reasons I shall now offer will show, that she misjudges it in the present
   war. In discussing this subject, I leave out of the question everything
   respecting forms and systems of government; for as all the governments of
   Europe differ from each other, there is no reason that the Government of
   France should not differ from the rest.

   OF THE STATE OF EUROPE PRIOR TO THE FRENCH REVOLUTION

   The clamors continually raised in all the countries of Europe were, that
   the family of the Bourbons was become too powerful; that the intrigues of
   the Court of France endangered the peace of Europe. Austria saw with a
   jealous eye the connection of France with Prussia; and Prussia, in her
   turn became jealous of the connection of France with Austria; England had
   wasted millions unsuccessfully in attempting to prevent the family compact
   with Spain; Russia disliked the alliance between France and Turkey; and
   Turkey became apprehensive of the inclination of France toward an alliance
   with Russia. Sometimes the Quadruple Alliance alarmed some of the powers,
   and at other times a contrary system alarmed others, and in all those
   cases the charge was always made against the intrigues of the Bourbons.

   Admitting those matters to be true, the only thing that could have quieted
   the apprehensions of all those powers with respect to the interference of
   France, would have been her entire NEUTRALITY in Europe; but this was
   impossible to be obtained, or if obtained was impossible to be secured,
   because the genius of her government was repugnant to all such
   restrictions.

   It now happens that by entirely changing the genius of her government,
   which France has done for herself, this neutrality, which neither wars
   could accomplish nor treaties secure, arises naturally of itself and
   becomes the ground upon which the war should terminate. It is the thing
   that approaches the nearest of all others to what ought to be the
   political views of all the European powers; and there is nothing that can
   so effectually secure this neutrality as that the genius of the French
   Government should be different from the rest of Europe.

   But if their object is to restore the Bourbons and monarchy together, they
   will unavoidably restore with it all the evils of which they have
   complained; and the first question of discord will be whose ally is that
   monarchy to be?

   Will England agree to the restoration of the family compact against which
   she has been fighting and scheming ever since it existed? Will Prussia
   agree to restore the alliance between France and Austria, or will Austria
   agree to restore the former connection between France and Prussia, formed
   on purpose to oppose herself; or will Spain or Russia, or any of the
   maritime powers, agree that France and her navy should be allied to
   England ? In fine, will any of the powers agree to strengthen the hands of
   the other against itself? Yet all these cases involve themselves in the
   original question of the restoration of the Bourbons; and, on the other
   hand, all of them disappear by the neutrality of France.

   If their object is not to restore the Bourbons it must be the
   impracticable project of a partition of the country. The Bourbons will
   then be out of the question, or, more properly speaking, they will be put
   in a worse condition; for as the preservation of the Bourbons made a part
   of the first object, the extirpation of them makes a part of the second.
   Their pretended friends will then become interested in their destruction,
   because it is favorable to the purpose of partition that none of the
   nominal claimants should be left in existence.

   But however the project of a partition may at first blind the eyes of the
   Confederacy, or however each of them may hope to outwit the other in the
   progress or in the end, the embarrassments that will arise are
   insurmountable. But even were the object attainable, it would not be of
   such general advantage to the parties as the neutrality of France, which
   costs them nothing, and to obtain which they would formerly have gone to
   war.

   OF THE PRESENT STATE OF EUROPE, AND THE CONFEDERACY

   In the first place the Confederacy is not of that kind that forms itself
   originally by concert and consent. It has been forced together by chance-a
   heterogeneous mass, held only by the accident of the moment; and the
   instant that accident ceases to operate, the parties will retire to their
   former rivalships.

   I will now, independently of the impracticability of a partition project,
   trace out some of the embarrassments which will arise among the
   confederated parties; for it is contrary to the interest of a majority of
   them that such a project should succeed.

   To understand this part of the subject it is necessary, in the first
   place, to cast an eye over the map of Europe and observe the geographical
   situation of the several parts of the Confederacy; for however strongly
   the passionate politics of the moment may operate, the politics that arise
   from geographical situation are the most certain and will in all cases
   finally prevail.

   The world has been long amused with what is called the "balance of
   power." But it is not upon armies only that this balance depends. Armies
   have but a small circle of action. Their progress is slow and limited. But
   when we take maritime power into the calculation, the scale extends
   universally. It comprehends all the interests connected with commerce.

   The two great maritime powers are England and France. Destroy either of
   those and the balance of naval power is destroyed. The whole world of
   commerce that passes on the ocean would then lie at the mercy of the
   other, and the ports of any nation in Europe might be blocked up.

   The geographical situation of those two maritime powers comes next under
   consideration. Each of them occupies one entire side of the channel from
   the straits of Dover and Calais to the opening into the Atlantic. The
   commerce of all the Northern nations, from Holland to Russia, must pass
   the straits of Dover and Calais and along the channel, to arrive at the
   Atlantic.

   This being the case, the systematical politics of all the nations,
   north-ward of the straits of Dover and Calais, can be ascertained from
   their geographical situation; for it is necessary to the safety of their
   commerce that the two sides of the Channel, either in whole or in part,
   should not be in the possession either of England or France. While one
   nation possesses the whole of one side and the other nation the other
   side, the northern nations cannot help seeing that in any situation of
   things their commerce will always find protection on one side or the
   other. It may sometimes be that of England and sometimes that of France.

   Again, while the English Navy continues in its present condition it is
   necessary that another navy should exist to control the universal sway the
   former would otherwise have over the commerce of all nations. France is
   the only nation in Europe where this balance can be placed. The navies of
   the North, were they sufficiently powerful, could not be sufficiently
   operative. They are blocked up by the ice six months in the year. Spain
   lies too remote; besides which it is only for the sake of her American
   mines that she keeps up her navy.

   Applying these cases to the project of a partition of France, it will
   appear, that the project involves with it a DESTRUCTON OF THE BALANCE OF
   MARITIME POWER; because it is only by keeping France entire and
   indivisible that the balance can be kept up. This is a case that at first
   sight lies remote and almost hidden. But it interests all the maritime and
   commercial nations in Europe in as great a degree as any case that has
   ever come before them. In short, it is with war as it is with law. In law,
   the first merits of the case become lost in the multitude of arguments;
   and in war they become lost in the variety of events. New objects arise
   that take the lead of all that went before, and everything assumes a new
   aspect. This was the case in the last great confederacy in what is called
   the Succession War, and most probably will be the case in the present.

   I have now thrown together such thoughts as occurred to me on the several
   subjects connected with the confederacy against France, and interwoven
   with the interest of the neutral powers. Should a conference of the
   neutral powers take place, these observations will, at least, serve to
   generate others. The whole matter will then undergo a more extensive
   investigation than it is in my power to give; and the evils attending upon
   either of the projects, that of restoring the Bourbons, or of attempting a
   partition of France, will have the calm opportunity of being fully
   discussed.

   On the part of England, it is very extraordinary that she should have
   engaged in a former confederacy, and a long expensive war, to prevent the
   family compact, and now engage in another confederacy to preserve it. And
   on the part of the other powers, it is as inconsistent that they should
   engage in a partition project, which, could it be executed, would
   immediately destroy the balance of maritime power in Europe, and would
   probably produce a second war to remedy the political errors of the first.
