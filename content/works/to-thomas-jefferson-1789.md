   To Thomas Jefferson [1789]

   After I got home, being alone and wanting amusement, I sat down to explain
   to myself (for there is such a thing) my ideas of national and civil
   rights, and the distinction between them. I send them to you to see how
   nearly we agree.

   Suppose twenty persons, strangers to each other, to meet in a country not
   before inhabited. Each would be a Sovereign in his own natural right. His
   will would be his law, but his power, in many cases, inadequate to his
   right; and the consequence would be that each might be exposed, not only
   to each other, but to the other nineteen. It would then occur to them that
   their condition would be much improved, if a way could be devised to
   exchange that quantity of danger into so much protection; so that each
   individual should possess the strength of the whole number. As all their
   rights in the first case are natural rights, and the exercise of those
   rights supported only by their own natural individual power, they would
   begin by distinguishing between those rights they could individually
   exercise, fully and perfectly, and those they could not. Of the first kind
   are the rights of thinking, speaking, forming and giving opinions, and
   perhaps are those which can be fully exercised by the individual without
   the aid of exterior assistance; or in other words, rights of personal
   competency. Of the second kind are those of personal protection, of
   acquiring and possessing property, in the exercise of which the individual
   natural power is less than the natural right.

   Having drawn this line they agree to retain individually the first class
   of Rights, or those of personal competency; and to detach from their
   personal possession the second class, or those of defective power, and to
   accept in lieu thereof a right to the whole power produced by a
   condensation of all the parts. These I conceive to be civil rights, or
   rights of compact, and are distinguishable from natural rights because in
   the one we act wholly in our own person, in the other we agree not to do
   so, but act under the guarantee of society.

   It therefore follows that the more of those imperfect natural rights or
   rights of imperfect power we give up, and thus exchange, the more security
   we possess; and as the word liberty is often mistakenly put for security,
   Mr. Wilson has confused his argument by confounding the terms. But it does
   not follow that the more natural rights of every kind we assign the more
   security we possess, because if we resign those of the first class we may
   suffer much by the exchange; for where the right and the power are equal
   with each other in the individual, naturally, they ought to rest there.

   Mr. Wilson must have some allusion to this distinction, or his position
   would be subject to the inference you draw from it.

   I consider the individual sovereignty of the States retained under the act
   of confederation to be of the second class of right. It becomes dangerous
   because it is defective in the power necessary to support it. It answers
   the pride and purpose of a few men in each State, but the State
   collectively is injured by it.

   [THOMAS PAINE.]



   (The letter has been sometimes attributed to Thomas Jefferson because it
   was discovered among the Jefferson manuscripts. However, there is no
   question that it was written by Thomas Paine. Gilbert Chinard, the eminent
   Jeffersonian scholar, at first believed it to be written by Jefferson, and
   so stated in the first edition of his Thomas Jefferson, The Apostle of
   Americanism, but in his second edition he admitted his error. " . . . I
   still believe," he added, "that it sums up so concisely the early
   philosophy of Thomas Jefferson that it may not be out of place to
   reproduce it again."-Editor.)
