   From the original letter from the Library of Congress.

   After I got home, being alone and wanting amusement I sat down to explain
   to myself (for there is such a thing) my Ideas of national and civil
   rights and the distinction between them &mdash; I send them to you to see how
   nearly we agree &mdash;

   Suppose 20 persons, strangers to each other, to meet in a Country not
   before inhabited. Each would be a Sovereign in his own natural right. His
   will would be his Law, but his power, in many cases, inadequate to his
   right, and the consequence would be that each might be exposed, not only
   to each other, but to the other nineteen. 
   
   It would then occur to them that
   their condition would be much improved, if a way could be devised to
   exchange that quantity of danger into so much protection, so that each
   individual should possess the strength of the whole number &mdash; 
   
   As all their rights, in the first case, are natural rights, and the 
   exercise of those rights supported only by their own natural individual power, 
   they would begin by distinguishing between those rights they could 
   individually exercise fully and perfectly and those they could not. 
   
   Of the first kind are the rights of thinking, speaking, forming and giving 
   opinions, and perhaps all those which can be fully exercised by the individual 
   without the aid of exterior assistance &mdash; or in other words, rights of 
   personal competency &mdash; Of the second kind are those of personal 
   protection of acquiring and possessing property, in the exercise of which the 
   individual natural power is less than the natural right.

   Having drawn this line they agree to retain individually the first Class
   of Rights or those of personal competency; and to detach from their
   personal possession the second Class, or those of defective power and to
   accept in lieu thereof a right to the whole power produced by a
   condensation of all the parts. These I conceive to be civil rights or
   rights of Compact, and are distinguishable from Natural rights, because in
   the one we act wholly in our own person, in the other we agree not to do
   so, but act under the guarantee of Society.

   It therefore follows that the more of those imperfect natural rights, or
   rights of imperfect power we give up, and thus exchange the more security
   we possess, and as the word liberty is often mistakenly put for security
   Mr. Wilson has confused his argument by confounding the terms. 
   
   But it does
   not follow that the more natural rights of *every kind* we assign the more
   security we possess, because if we resign those of the first class we may
   suffer much by the exchange, for where the right and the power are equal
   with each other in the individual naturally they ought to rest there &mdash; 

   Mr. Wilson must have some allusion to this distinction or his position
   would be subject to the inference you drew from it.

   I consider the individual sovereignty of the States retained under the Act
   of Confederation to be of the second class of right. It becomes dangerous
   because it is defective in the power necessary to support it. It answers
   the pride and purpose of a few men in each State &mdash; but the State
   collectively is injured by it &mdash;
