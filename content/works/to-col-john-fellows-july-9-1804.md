   To Col. John Fellows  July 9, 1804

   NEW ROCHELLE,

   FELLOW CITIZEN:

   As the weather is now getting hot at New York, and the people begin to get
   out of town, you may as well come up here and help me settle my accounts
   with the man who lives on the place. You will be able to do this better
   than I shall, and in the meantime I can go on with my literary works,
   without having my mind taken off by affairs of a different kind. I have
   received a packet from Governor [George] Clinton enclosing what I wrote
   for. If you come up by the stage you will stop at the postoffice, and they
   will direct you the way to the farm. It is only a pleasant walk. I send a
   piece for the Prospect; if the plan mentioned in it is pursued, it will
   open a way to enlarge and give establishment to the deistical church; but
   of this and some other things we will talk when you come up, and the
   sooner the better.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.
