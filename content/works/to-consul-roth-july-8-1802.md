   To Consul Roth  July 8, 1802.

   PARIS,

   MY DEAR FRIEND:

   The bearer of this is a young man that wishes to go to America. He is
   willing to do anything on board a ship to lessen the expense of his
   passage. If you know any captain to whom such a person may be useful I
   will be obliged to you to speak to him about it.

   As Mr. Otte was to come to Paris in order to go to America, I wanted to
   take a passage with him, but as he stays in England to negotiate some
   arrangements of commerce, I have given up that idea. I wait now for the
   arrival of a person from England whom I want to see, after which, I shall
   bid adieu to restless and wretched Europe. I am with affectionate esteem
   to you and Mrs. Roth.

   Yours,

   THOMAS PAINE.
