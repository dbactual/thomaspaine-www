   To Jonathan Williams, Merchant  November 26, 1781

   PHILADELPHIA,

   DEAR SIR:

   Since my arrival I have received a letter from you dated Passy May 18, and
   directed to me at Brest. I intended writing to you by Mr. Baseley who is
   counsel at L'Orient but neglected it till it was too late.-Mem: I desired
   Baseley to mention to you that Mr. Butler of So. Carolina is surprised at
   Capt. Rob-n's drawing on him for money; this Mr. Butler mentioned to me,
   and as a friend I communicate it to you. I sent you Col. Laurens' draft on
   Madam Babut (I think that is her name) at Nantes for 12 L' d'ors for the
   expense of the journey but have never learned if you received it.

   Your former friend, Silas Deane, has run his last length. In France he is
   reprobating America, and in America (by letters) he is reprobating France,
   and advising her to abandon her alliance, relinquish her independence, and
   once more become subject to Britain. A number of letters, signed Silas
   Deane, have been published in the New York papers to this effect; they are
   believed, by those who formerly were his friends, to be genuine. Mr. Robt.
   Morris assured me that he had been totally deceived in Deane; but that he
   now looked upon him to be a bad man, and his reputation totally ruined.
   Gouverneur Morris hopped round upon one leg, swore they had all been
   duped, himself among the rest, complimented me on my quick sight,-and by
   God, says he, nothing carries a man through the world like honesty:-and my
   old friend Duer, "Sometimes a sloven and sometimes a Beau," says Deane is
   a damned artful rascal. However, Duer has fairly cleared himself. He
   received a letter from him a considerable time before the appearance of
   these in the New York papers-which was so contrary to what he expected to
   receive, and of such a traitorous cast, that he communicated it to Mr.
   Luzerne, the Minister.

   Lord Cornwallis with 7247 officers and men are nabbed nicely in the
   Chesapeake, which I presume you have heard already, otherwise I should
   send you the particulars. I think the enemy can hardly hold out another
   campaign. General Greene has performed wonders to the southward, and our
   affairs in all quarters have a good appearance. The French Ministry have
   hit on the right scheme, that of bringing their force and ours to act in
   conjunction against the enemy.

   The Marquis de Lafayette is on the point of setting out for France, but as
   I am now safely on this side the water again, I believe I shall post- pone
   my second journey to France a little longer. Lest Doctr. Franklin should
   not have heard of Deane I wish you would write to him, and if anything new
   transpires in the meantime and the Marquis does not set off too soon, I
   shall write by him.

   Remember me to Mr. & Mrs. Johnstone, Dr. Pierce, Mr. Watson & Ceasey and
   Mr. Wilt. Make my best wishes to Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Alexander, and all
   the good girls at St. Germain.

   I am your friend, and obedient humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. Mind, I'll write no more till I hear from you. The French fleet is
   sailed from the Chesapeake, and the British fleet from New York-and since
   writing the above, a vessel is come up the Delaware, which informs that he
   was chased by two French frigates to the southward of

   Chesapeake, which, on their coming up, acquainted him that the French
   fleet was a head in chase of a fleet which they supposed to be the
   British.

   N. B. The French fleet sailed the 4th of this month, and the British much
   about the same time-both to the southward.
