Title: The Crisis VI
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:53 EDT 2014



   Foner's introduction:

   On February 17, 1778, Lord North, prime minister of England, proposed, and
   Parliament approved, a measure granting the Americans everything but
   independence. No revenue taxes were to be levied; the coercive measures
   and the tea duty were to be repealed; full pardon was to be granted, and
   all acts of Parliament relating to the colonies adopted after February,
   1763, were to be suspended. Five commissioners were sent from England to
   America to present these terms and "to treat, consult and agree upon means
   of quieting the disorders in the colonies of North America." George
   Johnstone, a member of the commission, was forced to withdraw after it
   became known that he had attempted to bribe Joseph Reed of Pennsylvania,
   offering him "-L-10,000 sterling and any office in the colonies in his
   Majesty's gift." The peace commission was finally composed of the persons
   to whom Paine addressed his Crisis VI.

   On June 6, 1778, Congress informed the commissioners that it would only
   accept "such terms of peace as may consist with the honor of independent
   nations." As a last resort, on October 3, the commissioners issued a
   Manifesto and Proclamation over the head of Congress to the American
   people. They called upon the people to rise up against Congress and accept
   the termsoffered by Parliament. They told all soldiers in the American
   armies that they might either return to peaceful pursuits or, "if the
   honours of a military life are become their object," fight for the king in
   the battles of the "United British Empire against our late mutual and
   natural enemy" [France]. ". . . It is both our wish and duty," the
   commissioners asserted bluntly, "to encourage and support any men or
   bodies of men in their return of loyalty to our sovereign and of affection
   to our fellow-subjects."

   To overcome any influence this Manifesto and Proclamation might exert
   among the soldiers and civilians, Paine wrote his sixth Crisis. This
   pamphlet explains in large part why the commissioners' Proclamation "ran
   against a wall of American unity as hard as Congress." (Carl Van Doren,
   Secret History of the American Revolution [New York, 1941], p. 114.) On
   November 27, 1778, the commissioners sailed from America bringing home to
   England the news that their mission had failed and that the Americans were
   determined to fight until independence was achieved.

   TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE, GENERAL CLINTON, AND
   WILLIAM EDEN, ESQ., BRITISH COMMISSIONERS
   AT NEW YORK

   THERE is a dignity in the warm passions of a Whig, which is never to be
   found in the cold malice of a Tory. In the one nature is only heated- in
   the other she is poisoned. The instant the former has it in his power to
   punish, he feels a disposition to forgive; but the canine venom of the
   latter knows no relief but revenge. This general distinction will, I
   believe, apply in all cases, and suits as well the meridian of England as
   America.

   As I presume your last proclamation will undergo the strictures of other
   pens, I shall confine my remarks to only a few parts thereof. All that you
   have said might have been comprised in half the compass. It is tedious and
   unmeaning, and only a repetition of your former follies, with here and
   there an offensive aggravation. Your cargo of pardons will have no market.
   It is unfashionable to look at them- even speculation is at an end. They
   have become a perfect drug, and no way calculated for the climate.

   In the course of your proclamation you say, "The policy as well as the
   benevolence of Great Britain have thus far checked the extremes of war,
   when they tended to distress a people still considered as their fellow
   subjects, and to desolate a country shortly to become again a source of
   mutual advantage." What you mean by "the benevolence of Great Britain" is
   to me inconceivable. To put a plain question; do you consider yourselves
   men or devils? For until this point is settled, no determinate sense can
   be put upon the expression. You have already equalled and in many cases
   excelled, the savages of either Indies; and if you have yet a cruelty in
   store you must have imported it, unmixed with every human material, from
   the original warehouse of hell.

   To the interposition of Providence, and her blessings on our endeavors,
   and not to British benevolence are we indebted for the short chain that
   limits your ravages. Remember you do not, at this time, command a foot of
   land on the continent of America. Staten Island, York Island, a small part
   of Long Island, and Rhode Island, circumscribe your power; and even those
   you hold at the expense of the West Indies. To avoid a defeat, or prevent
   a desertion of your troops, you have taken up your quarters in holes and
   corners of inaccessible security; and in order to conceal what every one
   can perceive, you now endeavor to impose your weakness upon us for an act
   of mercy. If you think to succeed by such shadowy devices, you are but
   infants in the political world; you have the A, B, C, of stratagem yet to
   learn, and are wholly ignorant of the people you have to contend with.
   Like men in a state of intoxication, you forget that the rest of the world
   have eyes, and that the same stupidity which conceals you from yourselves
   exposes you to their satire and contempt.

   The paragraph which I have quoted, stands as an introduction to the
   following: "But when that country [America] professes the unnatural
   design, not only of estranging herself from us, but of mortgaging herself
   and her resources to our enemies, the whole contest is changed: and the
   question is how far Great Britain may, by every means in her power,
   destroy or render useless, a connection contrived for her ruin, and the
   aggrandizement of France. Under such circumstances, the laws of
   self-preservation must direct the conduct of Britain, and, if the British
   colonies are to become an accession to France, will direct her to render
   that accession of as little avail as possible to her enemy."

   I consider you in this declaration, like madmen biting in the hour of
   death. It contains likewise a fraudulent meanness; for, in order to
   justify a barbarous conclusion, you have advanced a false position. The
   treaty we have formed with France is open, noble, and generous. It is true
   policy, founded on sound philosophy, and neither a surrender or mortgage,
   as you would scandalously insinuate. I have seen every article, and speak
   from positive knowledge. In France, we have found an affectionate friend
   and faithful ally; in Britain, we have found nothing but tyranny, cruelty,
   and infidelity.

   But the happiness is, that the mischief you threaten, is not in your power
   to execute; and if it were, the punishment would return upon you in a
   ten-fold degree. The humanity of America has hitherto restrained her from
   acts of retaliation, and the affection she retains for many individuals in
   England, who have fed, clothed and comforted her prisoners, has, to the
   present day, warded off her resentment, and operated as a screen to the
   whole. But even these considerations must cease, when national objects
   interfere and oppose them. Repeated aggravations will provoke a retort,
   and policy justify the measure. We mean now to take you seriously up upon
   your own ground and principle, and as you do, so shall you be done by.

   You ought to know, gentlemen, that England and Scotland, are far more
   exposed to incendiary desolation than America, in her present state, can
   possibly be. We occupy a country, with but few towns, and whose riches
   consist in land and annual produce. The two last can suffer but little,
   and that only within a very limited compass. In Britain it is otherwise.
   Her wealth lies chiefly in cities and large towns, the depositories of
   manufactures and fleets of merchantmen. There is not a nobleman's country
   seat but may be laid in ashes by a single person. Your own may probably
   contribute to the proof: in short, there is no evil which cannot be
   returned when you come to incendiary mischief. The ships in the Thames,
   may certainly be as easily set on fire, as the temporary bridge was a few
   years ago; yet of that affair no discovery was ever made; and the loss you
   would sustain by such an event, executed at a proper season, is infinitely
   greater than any you can inflict. The East India House and the Bank,
   neither are nor can be secure from this sort of destruction, and, as Dr.
   Price justly observes, a fire at the latter would bankrupt the nation. It
   has never been the custom of France and England when at war, to make those
   havocs on each other, because the ease with which they could retaliate
   rendered it as impolitic as if each had destroyed his own.

   But think not, gentlemen, that our distance secures you, or our invention
   fails us. We can much easier accomplish such a point than any nation in
   Europe. We talk the same language, dress in the same habit, and appear
   with the same manners as yourselves. We can pass from one part of England
   to another unsuspected; many of us are as well acquainted with the country
   as you are, and should you impolitically provoke us, you will most
   assuredly lament the effects of it. Mischiefs of this kind require no army
   to execute them. The means are obvious, and the opportunities unguardable.
   I hold up a warning to our senses, if you have any left, and "to the
   unhappy people likewise, whose affairs are committed to you."* I call not
   with the rancor of an enemy, but the earnestness of a friend, on the
   deluded people of England, lest, between your blunders and theirs, they
   sink beneath the evils contrived for us.

   * General [Sir H.] Clinton's letter to Congress.

   "He who lives in a glass house," says a Spanish proverb, "should never
   begin throwing stones." This, gentlemen, is exactly your case, and you
   must be the most ignorant of mankind, or suppose us so, not to see on
   which side the balance of accounts will fall. There are many other modes
   of retaliation, which, for several reasons, I choose not to mention. But
   be assured of this, that the instant you put your threat into execution, a
   counter-blow will follow it. If you openly profess yourselves savages, it
   is high time we should treat you as such, and if nothing but distress can
   recover you to reason, to punish will become an office of charity.

   While your fleet lay last winter in the Delaware, I offered my service to
   the Pennsylvania Navy Board then at Trenton, as one who would make a party
   with them, or any four or five gentlemen, on an expedition down the river
   to set fire to it, and though it was not then accepted, nor the thing
   personally attempted, it is more than probable that your own folly will
   provoke a much more ruinous act. Say not when mischief is done, that you
   had not warning, and remember that we do not begin it, but mean to repay
   it. Thus much for your savage and impolitic threat.

   In another part of your proclamation you say, "But if the honors of a
   military life are become the object of the Americans, let them seek those
   honors under the banners of their rightful sovereign, and in fighting the
   battles of the united British Empire, against our late mutual and natural
   enemies." Surely! the union of absurdity with madness was never marked in
   more distinguishable lines than these. Your rightful sovereign, as you
   call him, may do well enough for you, who dare not inquire into the humble
   capacities of the man; but we, who estimate persons and things by their
   real worth, cannot suffer our judgments to be so imposed upon; and unless
   it is your wish to see him exposed, it ought to be your endeavor to keep
   him out of sight. The less you have to say about him the better. We have
   done with him, and that ought to be answer enough. You have been often
   told so. Strange! that the answer must be so often repeated. You go
   a-begging with your king as with a brat, or with some unsaleable commodity
   you were tired of; and though every body tells you no, no, still you keep
   hawking him about. But there is one that will have him in a little time,
   and as we have no inclination to disappoint you of a customer, we bid
   nothing for him.

   The impertinent folly of the paragraph that I have just quoted, deserves
   no other notice than to be laughed at and thrown by, but the principle on
   which it is founded is detestable. We are invited to submit to a man who
   has attempted by every cruelty to destroy us, and to join him in making
   war against France, who is already at war against him for our support.

   Can Bedlam, in concert with Lucifer, form a more mad and devilish request?
   Were it possible a people could sink into such apostacy they would deserve
   to be swept from the earth like the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. The
   proposition is an universal affront to the rank which man holds in the
   creation, and an indignity to him who placed him there. It supposes him
   made up without a spark of honor, and under no obligation to God or man.

   What sort of men or Christians must you suppose the Americans to be, who,
   after seeing their most humble petitions insultingly rejected; the most
   grievous laws passed to distress them in every quarter; an undeclared war
   let loose upon them, and Indians and negroes invited to the slaughter;
   who, after seeing their kinsmen murdered, their fellow citizens starved to
   death in prisons, and their houses and property destroyed and burned; who,
   after the most serious appeals to heaven, the most solemn abjuration by
   oath of all government connected with you, and the most heart-felt pledges
   and protestations of faith to each other; and who, after soliciting the
   friendship, and entering into alliances with other nations, should at last
   break through all these obligations, civil and divine, by complying with
   your horrid and infernal proposal. Ought we ever after to be considered as
   a part of the human race? Or ought we not rather to be blotted from the
   society of mankind, and become a spectacle of misery to the world? But
   there is something in corruption, which, like a jaundiced eye, transfers
   the color of itself to the object it looks upon, and sees every thing
   stained and impure; for unless you were capable of such conduct
   yourselves, you would never have supposed such a character in us. The
   offer fixes your infamy. It exhibits you as a nation without faith; with
   whom oaths and treaties are considered as trifles, and the breaking them
   as the breaking of a bubble. Regard to decency, or to rank, might have
   taught you better; or pride inspired you, though virtue could not. There
   is not left a step in the degradation of character to which you can now
   descend; you have put your foot on the ground floor, and the key of the
   dungeon is turned upon you.

   That the invitation may want nothing of being a complete monster, you have
   thought proper to finish it with an assertion which has no foundation,
   either in fact or philosophy; and as Mr. Ferguson, your secretary, is a
   man of letters, and has made civil society his study, and published a
   treatise on that subject, I address this part to him.

   In the close of the paragraph which I last quoted, France is styled the
   "natural enemy" of England, and by way of lugging us into some strange
   idea, she is styled "the late mutual and natural enemy" of both countries.
   I deny that she ever was the natural enemy of either; and that there does
   not exist in nature such a principle. The expression is an unmeaning
   barbarism, and wholly unphilosophical, when applied to beings of the same
   species, let their station in the creation be what it may. We have a
   perfect idea of a natural enemy when we think of the devil, because the
   enmity is perpetual, unalterable and unabateable. It admits, neither of
   peace, truce, or treaty; consequently the warfare is eternal, and
   therefore it is natural. But man with man cannot arrange in the same
   opposition. Their quarrels are accidental and equivocally created. They
   become friends or enemies as the change of temper, or the cast of interest
   inclines them. The Creator of man did not constitute them the natural
   enemy of each other. He has not made any one order of beings so. Even
   wolves may quarrel, still they herd together. If any two nations are so,
   then must all nations be so, otherwise it is not nature but custom, and
   the offence frequently originates with the accuser. England is as truly
   the natural enemy of France, as France is of England, and perhaps more so.
   Separated from the rest of Europe, she has contracted an unsocial habit of
   manners, and imagines in others the jealousy she creates in herself. Never
   long satisfied with peace, she supposes the discontent universal, and
   buoyed up with her own importance, conceives herself the only object
   pointed at. The expression has been often used, and always with a
   fraudulent design; for when the idea of a natural enemy is conceived, it
   prevents all other inquiries, and the real cause of the quarrel is hidden
   in the universality of the conceit. Men start at the notion of a natural
   enemy, and ask no other question. The cry obtains credit like the alarm of
   a mad dog, and is one of those kind of tricks, which, by operating on the
   common passions, secures their interest through their folly.

   But we, sir, are not to be thus imposed upon. We live in a large world,
   and have extended our ideas beyond the limits and prejudices of an island.
   We hold out the right hand of friendship to all the universe, and we
   conceive that there is a sociality in the manners of France, which is much
   better disposed to peace and negotiation than that of England, and until
   the latter becomes more civilized, she cannot expect to live long at peace
   with any power. Her common language is vulgar and offensive, and children
   suck in with their milk the rudiments of insult- "The arm of Britain! The
   mighty arm of Britain! Britain that shakes the earth to its center and its
   poles! The scourge of France! The terror of the world! That governs with a
   nod, and pours down vengeance like a God." This language neither makes a
   nation great or little; but it shows a savageness of manners, and has a
   tendency to keep national animosity alive. The entertainments of the stage
   are calculated to the same end, and almost every public exhibition is
   tinctured with insult. Yet England is always in dread of France,-
   terrified at the apprehension of an invasion, suspicious of being
   outwitted in a treaty, and privately cringing though she is publicly
   offending. Let her, therefore, reform her manners and do justice, and she
   will find the idea of a natural enemy to be only a phantom of her own
   imagination.

   Little did I think, at this period of the war, to see a proclamation which
   could promise you no one useful purpose whatever, and tend only to expose
   you. One would think that you were just awakened from a four years' dream,
   and knew nothing of what had passed in the interval. Is this a time to be
   offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and
   taxation? Is it worth your while, after every force has failed you, to
   retreat under the shelter of argument and persuasion? Or can you think
   that we, with nearly half your army prisoners, and in alliance with
   France, are to be begged or threatened into submission by a piece of
   paper? But as commissioners at a hundred pounds sterling a week each, you
   conceive yourselves bound to do something, and the genius of ill-fortune
   told you, that you must write.

   For my own part, I have not put pen to paper these several months.
   Convinced of our superiority by the issue of every campaign, I was
   inclined to hope, that that which all the rest of the world now see, would
   become visible to you, and therefore felt unwilling to ruffle your temper
   by fretting you with repetitions and discoveries. There have been
   intervals of hesitation in your conduct, from which it seemed a pity to
   disturb you, and a charity to leave you to yourselves. You have often
   stopped, as if you intended to think, but your thoughts have ever been too
   early or too late.

   There was a time when Britain disdained to answer, or even hear a petition
   from America. That time is past and she in her turn is petitioning our
   acceptance. We now stand on higher ground, and offer her peace; and the
   time will come when she, perhaps in vain, will ask it from us. The latter
   case is as probable as the former ever was. She cannot refuse to
   acknowledge our independence with greater obstinacy than she before
   refused to repeal her laws; and if America alone could bring her to the
   one, united with France she will reduce her to the other. There is
   something in obstinacy which differs from every other passion; whenever it
   fails it never recovers, but either breaks like iron, or crumbles sulkily
   away like a fractured arch. Most other passions have their periods of
   fatigue and rest; their suffering and their cure; but obstinacy has no
   resource, and the first wound is mortal. You have already begun to give it
   up, and you will, from the natural construction of the vice, find
   yourselves both obliged and inclined to do so.

   If you look back you see nothing but loss and disgrace. If you look
   forward the same scene continues, and the close is an impenetrable gloom.
   You may plan and execute little mischiefs, but are they worth the expense
   they cost you, or will such partial evils have any effect on the general
   cause? Your expedition to Egg Harbor, will be felt at a distance like an
   attack upon a hen-roost, and expose you in Europe, with a sort of childish
   frenzy. Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you in writing
   proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters? Possessing
   yourselves of towns is not conquest, but convenience, and in which you
   will one day or other be trepanned. Your retreat from Philadelphia, was
   only a timely escape, and your next expedition may be less fortunate.

   It would puzzle all the politicians in the universe to conceive what you
   stay for, or why you should have stayed so long. You are prosecuting a war
   in which you confess you have neither object nor hope, and that conquest,
   could it be effected, would not repay the charges: in the mean while the
   rest of your affairs are running to ruin, and a European war kindling
   against you. In such a situation, there is neither doubt nor difficulty;
   the first rudiments of reason will determine the choice, for if peace can
   be procured with more advantages than even a conquest can be obtained, he
   must be an idiot indeed that hesitates.

   But you are probably buoyed up by a set of wretched mortals, who, having
   deceived themselves, are cringing, with the duplicity of a spaniel, for a
   little temporary bread. Those men will tell you just what you please. It
   is their interest to amuse, in order to lengthen out their protection.
   They study to keep you amongst them for that very purpose; and in
   proportion as you disregard their advice, and grow callous to their
   complaints, they will stretch into improbability, and season their
   flattery the higher. Characters like these are to be found in every
   country, and every country will despise them.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 20, 1778.
