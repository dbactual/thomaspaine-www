   To Thomas Jefferson  September 15, 1789

   LONDON,

   DEAR SIR:

   By some accident your favor of the 23 July did not come to hand till a few
   days ago. It had lain at Mr. Clagget's in America Square. On my return to
   London Mr. Morris and Mr. Parker were set off, the former for France, the
   latter for Holland. They are both expected to return here in

   a few days.

   My Bridge goes excellently on, and my Partners (the Walkers) who are at
   all the expense except the erecting it in London, which is my part, have
   full as much confidence in the work as myself. About three fourths of it
   are already finished. We have erected two of the Ribs at the works, and
   our intention is to erect the whole there that we may be certain of all
   the parts fitting before we bring it to London. Not a single mistake has
   hitherto occurred. When I left Paris I was to return with the model, but I
   could now bring over a complete bridge. Though I have a slender opinion of
   myself for executive business, I think, upon the whole that I have managed
   this matter tolerably well. With no money to spare for such an undertaking
   I am the sole patentee here, and connected with one of the first and best
   established houses in the nation. But absent from America I feel a craving
   desire to return and I can scarcely forbear weeping at the thoughts of
   your going and my staying behind.

   Accept my dear Sir, my most hearty thanks for your many services and
   friendship. Remember me with an overflowing affection to my dear
   America-the people and the place. Be so kind to shake hands with them for
   me, and tell our beloved General Washington, and my old friend Dr.
   Franklin how much I long to see them. I wish you would spend a day with
   General [Lewis] Morris of Morrisania, and present best wishes to all the
   family. But I find myself wandering into a melancholy subject that will be
   tiresome to read,-so wishing you a prosperous passage, and a happy meeting
   with all your friends and mine

   I remain yours affectionately, etc.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   I shall be very glad to hear from you when you arrive. If you direct for
   me to the care of Mr. Benjamin Vaughn it will find me. Please present my
   friendship to Captain Nicholson and family of New York, and to Mr. and
   Mrs. Few.
