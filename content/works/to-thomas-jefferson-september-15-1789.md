   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   London Sep. 15. 1789

   My Dear Sir

   By some accident your favour of the 23d July did not come to hand till a few
   days ago. It had lain at Mr. Claggets in America Square &mdash; On my return 
   to London Mr. Morris and Mr. Parker were sett off, the former for France, the
   latter for Holland &mdash; they are both expected to return here in a few 
   days.

   My Bridge goes excellently on, and my Partners (the Walkers) who are at
   all the expence except the erecting it in London, which is my part, have
   full as much confidence in the Work as myself &mdash; about three fourths 
   of it are already finished &mdash; we have erected two of the Ribs at the 
   Works, and our intention is to erect the whole there that we may be certain 
   of all the parts fitting before we bring it to London &mdash; not a single 
   mistake has hitherto occurred &mdash; When I left Paris I was to return with 
   the Model, but I could now bring over a compleat Bridge. Tho' I have a slender 
   opinion of myself for executive Business, I think, upon the whole that I have 
   managed this matter tolerably well. With no money to spare for such an 
   undertaking I am the Sole Patentee here, and connected with one of the first 
   and best established houses in the Nation, but absent from America I feel a 
   craving desire to return and I can scarcely forbear weeping at the thought of
   your going and my staying behind.

   Accept my dear Sir, my most hearty thanks for your many services and
   friendship &mdash; Remember me with an overflowing affection to my dear
   America &mdash; the people and the place &mdash; be so kind to shake hands 
   with them for me and tell our beloved General Washington, and my old friend 
   Dr. Franklin how much I long to see them. I wish you would spend a day with
   General Morris of Morrisania and present best wishes to all the
   family &mdash; But I find myself wandering into a melancholy subject that 
   will be tiresome to read so wishing you a prosperous passage, and a happy 
   meeting with all your friends and mine. I remain yours affectionately

   THOMAS PAINE

   I shall be very glad to hear from you when you arrive &mdash; If you direct 
   for me to the care of Mr. Benjn. Vaughn it will find me &mdash; 
   
   Please present my friendship to Captain Nicholson and Family of N. York, 
   and to Mr. and Mrs. Few.
