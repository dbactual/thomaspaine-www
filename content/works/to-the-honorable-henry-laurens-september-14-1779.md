   To the Honorable Henry Laurens  September 14, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   DEAR SIR:

   It was my intention to have communicated to you the substance of this
   letter last Sunday had I not been prevented by a return of my fever;
   perhaps finding myself unwell, and feeling, as well as apprehending,
   inconveniences, have produced in me some thoughts for myself as well as
   for others. I need not repeat to you the part I have acted or the
   principle I have acted upon; and perhaps America would feel the less
   obligation to me, did she know, that it was neither the place nor the
   people but the Cause itself that irresistibly engaged me in its support;
   for I should have acted the same part in any other country could the same
   circumstances have arisen there which have happened here. I have often
   been obliged to form this distinction to myself by way of smoothing over
   some disagreeable ingratitudes, which, you well know, have been shown to
   me from a certain quarter.

   I find myself so curiously circumstanced that I have both too many friends
   and too few, the generality of them thinking that from the public part I
   have so long acted I cannot have less than a mine to draw from. What they
   have had from me they have got for nothing, and they consequently suppose
   I must be able to afford it. I know but one kind of life I am fit for, and
   that is a thinking one, and, of course, a writing one-but I have confined
   myself so much of late, taken so little exercise, and lived so very
   sparingly, that unless I alter my way of life it will alter me. I think I
   have a right to ride a horse of my own, but I cannot-now even afford to
   hire one, which is a situation I never was in before, and I begin to know
   that a sedentary life cannot be supported without jolting exercise. Having
   said thus much, which, in truth, is but loss of time to tell to you who so
   well know how I am situated, I take the liberty of communicating to you my
   design of doing some degree of justice to myself, but even this is
   accompanied with some present difficulties, but it is the easiest, and, I
   believe, the most useful and reputable of any I can think of. I intend
   this winter to collect all my publications, beginning with Common Sense
   and ending with the Fisheries, and publishing them in two volumes, octavo,
   with notes. I have no doubt of a large subscription. The principal
   difficulty will be to get paper and I can think of no way more practicable
   than to desire Arthur Lee to send over a quantity from France in the
   Confederacy if she goes there, and settling for it with his brother. After
   that work is completed, I intend prosecuting a history of the Revolution
   by means of a subscription-but this undertaking will be attended with such
   an amazing expense, and will take such a length of time, that unless the
   States individually give some assistance therein, scarcely any man could
   afford to go through it. Some kind of an history might be easily executed
   made up of daily events and trifling matters which would lose their
   importance in a few years. But a proper history cannot even be begun
   unless the secrets of the other side of the water can be obtained, for the
   first part is so interwoven with the politics of England that that which
   will be the last to get at must be the first to begin with-and this single
   instance is sufficient to show that no history can take place for some
   time. My design, if I undertake it, is to comprise it in three quarto
   volumes and to publish one each year from the time of beginning, and to
   make an abridgment afterwards in an easy agreeable language for a school
   book. All the histories of ancient wars that are used for this purpose
   promote no moral reflection, but like the Beggars Opera renders the
   villain pleasing in the hero. Another thing that will prolong the
   completion of an history is the want of plates which only can be done in
   Europe, for that part of a history which is intended to convey description
   of places or persons will ever be imperfect without them. I have now, sir,
   acquainted you with my design, and unwilling, as you know I am, to make
   use of a friend while I can possibly avoid it, I am really obliged to say
   that I should now be glad to consult with two or three on some matters
   that regard my situation till such time as I can bring the first of those
   subscriptions to bear, or set them on foot, which cannot well be until I
   can get the paper; for should I be disappointed of that, with the
   subscriptions in my hand, I might be reflected upon, and the reason,
   though a true one, would be subject to other explanations.

   Here lies the difficulty I alluded to in the beginning of this letter, and
   I would rather wish to borrow something of a friend or two in the interim
   than run the risk I have mentioned, because should I be disappointed by
   the paper being taken or not arriving in time, the reason being understood
   by them beforehand will not injure me, but in the other case it would, and
   in the mean time I can be preparing for publication. I have hitherto kept
   all my private matters a secret, but as I know your friendship and you a
   great deal of my situation, I can with more ease communicate them to you
   than to another.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. If you are not engaged to-morrow evening I should be glad to spend
   part of it with you-if you are, I shall wait your opportunity.
