   To Honorable Benjamin Franklin LL.D.  June 20th, 1777

   PHILADELPHIA,

   MY DEAR SIR:

   I have just time to write you a word or two, and have the pleasure of
   acquainting you of my being appointed Secretary to the Committee for
   Foreign Affairs. I conceive the honor to be the greater as the appointment
   was [not] only unsolicited on my part but made unknown to me.

   The news of your safe arrival in France was received here with
   inexpressible satisfaction. The New York Gentry were very early acquainted
   with your setting off. I was at that time, at Fort Lee and saw the account
   of it in the New York papers the fourth day after your departure from
   Philadelphia, which greatly increased my anxiety for your safety, as I
   apprehended they would endeavor to make some use of the information. There
   has been such a wonderful and visible chain of matters, without the
   disorder of a s[ingle] link, in bringing this important affair to an
   issue, that a man must be an infidel not to think heaven has some hand in
   it.

   I send you two or three sets of a little production of mine (the Crisis)
   being all which are left at the Printers out of eighteen thousand besides
   which have been printed in the other States. You will see by the first
   number and date that it was written in a rage when our affairs were at
   their lowest ebb and things in the most gloomy state. I think Almon might
   venture to publish the second number but if any of them be published in
   France, some republican expressions should be omitted.

   I intend next winter to begin on the first volume of the Revolution of
   America, when I mentioned it to you the winter before last you was so kind
   as to offer me such materials in your possession as might be necessary for
   that purpose. As I imagine you will appear in a new edition by some
   capital engraver at Paris I beg to be favored with a copy and shall be
   exceedingly obliged if you could by the next conveyance send me the
   Gentlemans and Universal Magazines for '74, '75 and '76, the two Reviews
   and Parliamentary debates for the same year, and such as are come out
   since and the last Court Register. Please to make the charge and I will
   pay it to Mr. Bache.

   I am Honored Sir Your Obliged and Affectionate Humble Servant,

   T. P.

   P. S. Please to present my respect to your colleagues. I send you the last
   paper.
