   To Daniel Isaacs Eaton  December 4, 1795

   PARIS,

   SIR:

   I have seen advertised in the London papers the second Edition of the Age
   of Reason printed, the advertisement says, from the Author s Manuscript,
   and entered at Stationers Hall. I have never sent any manuscript to any
   person. It is therefore a forgery to say it is printed from the author's
   manuscript; and I suppose is done to give the Publisher a pretence of Copy
   Right, which he has no title to.

   I send you a printed copy, which is the only edition I have sent to
   London. I wish you to make a cheap edition of it. I know not by what means
   any copy has got over to London. If any person has made a manuscript copy
   I have no doubt but it is full of errors. I wish you would talk to Mr.___
   upon this subject as I wish to know by what means this trick has been
   played, and from whom the publisher has got possession of any copy.

   T. PAINE.
