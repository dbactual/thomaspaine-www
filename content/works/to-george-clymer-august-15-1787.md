   To George Clymer  August 15, 1787

   PARIS,.

   SIR:

   This comes by Mr. Derby, of Massachusetts, who leaves Paris today to take
   shipping at L'Orient for Boston. The enclosed for Dr. Franklin is from his
   friend Mr. Le Roy, of the Academy of Sciences, respecting the bridge, and
   the causes that have delayed the completing the report. An arch of 4 or 5
   hundred feet is such an unprecedented thing, and will so much attract
   notice in the northern part of Europe, that the Academy is cautious in
   what manner to express their final opinion. It is, I find, their custom to
   give reasons for their opinion, and this embarrasses them more than the
   opinion itself. That the model is strong, and that a bridge constructed on
   the same principles will also be strong, they appear to be well agreed in,
   but to what particular causes to assign the strength they are not agreed
   in. The committee was directed by the Academy to examine all the models
   and plans for iron bridges that had been proposed in France, and they
   unanimously gave the preference to our own, as being the simplest,
   strongest, and lightest. They have likewise agreed on some material
   points.

   THOMAS PAINE.
