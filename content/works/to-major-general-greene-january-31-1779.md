   To Major-General Greene  January 31, 1779
   
   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.

   Dear Sir

   You doubtless think it strange I have not, as usual, called to see you. I
   have been out no where, and was resolved not to go out, till I had set
   every thing to rights. &mdash; I know how it must end because I have it in my
   hands &mdash; The roguery will soon come out, and as I was determined to answer
   no questions upon the Subject. I thought it best to put it out of every
   body's power to ask me any &mdash; but finding you go tomorrow I must break this
   my resolve by calling upon you to day &mdash; I have acquainted his Excellency
   with the same reasons &mdash;

   Notwithstanding my absence, set me down as one your most attached friends,
   and in return remember your 
   
   Obt Hble Servt

   THOS PAINE

   P. S. If you should be off when I call I wish you would leave word when
   you will be at home.
