   To Major-General Greene  January 31, 1779

   DEAR SIR:

   You doubtless think it strange I have not as usual, called to see you. I
   have been out no where, and was resolved not to go out, till I had set
   every thing to rights. I know how it must end because I have it in my
   hands. The roguiry will soon come out, and as I was determined to answer
   no questions upon the subject. I thought it best to put it out of every
   body's power to ask me any, but finding you go tomorrow I must break this
   my resolve by calling upon you to-day. I have acquainted his Excellency
   with the same reasons.

   Notwithstanding my absence, set me down as one your most attached friends,
   and in return remember your obedient humble servant

   THOS PAINE.

   P. S. If you should be off when I call I wish you would leave word when
   you will be at home.
