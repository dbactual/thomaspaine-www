   American rights on the high seas.

                                 **************

   EVERY one asks, Will there be war? The answer to this is easy, which is,
   That so long as the English Government be permitted, at her own
   discretion, to search, capture, and condemn our vessels, control our
   commerce, impress our seamen, and fire upon and plunder our national
   ships, as she has done, she will Not Declare War, because she will not
   give us the acknowledged right of making reprisals. Her plan is a monopoly
   of war, and she thinks to succeed by the maneuver of not declaring war. 

   The case then is altogether a question among ourselves. Shall we make war
   on the English Government, as the English Government has made upon us; or
   shall we submit, as we have done, and that with long forbearance, to the
   evil of having war made upon us without reprisals? This is a right
   statement of the case between the United States and England.

   For several years past it has been the scheme of that Government to
   terrify us, by acts of violence, into submission to her measures, and in
   the insane stupidity of attempting this, she has incensed us into war. We
   neither fear nor care about England, otherwise than pitying the people who
   live under such a wretched system of government. As to navies, they have
   lost their terrifying powers. They can do nothing against us at land, and
   if they come within our waters, they will be taken the first calm that
   comes. They can rob us on the ocean, as robbers can do, and we can find a
   way to indemnify ourselves by reprisals, in more ways than one.

   The British Government is not entitled, even as an enemy, to be treated as
   civilized enemies are treated. She is a pirate, and should be treated as a
   pirate. Nations do not declare war against pirates, but attack them as a
   natural right. All civilities shown to the British Government, is like
   pearl[s] thrown before a swine. She is insensible of principle and
   destitute of honor. Her monarch is mad, and her ministers have caught the
   contagion.

   The British Government, and also the nation, deceive themselves with
   respect to the power of navies. They suppose that ships of war can make
   conquests at land; that they can take or destroy towns or cities near the
   shore and obtain by terror what terms they please. They sent Admiral
   Duckworth to Constantinople upon this stupid idea, and the event has shown
   to the world the imbecility of navies against cannon on shore.
   Constantinople was not fortified any more than our American towns are now;
   but the Turks, on the appearance of the British fleet, got five hundred
   cannon and a hundred mortars down from the arsenals to the shore, and the
   blustering heroes of the navy seeing this, fled like a hound with a rattle
   at his tail. The gallant people of Norfolk and its neighborhood have sent
   Douglas off in a similar manner. An Indian who studies nature is a better
   judge of naval power than an English minister.

   In March, 1777, soon after taking the Hessians at Trenton, I was at a
   treaty held with the five northern nations of Indians at East Town, in
   Pennsylvania, and was often pleased with the sagacious remarks of those
   original people. The chief of one of the tribes, who went by the name of
   King Lastnight, because his tribe had sold their lands, had seen some
   English men of war in some of the waters of Canada and was impressed with
   an idea of the power of those great canoes; but he saw that the English
   made no progress against us by land. This was enough for an Indian to form
   an opinion by. He could speak some English, and in conversation with me,
   alluding to the great canoes, he gave me his idea of the power of a king
   of England by the following metaphor.

   "The king of England," said he, "is like a fish. When he is in the water
   he can wag his tail.-When he comes on land he lays down on his side." Now,
   if the English Government had but half the sense this Indian had, they
   would not have sent Duckworth to Constantinople, and Douglas to Norfolk,
   to lay down on their side.

   Accounts from Halifax state, that Admiral Berkeley has alleged in writing,
   that "his orders (to Douglas) were not issued until every application to
   restore the mutineers and deserters (as he calls them) had been made by
   his Britannic Majesty's ministers, consul, and officer, and had been
   refused by the Government of the United States."

   If this account be true, it shows that Berkeley is an idiot in
   governmental affairs; for if the matter was in the hands of the British
   minister, who is the immediate representative of his Government, Berkeley
   could have no interference in it. That minister would report to his
   Government the demand he made, if he made any, and the answer he received,
   if he received any, and Berkeley could act only in consequence of orders
   received afterwards. It does not belong to subordinate officers of any
   Government to commence hostilities at their own discretion.

   I now come to speak of the politics of the day as they rise out of the
   circumstances that have taken place.

   The injustice of the British Government, and the insolence of its naval
   officers, is no longer to be borne. That injustice, and that insolence
   grows out of a presumption the British Government has set up, which it
   calls "the right of search." There is not, nor ever was, such a right
   appertaining to a nation in consequence of its being in war with another
   nation. Wherever such a right existed it has been by treaty, and where no
   such treaty exist, no such right can exist, and to assume the exercise of
   it is an act of hostility which if not abandoned must be repelled until it
   be abandoned. The United States cannot even cede such a right to England,
   without ceding the same right to France, Spain, Holland, Naples, Italy,
   and Turkey, or they will take it, and the United States must take the
   consequence. It is [a] very difficult matter, and requires great political
   wisdom for a neutral nation to make a treaty during a time of war with one
   belligerent nation, that shall not commit her with the other. The best way
   then, since matters are come to the extremity they are, is to resist this
   pretended right of search in the first instance. The United States are
   able to do it, and she is the only neutral nation that is able.

   We are not the diminutive people now that we were when the revolution
   began. Our population then was two millions and an half, it is now between
   six and seven millions, and in less than ten years will exceed the
   population of England. The United States have increased more in power,
   ability, and wealth within the last twenty or twenty-two years than she
   did for almost two hundred years before, while the states were British
   Colonies.

   She owes this to two things, independence and the representative system of
   Government. It was always the ill-judged and impracticable system of the
   British Government to keep the Colonies in a state of continual nonage.
   They never were to be of full age that she might always control them.

   While the United States have been going forward in this unparalleled
   manner, England has been going backward. Her Government is a bankrupt, and
   her people miserable. More than a million of them are paupers. Her king is
   mad, and her parliament is corrupt. We have yet to see what the present
   new elected parliament will be. There is one man in it, whom I proudly
   call a friend, from whom there will be great expectations; but what can
   one honest independent member do, surrounded by such a mass of ignorance
   and corruption as have for many years past governed that unfortunate
   nation.

   The great dependence of England has been on her navy, and it is her navy
   that has been her ruin. The falsely imagined power of that navy (for it
   was necessary it should be amphibious to perform what was expected from
   it) has prompted the ignorance of her Government into insolence towards
   all foreign powers till England has not a friend left among nations.
   Russia and Sweden will quarter themselves upon her purse till it becomes
   empty, and then very probably will turn against her.

   Depending on her navy she blockaded whole countries by proclamation, and
   now, Bonaparte, by way of justifiable retaliation, has blockaded her by
   land from the commerce of the western part of the Continent of Europe. Her
   insolent and imbecile expedition to Constantinople, has excluded her from
   the commerce of Turkish Europe and Turkey in Asia, and thrown it into the
   hands of France-and her outrageous conduct to us will exclude her from the
   commerce of the United States. By the insolence of the crew of her navy
   she is in danger of losing her trade to China; and it is easy to see that
   Bonaparte is paving his way to India by Turkey and Persia. The madness of
   the British Government has thrown Turkey into the arms of France. Persia
   lies between Turkey and India, and Bonaparte is forming friendly
   connections with the Persian Government. There is already an exchange of
   ambassadors. Bonaparte is sending military officers into Persia, and will,
   with the consent of its Government, raise an army there and attack the
   English monopoly in India. If France holds her connections with Turkey and
   Persia, England cannot hold India.

   It is in this wretched chaos of affairs that the mad Government of England
   has brought on herself a new enemy by commencing hostilities against the
   United States. She must be ignorant of the geography of America, or she
   would know that we can dispossess her of all her possessions on the
   Continent whenever we please, and she cannot, with safety, keep a fleet in
   the West Indies during the hurricane months. Bonaparte will find
   employment for every soldier she can raise, and those she may send to the
   Continent of Europe will become prisoners. There never was an instance of
   a Government conducting itself with the madness and ignorance the British
   Government has done! This is John Adams's stupendous fabric of human
   wisdom!

   That the British Government will disown giving hostile instructions to
   Berkeley I have no doubt. It is the trick of old governments to do so when
   they find themselves wrong, and pay some scapegoat to bear the blame. But
   this will not be sufficient. The pretended right of search and the
   impressment of our seamen must be abandoned. Three thousand of them have
   been impressed by British ships to fight against France. The French
   Government has shown a great deal of patience in not complaining of it,
   for it is a great injury to her, and must be redressed, or worse
   consequences will follow.

   I have said in the former part of this essay that it is a difficult matter
   and requires great political wisdom for a neutral nation during a war to
   form a treaty with one belligerent nation that shall not commit her with
   the other. I will now give an instance of it.

   In 1794, Washington sent Mr. Monroe as minister to France, and John Jay to
   England, and gave them contradictory instructions. By the treaty that then
   existed between the United States and France, "Free ships made free
   goods." So that English property on board American ships was protected
   from seizure by France. John Jay made a treaty with England which
   Washington and the stupid Senate of that day ratified, by which free ships
   DID NOT make free property, and that French property on board American
   ships could be seized by England. This of consequence vacated the free
   article in the treaty with France, and she availed herself of it, and the
   United States lost the carrying trade of both nations. There is a
   Jesuitism in Jay's treaty, which says, that the question whether free
   ships make free goods shall be taken into consideration two years after
   the war. It is now more than two years since that war, and therefore it
   forms an item with the matters to be now settled with the English
   Government.

   The British Government have been so long in the habit of insolence that
   she has not the sense of seeing when the power of being insolent ceases.
   She ought to see that the power of France by land is far superior to her
   power at sea. France, by land, can blockade the commerce of Eng- land out
   of Europe and India, and the English navy can do nothing to prevent it. Of
   what use is it to "rule the waves'' if you cannot put your foot on shore?
   If it was a contest for fisheries, the most powerful navy would decide;
   but as it is a contest for commerce it is land force that decides, and
   navies are out of the question.

   If the British Government were wise, she would cease the pretended right
   of search of her own accord, for it brings her into endless trouble. It
   makes all nations her enemy. Every nation detests the piratical insolence
   of England and none more so than the United States. The spirit that is now
   raised, cannot be appeased until reparation is made for the past, and
   security be given for the future.

   COMMON SENSE.
