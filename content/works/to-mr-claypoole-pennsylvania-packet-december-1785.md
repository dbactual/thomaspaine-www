   To Mr. Claypoole (Pennsylvania Packet)  December, 1785

   I have often observed paragraphs in your paper, in support or vindication
   of what always did appear to me a very wrong piece of policy, as well as
   an unconstitutional proceeding of the late Assembly-the violation of
   public faith in the repeal of the Bank charter.

   I sent you last Friday a short paragraph on that subject, which you have
   not inserted. If it is the plan of your paper to make itself a party paper
   in the business I shall understand the reason of its not being put in. If
   it is not a party paper I do not see the reason why it is withheld.

   Yours etc.

   THO PAINE.
