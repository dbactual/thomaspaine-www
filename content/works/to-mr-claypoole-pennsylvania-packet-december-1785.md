Title: To Mr. Claypoole (Pennsylvania Packet)  December, 1785
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:55 EDT 2014

   From the original letter at the New York Public Library.

   Mr. Claypoole &mdash; I have often observed paragraphs in your paper, 
   in support or vindication
   of what appears and always did to me a very wrong piece of policy, as well as
   an unconstitutional proceeding of the late Assembly &mdash; the violation of
   public faith in the repeal of the Bank Charter.

   I sent you last fryday a short paragraph on that subject, which you have
   not inserted &mdash; If it is the plan of your paper to make itself a 
   party paper
   in the business I shall understand the reason of its not being put in 
   &mdash; If it is not a party paper I do not see the reason why it is withheld.

   Yours &.

   THO PAINE
