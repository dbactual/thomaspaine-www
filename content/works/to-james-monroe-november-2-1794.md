   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.
   
   4th &mdash;
   
   Dear Sir

   I need not mention to you the happiness I received from the information
   you sent me by Mr. Beresford. I easily guess the persons you have
   conversed with on the subject of my liberation - but matters and even
   promises that pass in conversation are not quite so strictly attended to
   here as in the country you come from -

   I am not, my Dear Sir, impatient from any thing in my disposition - but the
   state of my health requires liberty and a better air, and besides this,
   the rules of the prison do not permit me, tho I have all the
   indulgences the concierge can give, to procure the things necessary to my
   recovery which is slow, as to strength. (I have a tolerable appetite but
   the allowance of provision is scanty - We are not allowed a knife to cut
   our victuals with, nor a razor to shave, but they have lately allowed some
   barbers that are here to shave.) The room where I am lodged is a ground floor 
   level with the earth in the
   garden and floored with brick, and is so wet after every rain that I
   cannot guard against taking colds that continually cheat my recovery. 
   
   If you could without interfering with, or deranging the mode proposed for my
   liberation, inform the Committee that the State of my health requires
   liberty and Air, it would be good ground to hasten my liberation -

   (The length of my imprisonment is also a reason, for I am now almost the
   oldest inhabitant of this uncomfortable mansion - and I see twenty, thirty
   and sometimes forty persons a day put in liberty who have not been so long
   confined as myself - Their liberation is a happiness to me, but I feel
   sometimes, a little mortification that I am thus left behind.) I leave it 
   entirely to you to arrange this matter - The messenger wait

   Yours affectionately

   T. P -

   I hope and wish much to see you - I have much to say. - I have had the
   attendance of Dr. Graham (Physician to Genl O'Hara (who is prisoner
   here) and of Dr. Makouski; house Physician, who has been most exceedingly
   kind to me - After I am at liberty I shall be glad to introduce him to you.
