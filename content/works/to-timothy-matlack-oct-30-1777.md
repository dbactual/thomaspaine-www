   To Timothy Matlack  Oct. 30, 1777

   GEN. GREENE'S QUARTERS,

   SIR:

   The enclosed were written when your Express came, please to convey them as
   directed. Your letter I observe is dated 26, four days ago. Suppose by
   this Time you have had particulars of Burgoyne's surrender. The bad
   weather and the high waters render it impossible to pass from one part of
   the camp to another. I understand by the Articles o-L- Capitulation which
   came to Headquarters that Burgoyne and his Army are to be sent to England.
   You will see my remarks on that Head in my letter to Col. Lee, which is
   enclosed and unsealed. No attempt has been made on the Forts since the 22d
   by the Hessians. Count Dunop is wounded and a Prisoner with about 200
   others killed, wounded and taken besides what wounded were carried into
   Philadelphia, which by ye account of persons who came out, exceed that
   number. For twenty-four pounds have been got from the wreck and more will
   yet be gotten. The Army is as well as can be expected after a long
   continuance of cold rain. I write this at Gen. Greene's. Shall go from
   hence to headquarters. If anything new there, I will either add it, or
   send another letter. I shall go forward [to] the forts this afternoon.

   THOMAS PAINE
