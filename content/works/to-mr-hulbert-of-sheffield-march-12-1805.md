Title: To Mr. Hulbert of Sheffield March 12, 1805
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:55 EDT 2014

   To Mr HULBERT, *of Sheffield, one of the mortified federal members of the Massachusetts legislature*
   
   from the *Aurora* in Philadelphia, March 12, 1805.

   WHEN the poison-tooth of a rattle snake is drawn, the bite and slaver of
   the reptile, like the slander and foam of Mr. Hulbert, become deprived of
   the power of injuring. The success of the republican ticket in
   Massachusetts has, at last, drawn the teeth of the rattle snake of
   federalism, and reduced the mischievous animal to laughable insignificance. 
   In this toothless and pitiless condition, the rattle in its
   tail, like the rattle of the legislator of Sheffield, is heard without
   alarm.

   Slander belongs to the class of dastardly vices. It always acts under
   cover. It puts insinuation in the place of evidence, and tries to impose
   by pretending to believe. Its loudest language, when it speaks, is a
   whisper. &mdash; At other times, it disguises itself in anonymous paragraphs, for
   which nobody is accountable. But it is a refinement on meanness when the
   slanderer covers himself with the privilege of a legislator speaking in
   his place. It requires no courage to tell a lie, insinuate a calumny,
   where the prerogative of the place protects him from punishment, and the
   absence of the person slandered precludes immediate detection, and this is
   what Hurlbert has done.

   Mr. Jefferson, at the distance of six or seven hundred miles, and myself
   at the distance of almost four hundred miles, have both been attacked in
   the legislature of Massachusetts, by this toothless rattlesnake, the
   legislator of Sheffield. Mr. Jefferson, as president of the United States,
   has other matters to attend to than that of answering this successor of
   Callender, who finished his career of slander by putting an end to his
   existence; and as to myself, Mr. Hulbert may see by the reply I now make
   to him, that I hold him and his abuse in laughable derision.

   One of his attacks on Mr. Jefferson is introduced in the following manner:

   "Does any one doubt (said he) that Mr. Jefferson invited Thomas Paine to
   leave France and return to the United States. &mdash; Let him read his letter and
   he will doubt no more." Here Hulbert read part of Mr. Jefferson's letter.

   Any one unacquainted with the case would suppose, from the mystification
   with which the legislator of Sheffield brought forward the letter that he
   had made a discovery that had remained concealed from all the world
   beside, and been miraculously revealed to him for the salvation of the
   feds. Poor foolish impostor!

   The whole of Mr. Jefferson's letter, to me, was published in my sixth letter
   to the citizens of the United States, the summer before last. The falling
   faction of the feds, feeling themselves sinking into the bottomless pit of
   public contempt, had been, for several months before, inventing and
   publishing falsehood upon falsehood with respect to the supposed contents
   of this letter, and when they had run their length, (for only give such
   people rope enough and they will hang themselves) I published the letter
   to expose their falshoods and put them to confusion. The letter when
   publicly known did honor to the writer of it, and the re-election of Mr.
   Jefferson, by a majority of one hundred and sixty-two votes, out of an
   hundred and seventy-six, confirms it to be a fact.

   The part which this toothless rattle snake, the aforesaid legislator of
   Sheffield, attacks, is that, in which Mr. Jefferson, after he arrived at
   the presidency, looks back with generous and even grateful remembrance (a
   virtue which the ulcerated heart of federalism knows nothing of,) on the
   long services of a former fellow labourer in the vineyard of independence.
   I was myself among the first that proposed independence, and it was Mr.
   Jefferson who drew up the declaration of it. Here follows the part which
   our graceless legislator read. It was in answer to a letter received from
   me:

   "You express a wish (says the letter) to return to America by a national
   ship. Mr. Dawson is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland to
   receive and accommodate you back, if you can be ready to depart at such a
   short notice. You will find us, in general, returned to sentiments worthy
   of former times. In these it will be your glory to have steadily laboured
   and with as much effect as any man living. That you may live long to
   continue your useful labours, and reap the reward in the thankfulness of
   nations, is my sincere prayer. Accept the assurances of my high esteem and
   affectionate attachment."

   THOMAS JEFFERSON.

   There is one thing, of which Mr. Hulbert may be assured, which is, that it
   is impossible for any man, whether president or private, to write such a
   letter to him, without telling a lie in every line.

   Our legislator (who is now acting the part of a slanderer and also of a
   hypocrite as I shall shew), having read this extract, proceeds with his
   remarks thereupon:

   "Is this, said he, the language of cold indifference? Is it the language
   of ordinary civility? No, (said he) it is the ardent expression of high
   esteem and affectionate attachment to one *of the most unprincipled and
   abandoned of the human race.*" &mdash; Well done thou herald of old Satan &mdash; thou
   shalt sit at his right hand.

   In the next paragraph our legislator goes a step further, for lying has no
   limit.

   It has been said, continues Hulbert, that the writings of Thomas Paine
   were useful to this country at the commencement of our revolution; so,
   said he, were the exertions of Benedict Arnold. Both were once useful men.
   *Both turned traitors to their country.*

   As it is totally unnecessary to contradict that which all the world knows
   to be a lie, I republish it to proclaim the ingratitude and baseness of
   its inventor.

   In the volcano of his abuse he next involves France, without knowing any
   thing of the subject he speaks of, except what one lying impostor of his
   own class had told to another.

   "It is true, said he (he ought to have said it is a lie) that by a
   national decree, all religion had been banished in France &mdash; the idea of a
   God discarded &mdash; and it had been, said he, impiously inscribed over the
   entrance of all the burying places in France, *that death was an eternal
   sleep!*"

   It would, perhaps, be happy for such unprincipled impostors as Hulbert, if
   it was true, that *death was an eternal sleep*, for he has much to answer
   for. But it is false to say, that such an inscription was put up by a
   national decree, or by any other decree or order whatever or that it was
   put up any where.

   It is also false that all religion in France was abolished by a decree.
   The national assembly passed a decree to banish the refractory priests,
   those who took the oath of fidelity to the republic, performed their
   worship as before, except they were prohibited making public processions
   in the streets with their crucifixes, images of the Virgin Mary, saints
   &c. and as to the Protestant church in the Rue St. Thomas, at Paris, the
   service in it was never interrupted.

   It is also false, that all idea of a God was discarded by a decree or by
   any authority whatever. The only decree that was passed by the convention,
   on the subject of creeds, is directly the reverse of what this imposter
   says. The decree was, "*the French people recognize the Supreme Being*,"
   that is, acknowledge and declare their belief in him; and this decree was
   inserted in the French language, on several of the churches where the
   constitutional priests officiated.

   There was also another inscription put up in the time of Robespierre in
   front of the building where the national convention sat, which, though it
   does honor to the French with respect to humanity, stands as a
   contradiction to this licentious libeller. The inscription was, "*The
   Divinity condemns tyrants; the French people execute the decree.*"

   The religious society of the Theophilanthropists, a word compounded of
   three Greek words, and meaning, *adorers of God and lovers of man*, was
   established in the time of the directory, and Ravelliere la Peaux, one of
   the five directors, was one of its principled founders. It professed two
   articles as its creed, *the belief of a God, and a state of future
   existence.* Its moral dogmas were exceedingly good.

   Having now detected Hulbert in his falsehoods not by mere assertion, as
   he deals in, but by the evidence of fact, I go to shew that he is an
   impostor and a hypocrite, for notwithstanding his clamour about religion,
   he does not believe the Christian religion himself, nor holds it to be
   true.

   It is neither his belief nor his disbelief that I trouble myself about.
   Every man must answer for the truth or falshood of his creed at the
   tribunal of *his creator*, and not to that of *man*, nor of one man to
   another. It is Hulbert's hypocrisy only that I expose.

   If Mr. Hulbert, or the speaker of the house of representatives, who heard
   his nonsense, will write to John Fellows, Water street, New York, he will
   be informed of the evidence that will prove the hypocrisy of Hulbert.

   Slander and hypocrisy are class mates in the school of vice. They are the
   necessary aids of each other. The same cowardly depravity of heart that
   leads to the one conducts to the other, and Hulbert has made the tour of
   both.

   Had not Hulbert profaned the sanctuary of legislation, and covered himself
   with the privilege of a legislator, to pour forth his abuse, his slander
   and his falshoods, he would have drawn no reply from me. I should have
   let him pass, unnoticed, among the group of nameless and indiscriminate
   libellers who have wasted their venom and their invention in vain.

   THOMAS PAINE.
