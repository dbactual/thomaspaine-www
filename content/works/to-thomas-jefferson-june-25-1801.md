   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Paris June 25 1801

   Dear Sir

   I write this merely to say there is nothing new to inform you of. Mr.
   Dawson whom I saw this morning when I gave him my letter on mechanics for
   you, tells me that the treaty is not ratified, and that he
   should send off the sloop the next day. - You will easily conclude from
   this delay in the ratification that something is the cause of it. It is
   however time the vessel should depart. If she lose this spring tide she
   must wait a fortnight longer. Havre is a very inconvenient post for
   any thing more than common merchant vessels to enter it, besides which the
   british know every day what is going on at Havre, and who goes in every
   vessel. They learn this by the fishermen. This is an additional reason for
   sending the next Vessel to some port on the Atlantic. The parliamentaire
   from America to Havre was taken in going out and carried into England. The
   pretence, as the papers say, was that a Swedish Minister was on board for
   America. If I had happened to have been there I suppose they would have
   made no ceremony in conducting me on shore. Havre, however, is, in form, a
   blockaded port. As I only catch a few minutes to write this scroll, and to
   say there is no news, you will excuse the insignificance of it.

   Your much obliged fellow citizen

   Thomas Paine
