   From the original letter at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania:  

   York Town, June 5th 1778

   Sir

   As a general opinion prevails that the Enemy will quit Philadelphia, I
   take the Liberty of transmitting you my reasons why it is probable they
   will not. In your difficult and distinguished situation every hint may be
   useful.

   I put the immediate cause of their evacuation, to be a declaration of war
   in Europe made by them or against them: in which case, their Army would be
   wanted for other Service, and likewise because their present Situation
   would be too unsafe, being subject to be blocked up by France and attacked
   by you and her jointly.

   Britain will avoid a war with France if she can; which, according to my
   arrangement of Politics she may easily do &mdash; She must see the necessity of
   acknowledging, sometime or other, the Independence of America; if she is
   wise enough to make that acknowledgement *now*, she of consequence admits
   the Right of France to the quiet enjoyment of her Treaty, and therefore no
   war can take place upon the ground of having concluded a Treaty with
   revolted British Subjects.

   This being admitted, their apprehensions of being doubly attacked, or of
   being wanted elsewhere; cease of consequence; and they will then endeavor
   to hold all they can, that they may have something to restore in lieu of
   something else which they will demand; as I know of no Instance where
   conquered Plans were surrendered up prior to, but only in consequence of a
   Treaty of Peace.

   You will observe, Sir, that my reasoning is founded on the supposition of
   their being reasonable beings, which if they are not, then they are not
   within the compass of my system.

   I am Sir with every wish for your happiness Your Affectionate and
   Obt. humble Servant

   THOS PAINE &mdash;
