   From the original letter at the New York Historical Society: 

   Philadelphia, January 2d, 1779.

   Dear Sir

   As I feel much concern at the interpretation which you supposed my last
   publication would admit of, so I feel much impatience to relieve both your
   anxiety and my own. My continuation of the piece will appear on Tuesday.

   I thank you for communicating your apprehensions to me; it will make me
   more explicit on the Subject, for my deign was and is to place the merit
   of these supplies where I think the merit is most due, that is in the
   disposition of the french nation to help us, "in the time of our greatest
   wants" these were the words I used in the papers of to day. And my full
   opinion is, that whether M Deane had been there or not, those Supplies
   would have found their way to America &mdash; Yet I mean not to deprive him of
   what Share may be his due, tho I cannot believe it to be very great.

   It is my wish it is my earnest desire to lead the people of America to
   see the friendship of the french nation in the light they ought to see it;
   they have deserved much from us of friendship and equal benevolence &mdash; And I
   think I am justified in saying, which is I believe the truth, and on honour
   which france is justly intitled to, that had America not succeeded, the
   supplies would have generously submitted to the loss.

   I am under no obligation to Congress otherwise than the honour they did me
   in the apointment. It is in every other light a disadvantage to me &mdash; I
   serve from principle. No member of Congress knows what I write till it
   appears in public, and this being the plan I go upon, I request for the
   Sake of the union which has so happily taken place that you will not
   misapprehend my design.

   I am Dear Sir Your Obt humble servt

   Signed Ths Paine.

   P. S. An anxiety to give you notice when my next would appear is the cause
   of my writing this.
   
   Response, de M Gerard. (Copied by Paine onto this copy.)
   
   Philadelphia January 2d. 1779.
   
   Sir
   
   The attention which you show to me in giving me notice of the time of the publication which shall take place to morrow 
   requires my thanks, and I deliver them to you with pleasure and confidence.
   
   I am fully persuaded that you will remember that all what I had the honor to say to you has no reference to any person 
   and that I have care but for the direct honor and interest of my Court and that my desire is rather that all 
   personal reference should be avoided as far as it could start questions which which would be desirable, should be 
   avoided; but the sentiment you profess leave no occasion to fear about this delicate object that commands my most 
   serious concern.
   
   I am with great regards.
   
   Je soupigne certifie les copies ci depris veritables et conformes aux Originaux. A Philadelphia le 15 Octobre 1779. 
   Gerard.
