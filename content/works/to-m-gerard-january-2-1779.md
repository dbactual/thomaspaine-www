   To M. Gerard  January 2, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   DEAR SIR :

   As I feel much concern at the interpretation which you supposed my last
   publication would admit of, so I feel much impatience to relieve both your
   anxiety and my own. My continuation of the piece will appear on Tuesday.

   I thank you for communicating your apprehension to me; it will make me
   more explicit on the subject, for my deign was and is to place the merit
   of these supplies where I think the merit is most due, that is in the
   disposition of the French nation to help us, "in the time of our greatest
   wants." These were the words I used in the papers of today, and my full
   opinion is, that whether Mr. Deane had been there or not, those supplies
   would have found their way to America. Yet I mean not to deprive him of
   what share may be his duo, though I cannot believe it to be very great.

   It is my wish, it is my earnest desire to lead the people of America to
   see the friendship of the French nation in the light they ought to see it;
   they have deserved much from us of friendship and equal benevolence, and I
   think I am justified in saying, which is I believe the truth, and on honor
   which France is justly entitled to, that had America not succeeded the
   supplies would have generously submitted to the loss.

   I am under no obligation to Congress otherwise than the honor they did me
   in the appointment. It is in every other light a disadvantage to me. I
   serve from principle. No member of Congress knows what I write till it
   appears in public, and this being the plan I go upon, I request for the
   sake of the union which has so happily taken place that you will not
   misapprehend my design.

   I am Dear Sir Your obedient humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. An anxiety to give you notice when my next would appear is the cause
   of my writing this.
