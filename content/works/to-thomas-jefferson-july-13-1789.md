   To Thomas Jefferson  July 13, [1789]

   ROTHERHAM, YORKSHIRE,

   DEAR SIR:

   I have not yet received my answer to my two last, the one by Messrs Parker
   & Cutting, the other by Post with the particulars of Ledyard's death from
   Sir Joseph Banks and Mr. Bailey.

   The Messrs Walkers and I have agreed on a plan and terms for executing and
   erecting a complete bridge which we hope to finish by October 20. Several
   bridges are wanted by as every one waits for some one to begin, we have
   resolved to begin ourselves. Our plan and terms are as follows. The arch
   is to be 110 feet span versed sine or arrow 5 feet and to consist of five
   ribs at least. The Walkers are to find all the materials, and fit and
   frame them ready for erecting, put them on board a vessel and send them to
   London. I am to undertake all expense from that time and to complete the
   erecting. We intend first to exhibit it and afterwards put it up to sale,
   or dispose of it by private contract, and after paying the expenses of
   each party the remainder to be equally divided-one half theirs, the other
   mine. My principal object in this plan is to open the way for a Bridge
   over the Thames, which will be more readily accomplished by erecting the
   Bridge at London than in any other part. When I proposed the before
   mentioned terms (by letter) to the Walkers, I asked, if it would be
   agreeable to them to take in one or two other Iron Works with us. They
   answered-"As our Works are large and capable of dispatching a considerable
   Bridge in a short space of time we would not choose to be concerned with
   any other Iron Works in this undertaking."

   I shall now have occasion to draw upon some funds I have in America. I
   have one thousand dollars stock in the Bank of Philadelphia, and two years
   interest due upon it last April, -L-180 in the hands of General Morris;
   -L-40 with Mr. Constable of New York; a house at Bordentown, and a farm at
   New Rochelle. The stock and interest in the Bank, which Mr. Willing
   manages for me, is the easiest negotiated, and full sufficient for what I
   shall want. On this fund I have drawn fifteen guineas payable to Mr.
   Trumbull, though I shall not want the money longer than till the
   Exhibition and sale of the Bridge. I had rather draw than ask to borrow of
   anybody here. If you go to America this year, I shall be very glad if you
   can arrange this matter for me, by giving me credit for two hundred
   pounds, on London, and receiving that amount of Mr. Willing. I am not
   acquainted with the method of negotiating money matter, but if you can
   accommodate me in this, and will direct me how the transfer is to be made
   I shall be much obliged to you.

   I am, dear sir, your obedient and humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P.S. Please direct to me under cover to Mr. Trumbull. I have some thoughts
   of coming over to France for two or three weeks, as I shall have little to
   do here until the Bridge is ready for erecting.
