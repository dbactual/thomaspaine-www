   ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   At the same time that British royalty was persecuting Paine for having
   dared to expose the inequalities in English society as well as for his
   fervent defense of the French Revolution, the French nation hailed him as
   their champion and claimed him for herself. On August 26, 1792, the French
   National Assembly voted the title of citizen to Paine, and during the
   first week of September he was elected to represent Calais, Oise, Somme,
   and Puy de Dome in the National Assembly. The following Address, in
   acknowledgment of the honor of being made a citizen of France, was written
   by Paine on September 25, 1792.

   ***

    

   FELLOW CITIZENS, I receive, with affectionate gratitude, the honor which
   the late National Assembly has conferred upon me, by adopting me a citizen
   of France: and the additional honor of being elected by my fellow citizens
   a member of the National Convention. Happily impressed, as I am, by those
   testimonies of respect shown toward me as an individual, I feel my
   felicity increased by seeing the barrier broken down that divided
   patriotism by spots of earth, and limited citizenship to the soil, like
   vegetation. Had those honors been conferred in an hour of national
   tranquility, they would have afforded no other means of showing my
   affection, than to have accepted and enjoyed them; but they come
   accompanied with circumstances that give me the honorable opportunity of
   commencing my citizenship in the stormy hour of difficulties. I come not
   to enjoy repose. Convinced that the cause of France is the cause of all
   mankind, and that liberty cannot be purchased by a wish, I gladly share
   with you the dangers and honors necessary to success.

   I am well aware that the moment of any great change, such as that
   accomplished on the tenth of August1, is unavoidably the moment of terror
   and confusion. The mind, highly agitated by hope, suspicion and
   apprehension, continues without rest till the change be accomplished. But
   let us now look calmly and confidently forward, and success is certain. It
   is no longer the paltry cause of kings, or of this, or of that individual,
   that calls France and her armies into action. It is the great cause of
   ALL. It is the establishment of a new era, that shall blot despotism from
   the earth, and fix, on the lasting principles of peace and citizenship,
   the great Republic of Man.

   It has been my fate to have borne a share in the commencement and complete
   establishment of one revolution (I mean the Revolution of America). The
   success and events of that revolution are encouraging to us. The
   prosperity and happiness that have since flowed to that country, have
   amply rewarded her for all the hardships she endured and for all the
   dangers she encountered.

   The principles on which that Revolution began, have extended themselves to
   Europe; and an overruling Providence is regenerating the old world by the
   principles of the new. The distance of America from all the other parts of
   the globe, did not admit of her carrying those principles beyond her own
   situation. It is to the peculiar honor of France, that she now raises the
   standard of liberty for all nations; and in fighting her own battles,
   contends for the rights of all mankind.

   The same spirit of fortitude that insured success to America will insure
   it to France, for it is impossible to conquer a nation determined to be
   free! The military circumstances that now unite themselves to France are
   such as the despots of the earth know nothing of, and can form no
   calculation upon. They know not what it is to fight against a nation; they
   have only been accustomed to make war upon each other, and they know, from
   system and practise, how to calculate the probable success of despot
   against despot; and here their knowledge and their experience end.

   But in a contest like the present a new and boundless variety of
   circumstances arise, that derange all such customary calculations. When a
   whole nation acts as an army, the despot knows not the extent of the power
   against which he contends. New armies arise against him with the necessity
   of the moment. It is then that the difficulties of an invading enemy
   multiply, as in the former case they diminished; and he finds them at
   their height when he expected them to end.

   The only war that has any similarity of circumstances with the present, is
   the late Revolution War in America. On her part, as it now is in France,
   it was a war of the whole nation:-there it was that the enemy, by
   beginning to conquer, put himself in a condition of being conquered. His
   first victories prepared him for defeat. He advanced till he could not
   retreat, and found himself in the midst of a nation of armies.

   Were it now to be proposed to the Austrians and Prussians, to escort them
   into the middle of France, and there leave them to make the most of such a
   situation, they would see too much into the dangers of it to accept the
   offer, and the same dangers would attend them, could they arrive there by
   any other means. Where, then, is the military policy of their attempting
   to obtain, by force, that which they would refuse by choice? But to reason
   with despots is throwing reason away. The best of arguments is a vigorous
   preparation.

   Man is ever a stranger to the ways by which Providence regulates the order
   of things. The interference of foreign despots may serve to introduce into
   their own enslaved countries the principles they come to oppose. Liberty
   and equality are blessings too great to be the inheritance of France
   alone. It is an honor to her to be their first champion; and she may now
   say to her enemies, with a mighty voice, "O! ye Austrians, ye Prussians!
   ye who now turn your bayonets against us, it is for you, it is for all
   Europe, it is for all mankind, and not for France alone, that she raises
   the standard of Liberty and Equality!"

   The public cause has hitherto suffered from the contradictions contained
   in the Constitution of the Constituent Assembly. Those contradictions have
   served to divide the opinions of individuals at home, and to obscure the
   great principles of the Revolution in other countries. But when those
   contradictions shall be removed, and the Constitution be made conformable
   to the Declaration of Rights; when the bagatelles of monarchy, royalty,
   regency and hereditary succession, shall be exposed, with all their
   absurdities, a new ray of light will be thrown over the world, and the
   Revolution will derive new strength by being universally understood.

   The scene that now opens itself to France extends far beyond the
   boundaries of her own dominions. Every nation is becoming her colleague,
   and every court is become her enemy. It is now the cause of all nations,
   against the cause of all courts. The terror that despotism felt,
   clandestinely begot a confederation of despots; and their attack upon
   France was produced by their fears at home.

   In entering on this great scene, greater than any nation has yet been
   called to act in let us say to the agitated mind, be calm. Let us punish
   by instructing, rather than by revenge. Let us begin the new era by a
   greatness of friendship, and hail the approach of union and success.

   Your fellow-citizen,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   1. Paine is referring to the fact that on August 10, 1792 the
   Revolutionary Commune of Paris invaded the Tuileries and made the King
   prisoner.
