   ANSWER TO FOUR QUESTIONS ON THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE POWERS

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   It is impossible to determine the exact date of the composition of this
   document, but it is very likely that it was started in the spring of 1791
   and completed some time during the following summer. It was later
   translated by Condorcet and published in the Chronique du Mois for June
   and July, 1792. The questions to which Paine replies were probably put to
   him by Condorcet, and related to the Constitution submitted by the French
   National Assembly.

   ***



   THE four questions to which you do me the honor of requesting an answer
   have been sent to me in a letter by my friend M__ Laying aside the usual
   complimentary preliminaries, I purpose replying to them at once: for a man
   who regards the whole human race as his own family has little time for
   compliments or excuses.

   It is obvious that the person who has laid these four propositions before
   Thomas Paine has done so with the expectation, or, at least, with the
   hope, that they may receive an affirmative reply. Indeed, this conclusion
   is easily gathered from the language he uses, which clearly implies that
   that austere Republican must give an affirmative reply if he is to hope
   for that grateful approval which is merited by every task that helps along
   the progress of human freedom.

   Well, then, I, too, can truly assert that I am keenly interested in the
   felicity of humanity among all peoples and in all lands, and, therefore,
   as a fraternal and sympathetic worker, associated with you and with
   everyone who holds similar opinions, I will, with all possible brevity,
   reply to your questions, and also submit certain considerations which they
   have prompted. In the meantime, however, you must not for a moment imagine
   that I have any intention of discussing the agreement or non-agreement of
   our opinions in all cases; but, as we are both aiming at the same goal, I
   shall confine myself to the task of simply discussing with you the best
   means of reaching that goal.

   After acknowledging that the foundation upon which the French Constitution
   rests is excellent, you point out its deficiencies in many particulars,
   and then you demand:

   1. As there is a want of equilibrium between the legislative and executive
   powers, is not the latter exposed to the danger of being overbalanced by
   the former?

   2. Is not the executive power too feeble to be able to force the people to
   obey the law and also too feeble to obtain the respect and confidence
   necessary to a stable government?

   3. Is not a legislative body composed of a single chamber likely to be the
   victim of its own rash impulsiveness and unrestrained impetuosity ?

   4. Is not the administrative system organized in such an intricate fashion
   as to lead to anarchy of a permanent character?

   I shall first consider these questions individually, and afterwards deal
   with them collectively. On the other hand, while I do not care to enter at
   present into any debate as to their supposed amelioration or curtailment,
   I intend to bring to your notice a scheme for their modification in such a
   way as not to interfere with the orderly course of government, should such
   modification be deemed essential.

   As to your assertion that the foundation upon which the French
   Constitution rests is excellent, there can be no difference of opinion
   between us, for as that foundation is the rights of man, the principle is
   too obvious to admit of argument. The man who should venture to gainsay it
   would thereby establish his kinship to the fool who said in his heart
   there is no God.

   FIRST QUESTION

   "As there is a want of equilibrium between the legislative and executive
   powers, is not the latter exposed to the danger of being overbalanced by
   the former?"

   If the legislative and executive powers be regarded as springing from the
   same source, the nation, and as having as their object the nation's weal
   by such a distribution of its authority, it will be difficult to foresee
   any contingency in which one power could derive advantage from
   overbalancing the other, even if it were successful in doing so. If, on
   the other hand, these two powers be considered as not springing from the
   same source, and as, in fact, mutually hostile, the one contending for the
   rights of the nation, the other for the privileges of a class, then surely
   your question assumes an entirely different aspect: in that case, what we
   should have to dread would not be the imminence of a single calamity, but
   the ruin of the entire people.

   It is impossible to judge from your words which of these views you adopt,
   and, in any case it would be far from easy to solve a problem whose
   solution depends on another problem, and, for that reason, I shall avail
   myself fully of the freedom which the indefinite nature of your question
   permits and shall make such observations as may naturally occur to me.
   Thus, while I may not solve the problem, I shall offer some suggestions
   which, perhaps, will conduce to its solution.

   The baleful custom of misgovernment is so universal and the con- sequent
   sufferings of nations throughout the centuries have been so dreadful that
   the soul of man, helpless and blinded, has almost lost the faculty of
   vision; the result is that even at the present day his power of drawing a
   distinction between prismatic shades can hardly be said to be fully
   developed.

   When we begin to use only such words as are fitted to express ideas simply
   and naturally, we see plainly that the powers of which governments are
   composed fall into two primary divisions: the law-making power and the
   executive or administrative power. There is nothing in government which
   really transcends these divisions.

   There is, I fancy, a more exact comprehension among people generally of
   the character of legislative power than there is of that of executive
   power. By the former is understood the delegated power of enacting laws
   that are consistent with the foundation and principles of the
   constitution. Otherwise, the legislative power would be pure despotism,
   call it by what name you will.

   But the meaning ordinarily assigned to the term, executive power, is
   indefinite, and, consequently, our conception of it is by no means so
   exact and plain as when we speak of legislative power. It is associated,
   some way or other, in our minds with the idea of arbitrary power, and thus
   a feeling of suspicion rather than of confidence is aroused. You see,
   then, the absolute necessity of an exact definition of these two powers
   and the difficulty of dealing with the questions they involve in the
   absence of such definition.

   Now, if we suppose it possible for one of these powers to encroach on the
   province of the other, then, of course, we must also suppose that the
   ability to do so is as great on one side as on the other. In that case, it
   is my opinion that the nation will be safer when an elected legislature
   controls the executive than when a non-elected executive attempts to usurp
   the function of legislation.

   But, putting aside these considerations, I confess my inability to
   perceive the correctness of the comparison of a government to a pair of
   scales. In what does it consist? The idea which a pair of scales calls up
   is that of opposition. The metaphor, I imagine, originated in England at a
   period when, owing to certain circumstances, it had a certain fitness.
   After the Norman Conquest, that nation, despairing of ridding itself of
   its oppressors, devoted itself for centuries to the task of rending a sort
   of counterpoise against their tyranny. For, with the advent of that
   conquest, arrived aristocracy, and the calamities with which the people
   had to contend were innumerable. Hence the nation threw its whole weight
   in the balance against royalty and aristocracy. This afterwards came to be
   called the balance of the nation poised against the balance of the court.

   In a country, however, in which all the powers of the government spring
   from the same source, such a metaphor has no meaning. In such
   circumstances we cannot even conceive the possibility of two hostile
   governmental forces in opposition; instead of such a conception, there
   looms up before us one single edifice in which all is united and
   harmonious.

   SECOND QUESTION

   And now I come to the second question: "Is not the executive power too
   feeble to be able to force the people to obey the laws, and also too
   feeble to obtain the respect and confidence necessary to a stable
   government?"

   If a first proposition is fundamentally wrong, all the propositions
   dependent on it must necessarily be also fallacious. In this connection,
   therefore, the question that naturally suggests itself is: What is meant
   by executive power? Should the answer be: the power of enforcing the laws,
   then the phrase relates to every court of justice bound to carry out the
   laws whenever their enforcement is resisted. It must always be the special
   object of the legislature to defend the executive under this aspect; for
   if respect for the law is enfeebled, the laws and those who enacted them
   will also be treated with contempt. Should, however, the opinion prevail
   that the executive has not power to compel obedience to the laws and that
   it cannot win respect and submission from the people, another question
   arises: Why has it been unable to do so?

   Such a question involves the consideration of the executive power under
   another aspect, namely as the medium through which the laws are executed
   rather than as the executor. When the subject is regarded from this point
   of view, we are forced to dwell on that part of the Constitution styled
   the monarchy.

   The primary significance of the term "monarch" implies the absolute power
   of a single individual. In fact the word is capable of no other
   interpretation. However sublime the principles of the Constitution may be,
   we must perceive here an evident contradiction between words and ideas.
   Now, such a contradiction always gives rise to suspicion, and, therefore,
   it will be well to consider how far such suspicion tends to hinder the
   proper execution of the laws.

   Should the recollection of the characteristics of the power of monarchy in
   the past, and the ideas which that recollection suggests, be in any way
   connected with the present executive, all plans intended to invigorate the
   latter will serve only to augment suspicion and diminish confidence.

   If it were a law of nature, or if God had issued a decree and revealed it
   to mankind, that, in accordance with His will, every successive custodian
   of authority should possess the same heart, a heart, too, incapable of
   guile, all suspicion and dread would vanish at once. But when we perceive
   that, from the mode in which nature acts, it is her apparent intention to
   reject the monarchical system, inasmuch as the monarchs on whom she
   bestows existence are sure to differ from one another both in person and
   disposition, one being wicked, another stupid, another insane, and another
   at once wicked, stupid and insane, it must surely be impossible for any
   reasonable person to believe any longer in such an absurdity as hereditary
   monarchy.

   Should the French be as impervious to common sense as the English have
   been, such drowsy unconcern might be regarded as a state of felicity, and
   their thoughtlessness might be considered confidence; but confidence, to
   be permanent, must be based on reason.

   THIRD QUESTION

   We have now reached the third question: "Is not a legislative body
   composed of a single chamber likely to be the victim of its own rash
   impulsiveness and unrestrained impetuosity?"

   This question can scarcely receive a positive answer at present because of
   its complexity and of the questions involved in its discussion. Still, I
   shall endeavor to communicate to you the thoughts that it suggests.

   When a constitution determines the limitations of authority and the
   principle to which the legislative body must yield obedience, it has
   already secured a most potent and effective check upon all abuses of
   authority.

   Suppose, for example, a bill were introduced in one of the American
   legislatures, like the one which became law in an English Parliament under
   George I, lengthening the duration of that legislature, it never could be
   enacted as a law, because such a law would be a violation of the
   Constitution, which limits the power of the legislature.

   Still, notwithstanding the limitations that restrain power in its several
   departments provided by the Constitution, much will always depend on the
   wisdom and discretion exhibited by the various legislatures themselves.

   However skillfully a constitution may be framed, it is impossible to
   decide previously, when there are two chambers, how far they will act as a
   check upon each other. They may come to an agreement not to avail
   themselves of this power of mutual restraint, either for good or evil;
   still, if the Constitution makes provision for such restraint, the result
   is sure to be advantageous.

   In my opinion, for which I shall adduce reasons, it would be well to
   separate the legislature into two bodies before the discussion of any
   subject commences. Such an arrangement is preferable to the formation of
   one body always, or to the establishment of two divided chambers.

   With reference to the sort of separation suggested, more consideration
   should be given to human passions than even to reason. Because the object
   is conviction or persuasion, the influence exercised by such passions is
   of considerable importance, and a legislature composed of a single chamber
   is always exposed to the peril of deciding with precipitation; when it is
   divided, there will always be room for judicious reflection. The utility
   of discussion is obvious, and occasionally a man of superior attainments
   will derive profit from the ideas of a person who is his inferior
   intellectually; if it be his purpose to put in practise some of the ideas
   to which he has listened, he should, as far as possible, avoid speaking
   himself.

   My plan would be to divide a legislature, consisting, say, of a hundred
   representatives, into two equal sections. The first section would discuss
   some question, while the second section listened. Then the second section
   would take up the same question. Then, after each section had heard the
   arguments of the other, the debate would be closed, and the subject
   finally submitted to the decision of the entire legislature. At least,
   some plan should, in my judgment, be adopted that would obviate the
   inconveniences which at present hamper the proceedings of a single
   chamber, and that would yet not entail the evils inherent in the existence
   of two chambers. Some of those evils I now propose to lay before you.

   First, it is contrary to common sense for one part of the legislature to
   have it in its power to decide a question while that question is being
   debated in another body, and while fresh light is being thrown on the
   discussion.

   In the second place, it often occurs that when a question is voted on in
   these separate chambers, the majority is controlled by the minority in a
   manner that is as repulsive as it is absurd.

   Let it be assumed, for example, that each of the chambers has 50 members.
   Now we can easily imagine a case in which the members of one assembly are
   unanimous, while those of the other are divided on the question in the
   proportion of 26 to 24. Here we have 26 outweighing 74, or, in other
   words, three-fourths of the legislators compelled to submit to one-fourth.

   On the other hand, if the legislature be divided in the way I have
   suggested, you gain all the advantages derived from separate debate
   without the evils which accompany the establishment of two chambers.

   The two chambers which form the English Parliament need not be discussed
   here. As legislative bodies, they have no really distinctive individual
   character. Their ideas are entirely molded and colored by those of the
   Prime Minister in power. He waves over them his sleep- compelling wand,
   and they are at once plunged in the slumber of servitude.

   Should we turn our eyes on the members of one of those chambers, profanely
   styled the House of Lords,( Lord means master.-Author.) a designation that
   insults nature, we discover that nature has avenged herself by bereaving
   them of talent and virtue. The entire representation of England is indeed
   calculated to arouse compassion; still, when contrasted with the Lords,
   the Commons are comparatively respectable. So slight is the regard paid to
   that childish body that the people never make any inquiries as to its
   proceedings.

   As an instance of its subjection to ministerial influence, I will mention
   that it gave the minister a majority of 90 after the debate on the war
   with Russia, whereas the House of Commons, which has double its number,
   gave him a majority of only. It has been well styled by Chesterfield, one
   of its members who was thoroughly acquainted with its composition, "the
   hospital for incurables."

   I am not at all in favor of two chambers which have each an arbitrary veto
   on the action of the other. There is nothing to prove that one body will
   exhibit more sagacity than the other, and to confide power to a body that
   lacks wisdom is to incur a peril rather than to provide a safe- guard. As
   all human institutions have grown better with the progress of time, we
   have every reason to believe that with time also the representative system
   will grow better. This belief is strengthened by the fact that, just as it
   has encountered the greatest opposition, so it stands the best chance of
   at last attaining perfection.

   FOURTH QUESTION

   We have now reached the fourth question: "Is not the administrative system
   organized in such an intricate fashion as to lead to anarchy of a
   permanent character?"

   There has been great progress in the science of government, and
   particularly where the state has a wide extension. This consists in
   allowing the several parts of a country to manage its own domestic
   affairs. In this fashion not only can public and private affairs be
   carried on with greater ease, but the loss of time and the expense
   incident to centralization are avoided, as well as the errors entailed by
   such a legislative system.

   From a general standpoint, I think the usefulness of the institution to
   which I have alluded is unquestionable; still, I must confess that I have
   not any special knowledge of its work in practise, for it has always been
   my object to endeavor to throw light upon general principles rather than
   on their application to particular cases; because if the former be sound,
   the latter will be sound also. But, as the science of government is so far
   only in its childhood, I can but hope that, whatever system may be
   adopted, it will permit us to take advantage of the lessons of experience.

   Although much study has been devoted to the science of government in all
   its manifestations, one subject closely connected with it has never
   received the full consideration it deserves; namely, how small is the
   measure of government that is actually required by man?

   This question is fully discussed in a work I am now writing; and,
   moreover, to deal adequately with it at present would transcend my limits.

   But I am strongly inclined to believe that very little government is
   necessary, and that the need of government above measure is one of those
   ideas from which it would be well to free ourselves as early as possible.

   When I inquire of a person how much government does he require, the answer
   I get is that he requires very little. But let me ask the same individual
   what amount of government he judges to be required by others, and he
   replies: "Oh, a very large amount, indeed!" If I continue my inquiries, I
   receive pretty much the same answers, and so I infer that the amount
   actually needed lies between these two extremes: the lesser amount each
   considers required for himself and the larger amount he regards as needful
   for his neighbor. Government beyond measure has the effect of giving
   encouragement and birth to crimes that otherwise might never have come
   into being.

   The governments of the past managed to stimulate enmity and suspicion in
   every direction between nations as well as between individuals, and in
   this fashion to perpetuate their miserable domination. The success of such
   a system is calculated to uproot the very foundations of society, and we
   still feel the effects of its corrupt putrescence. It follows that the
   moral nature of man must inevitably change, and that, when he is subjected
   to sounder principles of government, he will no longer be the suspicious
   creature he could not help being under the old systems. Now that nations
   seem to incline more and more toward the principles of civilized
   government, they would appear also to have gained the possession of a new
   faculty.

   The relations between the French and English nations have assumed quite a
   different character during the last couple of years, and we may hopefully
   look forward to a similar change between the individuals of these two
   nations. Still, the moral changes that affect nations or individuals
   produce their consequences far more rapidly when their tendency is evil
   than when it is beneficial. Suspicion may be spread without any trouble;
   it cannot be uprooted with anything like the same facility. If you try to
   eradicate it forcibly, you fail; but if you succeed in quietly undermining
   it, it will gradually pass away silently and noiselessly.

   When we contemplate the condition of France under the old regime, we
   behold a government that depends for its existence upon suspicion, upon
   spies and detectives employed by the police authorities. There could be no
   confidence in social circles, where everyone was in the habit of
   suspecting his neighbors; the master was suspicious of his servants,
   neighbors of one another, the Government of everyone, and everyone of the
   Government. It is natural, then, that the present Government should also
   be suspected. This suspicion is a relic from the past, a past which it
   would be fortunate if the nation could forget altogether.

   I shall now treat of the best methods for the improvement of the
   Constitution, whenever experience shows the necessity of such improvement,
   without disturbing the orderly course of government. The best method would
   be to add a clause to the Constitution determining the manner of such
   improvements. There are very different ideas upon this subject, and, for
   that reason, I propose discussing it in a special fashion. Until the
   present moment, France has had no constitution; she is now about to form
   one and to choose a legislature. In these circumstances it is absolutely
   indispensable to draw a distinction between the position of the people in
   the act of delegating its power to those who will establish a
   constitution, and its subsequent position after delegating its power to a
   legislature elected in virtue of that constitution. Now, the Constitution
   and the laws are altogether different from the power of enacting laws to
   suit particular contingencies, conformable to the principles of the
   aforesaid Constitution. If the original power to establish a constitution
   were vested in successive legislatures as a hereditary possession, a
   constitution could have no real existence; the legislature would be
   endowed with despotic authority, and could, as in England, establish
   whatever kind of government it chose.

   The present National Assembly, or, to be strictly accurate, the National
   Assembly of the Convention, has been compelled by circumstances to
   undertake legislative functions at the very time it was establishing a
   constitution. Thus, owing to the enormous amount of business it had to
   transact in uprooting some institutions, and constructing others, and
   making provision for absolute necessities, its attention was being
   constantly distracted. Apart from the particular business to which its
   energies were devoted, its work in the establishment of a constitution
   embraces two special objects: the one destructive, the other constructive.
   In regard to the first point it could not err: the ancient structure was
   based on an evil principle; in other words, on usurpation.

   Having reduced the subject to its elements, I shall now consider the
   second question, which relates to construction.

   The sound basis upon which the new edifice is founded fully compensates
   the nation for all it has endured. But have the builders of the new
   edifice been too frugal or too liberal in the use they have made of the
   old materials ? Are all its part equally symmetrical? Has experience
   proved that it is less or more symmetrical than was needful ?

   These are questions which experience alone can answer. All that wisdom can
   do at present is to see that no future improvement shall be obstructed.

   However, there are two subjects upon which everyone has the same opinion:
   the boldness of the enterprise and the perseverance that has marked its
   achievement. It was to be expected that passionate ardor and the dread of
   falling back under bad government should have led the framers of the
   Constitution to be content with a relative excellence in their fear of
   retrogression. In view of the fact, however, that a final settlement
   precludes amelioration, this determination would seem of rather dubious
   value. Political questions are being so vastly illumined by the light of
   reason that the dread of man ever again plunging back into the foul night
   of ignorance is a dread which should be energetically discarded.

   In every land throughout the universe the tendency of the interest of the
   greatest number is in the direction of good rather than of evil, and the
   inevitable result must be to elevate the science of government to a height
   of perfection of which we have now no conception. To fetter ourselves
   would be folly; to fetter posterity would be usurpation; we must do
   nothing that impedes progress. If man had any rights over posterity, our
   rights would have been ruined long ago. If, instead of regarding the
   future, we turn our eyes on the past, we see clearly that we should have
   been reduced to a very low condition indeed, if our ancestors had
   succeeded in laying that yoke upon our shoulders which we would fain lay
   upon our posterity. Had they done so, we should never have accomplished
   what we are now engaged in accomplishing. The enjoyment of his rights does
   not suffice for man; he should also be secured in their exercise by the
   principles of social order.

   If we wish to benefit our posterity politically, let us leave them liberty
   as a bequest, and, along with it, the encouragement of good example.
   Everything that deserves imitation is sure to be imitated. If our
   institutions are intrinsically admirable, posterity will assimilate them,
   and there will be no necessity for us to try to exercise our authority
   over our descendants.

   When an inheritance is bequeathed, it never contains a clause enjoining
   its acceptance on the heirs, for such a clause would be altogether
   ineffective. The heirs will accept it if they deem it worth accepting,
   reject it if they believe the contrary. The same is the case with regard
   to government. The rights of man belong as much to our descendants as they
   do to us. We should not, in our zeal for their prosperity, begin by
   slighting their abilities. Perhaps, their wisdom will be more profound
   than ours. It would be folly in us to assert a privilege to which we have

   not the slightest claim.

   The power of self-amendment forms a very marked feature of the
   Constitution. Very probably, no constitution could be established in which
   defects would not appear in the course of time. The best way of dealing
   with such defects is to provide a method of correcting them as they arise.
   No constitution which has not such a corrective can be permanent. The
   Convention which established the Pennsylvanian Constitution, in 1776,
   under the presidency of Benjamin Franklin, had a clause decreeing that the
   Constitution should be revised every seven years by a convention, and that
   such additions and retrenchments as public opinion demanded should be
   discussed. The amendments proposed were, however, to be laid before the
   people for a considerable period before they were voted upon. Another
   convention changed this clause into another, embodying the right of the
   nation to alter or perfect the Constitution whenever she should deem it
   necessary.

   I should prefer to such a general declaration as the above the exercise of
   power which would not weaken the absolute right, while, by its frequent
   use, it would compel the Government to avoid overstepping the principles
   of the Constitution.

   The Federal Government of the United States, established in 1787 by the
   Convention over which General Washington presided, has in its Constitution
   a clause that calls for every improvement needed in the future. But such
   improvement must be effected by the authority of the people and by the
   same agencies that established the Constitution. It is not enough to
   constitute a good government; it is equally indispensable to adopt such
   methods as may assure the permanency of a good government.

   Indeed, no constitution that does not make provision for this purpose can
   be considered complete. We are taught by experience that it is exceedingly
   hard to effect reforms, and, therefore, we benefit posterity when we adopt
   such contrivances now as will insure their success.

   Provided the general principles of a constitution are sound, it will
   always be so easy to achieve such lesser reforms as are required by
   experience that the nation will never be persuaded to permit abuses to be
   piled upon abuses. In my judgment, it would be well to begin the revision
   of the Constitution in seven years from the present date, for during that
   period sufficient time will be afforded to make the people acquainted with
   its faults and virtues. It is worthy of notice that a few of the most
   important articles of the Constitution are due to particular circumstances

   rather than to reflection.

   As an instance, I shall mention the decree concerning the right of peace
   and war. The two years which the Assembly spent in establishing the
   Constitution were assuredly not sufficiently long a period for the
   discussion of all the important subjects naturally connected with it. For
   this reason, the time for the first revision should not be put off too
   long, as we can easily see that certain additions and amendments will be
   absolutely needed. For that matter, it is by no means unlikely that before
   then all the European systems of government will experience a change, and
   that quarrels among nations will be terminated by pacific methods and not
   by the ferocious horrors of war.

   The revolution which is influencing governments at present from West to
   East is quicker in its effects than the movement which once spread from
   East to West. I fondly hope that the National Assembly may have the
   courage to call for a convention of the representatives of the various
   nations of Europe, which would adopt measures for the general welfare. The
   felicity which liberty insures us is transformed into virtue when we
   communicate its enjoyment to others.

   I-should have completed this letter, which I began five weeks ago, sooner
   but for a journey which I had to make. Since then, the progress of events
   in France has been rapid, because of the flight and arrest of Louis XVI.
   All these events stimulate the reasoning faculty. Man advances from idea
   to idea, from thought to thought, and all the time he is unaware of his
   marvelous progress. Those who fancy that the goal of its political
   knowledge has been attained by France will soon discover their mistake,
   and will be quickly outstripped unless they quicken their own paces. Not a
   day passes unaccompanied by a novelty. The human mind, long accustomed to
   struggle with kings as individuals, must now regard them as forming part
   of a system of government, and must conclude that monarchy is only a base
   political superstition which should not exist among an enlightened people.
   It is mental servitude that has rendered it sacred.

   Suppose we draw a circle around a man, and address him thus: "You cannot
   step beyond this boundary, for, if you did, you would be swallowed up in
   an abyss." As long as the terror with which these words have inspired him
   continues, he will stay where he is. But if, by some lucky accident, he
