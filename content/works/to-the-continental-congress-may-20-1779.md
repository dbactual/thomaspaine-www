   To the Continental Congress  May 20, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   Understanding that Mr. Deane has mentioned or alluded to me, in his
   narrative, and likewise to this Honorable [body], I request that I may be
   admitted to a per[usal] of the originals, or furnished copies of such
   parts of his narrative and letters as refer [to] me either by name or as
   the author of the Publication under the signature of Common Sense of which
   Publications [I] am the author. If the justice of complying with the
   application do not instantly appear, I request that it may be laid aside,
   as I would not wish to be even the accidental means of losing a moment's
   time.

   THOMAS PAINE.
