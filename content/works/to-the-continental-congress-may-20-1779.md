   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Philadelphia May 20th 1779

   Honble Sirs

   Understanding that Mr. Deane has mentioned or alluded to me, in his
   narrative, and likewise in several of his letters to this Honble (House), I request that I may be
   admitted to a per(usal) of the originals, or furnished with copies of such
   parts of his said narrative and letters as refer (to) me either by name or as
   the author of the Publication under the signature of Common Sense of which
   Publications (I) am the author. If the justice of complying with the
   application do not instantly appear, I request that it may be laid aside,
   as I would not wish to be even the accidental means of losing a moment's
   time.
   
   A am Honble Sirs your Honors Obt Humble Serv

   THOMAS PAINE
