   To Thomas Jefferson [October 1801]

   DEAR SIR:

   The ratification of the treaty at last gives me another opportunity of
   writing to you. The coalition of the North has vanished almost to nothing.
   There is no certain news from Egypt either in France or England. Admiral
   Gantheame has returned without being able to land in Egypt the
   reinforcement he took with him. He has taken the Swiftsure an English 74,
   and another 74 the Hanibal has been taken in the Bay of Algeciras; but
   afterwards two Spanish ships of the line attacked each other in the night
   by mistake and both perished. The general talk is now of the descent upon
   England, and the English Government has some alarms upon the case.
   Preparations for this ought to have been made last year immediately after
   signing the peace with Austria. In the Memoir I sent to B[arras] in answer
   to the question he sent to me at that time (a copy of which you have) I
   endeavored to press this point strongly upon him. Had the preparation been
   set about then neither the expedition of the English to the Baltic, nor to
   Egypt could have taken place. They could not have left their coast
   unfurnished, nor sent their best troops abroad as they have done. I
   believe the peace with Portugal is not ratified by France, but be it, or
   be it not, if France does not make preparations for a descent, I feel
   persuaded the English will send an expedition against the Portuguese
   settlements in S[outh] America. A thousand gun-boats proper for a descent
   would not cost more than four or five ships of the line would cost, and
   they would do. Boats do not require to be manned by sailors as ships do,
   and need no other kind of naval stores than are produced in France. The
   Secretary-General of Marines who speaks English asked me a few days ago,
   to give a Memoir on the descent which [he] himself would translate for the
   Minister, which I did. But from the short interview I had with the
   Minister he did not appear to me much disposed to promote a descent by
   Boats. He is a Naval architecht, and reckoned capital in his line, and I
   suppose would rather build ships than boats. I think the French Government
   would do well were it to divide the Marine office into two parts and
   separate the construction and direction of the boat-marine from that of
   ships. The boat-marine it is probable, would then be carried on with
   ambition and energy, which, I see, will not be the case while the two are
   blended together. If preparations for a descent go forward, it will of
   consequence hold England in check and alarm, perhaps more so than the
   coalition of the North did, and in that case she will be cautious how she
   conducts herself towards America.

   I have been observing for some days past the manner of finishing the
   outside of houses in Paris. They appear to be stone fronts, but are not
   so; and except some costly buildings the walls are built of rough stone
   and plastered or stuccoed. In America no plastered or stuccoed work will
   stand the breaking up of the frost. In Paris it stands perfectly, and I
   have seen some winters nearly as severe here as in America. The difference
   is in the material and not in the workmanship. In America the plaster or
   stucco is made of lime mortar. In Paris it is made of plaster of paris,
   which has not any quality of lime stone in it. I know not if you have
   observed it, but about a third of this stone in the natural state is water
   in a fixed state. When it is burnt, or rather roasted, about 10 or 12
   hours in a large heap, the watery part is expelled. It is then pounded,
   for it will not, after being burnt, dissolve in water like lime, nor
   produce any heat. It is then sifted, and mixed with water to about the
   thickness of whitewash which in a few minutes will become fixed. In this
   state, that is, before it becomes hard, it is plastered upon the rough
   stone and marked into squares resembling stone. It is then white washed
   with the same material sifted finer. I observe they throw the first
   coating on, after it is a little stiff, with the hand to make it adhere
   the better, and smooth it with the trowel. They begin at the top. The
   cornish is made of this plaster. They finish as they go. When they have
   plastered about four or five feet downward and before the plaster got
   hard, they draw the lines with a tool like a graver which cuts out the
   joints resembling stone. To make the lines straight they use a long rule,
   and they put the last washing on before the first coating is dry. These
   fronts resist wet and are not injured by frost, but bricks absorb a great
   quantity of wet. If a pint of water be thrown against a brick wall in a
   hot day scarcely any of it will reach the ground; and as to plastered
   fronts in America made of lime mortar they fall to pieces with the
   breaking up of the frost. There is plenty of this stone in Nova Scotia,
   and I think it would be a useful material in houses in America. Were I to
   build a brick house in America I would have the bricks made large and of
   the shape of the capital letter (drawing omitted). There would then be so
   many hollows from the top to the bottom of the wall that I question if the
   wet would get through. I know not why we follow the English statute
   measure of 9 inches by 4.

   The priests begin again to put up their heads, as you will see by the
   enclosed publication of the Minister of Police.

   T. P.
