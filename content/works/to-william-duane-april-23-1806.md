   To William Duane  April 23, 1806

   NEW ROCHELLE,

   MR. DUANE:

   I see by the English papers, that some conversations have lately taken
   place in parliament in England, on the subject of repealing the act that
   incorporated the members elected in Ireland with the parliament elected in
   England so as to form only one parliament.

   As England could not domineer Ireland more despotically than it did
   through the Irish parliament, people were generally at a loss (as well
   they might be) to discover any motive for that union, more especially as
   it was pushed with unceasing activity against all opposition. The
   following anecdote, which was known but to few persons, and to none, I
   believe in England except the former minister, will unveil the mystery:

   When Lord Malmsbury arrived in Paris, in the time of the directory
   government, to open a negotiation for a peace, his credentials ran in the
   old style of, "George, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France and
   Ireland, king." Malmsbury was informed that though the assumed title of
   king of France in his credentials would not prevent France opening a
   negotiation, yet that no treaty of peace could be concluded until that
   assumed title was renounced. Pitt then hit on the union bill under which
   the assumed title of king of France was discontinued.

   THOMAS PAINE.
