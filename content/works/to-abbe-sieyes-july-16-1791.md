   To Abbe Sieyes  July 16, 1791

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   In the same month, July, 1791, in which he wrote "A Republican Manifesto,"
   Paine published in the Republican, which he and Condorcet had founded, an
   attack on the monarchy. Abbe Sieyes, the spokesman of the French middle
   classes, who had framed a constitution in which the monarchy was retained,
   wrote a reply to Paine's article, arguing that "one is freer under a
   monarchy than under a republic." Paine expanded his attack on the monarchy
   in this letter to the Abbe which appeared in the Moniteur for July 16,
   1791.

   ***

   AT the moment of my departure from England, I read in the Moniteur of
   Tuesday last, your letter, in which you give the challenge, on the subject
   of government, and offer to defend what is called the monarchical opinion
   against the republican system.

   I accept of your challenge with pleasure; and I place such confidence in
   the superiority of the republican system over that nullity of a system,
   called monarchy, that I engage not to exceed the extent of fifty pages,
   and to leave you the liberty of taking as much latitude as you may think
   proper.

   The respect which I bear your moral and literary reputation, will be your
   security for my candor in the course of this discussion; but, not-
   withstanding that I shall treat the subject seriously and sincerely, let
   me promise, that I consider myself at liberty to ridicule, as they
   deserve, monarchical absurdities, whensoever the occasion shall present
   itself.

   By republicanism, I do not understand what the name signifies in Holland,
   and in some parts of Italy. I understand simply a government by
   representation-a government founded upon the principles of the Declaration
   of Rights; principles to which several parts of the French Constitution
   arise in contradiction. The Declaration of Rights of France and America
   are but one and the same thing in principles, and almost in expressions;
   and this is the republicanism which I undertake to defend against what is
   called monarchy and aristocracy.

   I see with pleasure, that in respect to one point we are already agreed;
   and that is, the extreme danger of a civil list of thirty millions. I can
   discover no reason why one of the parts of the government should be
   supported with so extravagant a profusion, while the other scarcely
   receives what is sufficient for its common wants.

   This dangerous and dishonorable disproportion at once supplies the one
   with the means of corrupting, and throws the other into the predicament of
   being corrupted. In America there is but little difference, with regard to
   this point, between the legislative and the executive part of our
   government; but the first is much better attended to than it is in France.
   ("A deputy to the Congress receives about a guinea and a half daily and
   provisions are cheaper in America than in France."-Author.)

   In whatsoever manner, Sir, I may treat the subject of which you have
   proposed the investigation, I hope that you will not doubt my entertaining
   for you the highest esteem. I must also add, that I am not the personal
   enemy of kings. Quite the contrary.

   No man more heartily wishes than myself to see them all in the happy and
   honorable state of private individuals; but I am the avowed, open, and
   intrepid enemy of what is called monarchy; and I am such by principles
   which nothing can either alter or corrupt-by my attachment to humanity; by
   the anxiety which I feel within myself, for the dignity and the honor of
   the human race; by the disgust which I experience, when I observe men
   directed by children, and governed by brutes; by the horror which all the
   evils that monarchy has spread over the earth excite within my breast; and
   by those sentiments which make me shudder at the calamities, the
   exactions, the wars, and the massacres with which monarchy has crushed
   mankind: in short, it is against all the hell of monarchy that I have
   declared war.

   THOMAS PAINE.
