   AND THE MEANS OF PREVENTING IT IN PLACES NOT YET INFECTED WITH IT

   ADDRESSED TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH IN AMERICA

   A GREAT deal has been written respecting the yellow fever. First, with
   respect to its causes, whether domestic or imported. Secondly, on the mode
   of treating it.

   What I am going to suggest in this essay is to ascertain some point to
   begin at, in order to arrive at the cause, and for this purpose some
   preliminary observations are necessary.

   The yellow fever always begins in the lowest part of a populous mercantile
   town near the water, and continues there, without affecting the higher
   parts. The sphere or circuit it acts in is small, and it rages most where
   large quantities of new ground have been made by banking out the river,
   for the purpose of making wharfs.

   The appearance and prevalence of the yellow fever in these places, being
   those where vessels arrive from the West Indies, has caused the belief
   that the yellow fever was imported from thence; but here are two cases
   acting in the same place: the one, the condition of the ground at the
   wharves, which being new made on the muddy and filthy bottom of the river,
   is different from the natural condition of the ground in the higher parts
   of the city, and consequently subject to produce a different kind of
   effluvia or vapor; the other case is the arrival of vessels from the West
   Indies.1

   In the State of Jersey neither of these cases has taken place; no shipping
   arrives there, and consequently there have been no embankments for the
   purpose of wharfs; and the yellow fever has never broken out in Jersey.
   This, however, does not decide the point as to the immediate cause of the
   fever, but it shows that this species of fever is not common to the
   country in its natural state2; and, I believe the same was the case in the
   West Indies before embankments began for the purpose of making wharfs,
   which always alter the natural condition of the ground. No old history,
   that I know of, mentions such a disorder as the yellow fever.

   A person seized with the yellow fever in an affected part of the town, and
   brought into the healthy part, or into the country, and among healthy
   persons, does not communicate it to the neighborhood, or to those
   immediately around him; why then are we to suppose it can be brought from
   the West Indies, a distance of more than a thousand miles, since we see it
   cannot be carried from one town to another, nor from one part of a town to
   another, at home? Is it in the air?3

   This question on the case requires a minute examination. In the first
   place, the difference between air and wind is the same as between a stream
   of water and a standing water. A stream of water is water in motion, and
   wind is air in motion. In a gentle breeze the whole body of air, as far as
   the breeze extends, moves at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour; in
   a high wind, at the rate of seventy, eighty or an hundred miles an hour:
   when we see the shadow of a cloud gliding on the surface of the ground we
   see the rate at which the air moves, and it must be a good trotting horse
   that can keep pace with the shadow, even in a gentle breeze; consequently,
   a body of air that is in and over any place of the same extent as the
   affected part of a city may be, will, in the space of an hour, even at the
   moderate rate I speak of, be moved seven or eight miles to leeward; and
   its place, in and over the city, will be supplied by a new body of air
   coming from a healthy part, seven or eight miles distant the contrary way;
   and then on in continual succession. The disorder, therefore, is not in
   the air, considered in its natural state, and never stationary. This leads
   to another consideration of the case.

   An impure effluvia, arising from some, cause in the ground, in the manner
   that fermenting liquors produce near their surface an effluvia that is
   fatal to life4, will become mixed with the air contiguous to it, and as
   fast as that body of air moves off it will impregnate every succeeding
   body of air, however pure it may be when it arrives at the place.

    The result from this state of the case is, that the impure air, or vapor,
   that generates the yellow fever, issues from the earth, that is, from the
   new made earth, or ground raised on the muddy and filthy bottom of the
   river; and which impregnates every fresh body of air that comes over the
   place, in like manner as air becomes heated when it approaches or passes
   over fire, or becomes offensive in smell when it approaches or passes over
   a body of corrupt vegetable or animal matter in a state of putrefaction.

   The muddy bottom of rivers contains great quantities of impure and often
   inflammable air (carbureted hydrogen gas), injurious to life; and which
   remains entangled in the mud till let loose from thence by some accident.5
   This air is produced by the dissolution and decomposition of any
   combustible matter falling into the water and sinking into the mud, of
   which the following circumstance will serve to give some explanation.

   In the fall of the year that New York was evacuated (1783), General
   Washington had his headquarters at Mrs. Berrian's, at Rocky Hill, in
   Jersey, and I was there; the Congress then sat at Prince Town [Princeton].
   We had several times been told that the river or creek that runs near the
   bottom of Rocky Hill, and over which there is a mill, might be set on
   fire, for that was the term the country people used; and as General
   Washington had a mind to try the experiment, General Lincoln, who was also
   there, undertook to make preparation for it against the next evening,
   November fifth. This was to be done, as we were told, by disturbing the
   mud at the bottom of the river, and holding something in a blaze, as paper
   or straw, a little above the surface of the water.

   Colonels Humphreys and Cobb were at that time aides-de-camp of General
   Washington, and those two gentlemen and myself got into an argument
   respecting the cause. Their opinion was that, on disturbing the bottom of
   the river, some bituminous matter arose to the surface, which took lire
   when the light was put to it; I, on the contrary, supposed that a quantity
   of inflammable air was let loose, which ascended through the water and
   took fire above the surface6. Each party held to his opinion, and the next
   evening the experiment was to be made.

   A scow had been stationed in the mill dam, and General Washington, General
   Lincoln and myself, and I believe Colonel Cobb (for Humphreys was sick),
   and three or four soldiers with poles, were put on board the scow. General
   Washington placed himself at one end of the scow and I at the other; each
   of us had a roll of cartridge paper, which we lighted and held over the
   water about two or three inches from the surface when the soldiers began
   disturbing the bottom of the river with the poles.

   As General Washington sat at one end of the scow and I at the other, I
   could see better anything that might happen from his light than I could
   from my own, over which I was nearly perpendicular. When the mud at the
   bottom was disturbed by the poles, the air bubbles rose fast, and I saw
   the fire take from General Washington's light and descend from thence to
   the surface of the water, in a similar manner as when a lighted candle is
   held so as to touch the smoke of a candle just blown out the smoke will
   take fire and the fire will descend and light up the candle. This was
   demonstrative evidence that what was called setting the river on fire was
   setting on fire the inflammable air that arose out of the mud.

   I mentioned this experiment to Mr. Rittenhouse of Philadelphia the next
   time I went to that city, and our opinion on the case was that the air or
   vapor that issued from any combustible matter (vegetable or otherwise),
   that underwent a dissolution and decomposition of its parts, either by
   fire or water in a confined place, so as not to blaze, would be
   inflammable and would become flame whenever it came in contact with flame.

   In order to determine if this was the case, we filled up the breech of a
   gun barrel about five or six inches with sawdust, and the proper part with
   dry sand to the top, and after spiking up the touch-hole, put the breech
   into a smith's furnace and kept it red hot, so as to consume the sawdust;
   the sand of consequence would prevent any blaze.

   We applied a lighted candle to the mouth of the barrel; as the first vapor
   that flew off would be humid, it extinguished the candle; but after
   applying the candle three or four times, the vapor that issued put began
   to flash; we then tied a bladder over the mouth of the barrel, which the
   vapor soon filled, and then tying a string round the neck of the
   bladder, above the muzzle, took the bladder off.

   As we could not conveniently make experiments upon the vapor while it was
   in the bladder, the next operation was to get it into a phial. For this
   purpose, we took a phial of about three or four ounces, filled it with
   water, put a cork slightly into it, and introducing it into the neck of
   the bladder, worked the cork out, by getting hold of it through the
   bladder, into which the water then emptied itself, and the air in the
   bladder ascended into the phial; we then put the cork into the phial, and
   took it from the bladder. It was now in a convenient condition for
   experiment.

   We put a lighted match into the phial, and the air or vapor in it blazed
   up in the manner of a chimney on fire; we extinguished it two or three
   times, by stopping the mouth of the phial; and putting the lighted match
   to it again it repeatedly took fire, till the vapor was spent, and the
   phial became filled with atmospheric air. These two experiments, that in
   which some combustible substance (branches and leaves of trees) had been
   decomposed by water, in the mud; and this, where the decomposition had
   been produced by fire, without blazing, shows that a species of air
   injurious to life, when taken into the lungs, may be generated from
   substances which, in themselves, are harmless.

   It is by means similar to these that charcoal, which is made by fire
   without blazing, emits a vapor destructive to life. I now come to apply
   these cases, and the reasoning deduced therefrom, to account for the cause
   of the yellow fever.7

   First.-The yellow fever is not a disorder produced by the climate
   naturally, or it would always have been here in the hot months. The
   climate is the same now as it was fifty or a hundred years ago; there was
   no yellow fever then, and it is only within the last twelve years, that
   such a disorder has been known in America.8

   Secondly.-The low grounds on the shores of the rivers, at the cities where
   the yellow fever is annually generated, and continues about three months
   without spreading, were not subject to that disorder in their natural
   state, or the Indians would have forsaken them; whereas, they were the
   parts most frequented by the Indians in all seasons of the year, on
   account of fishing. The result from these cases is that the yellow fever
   is produced by some new circumstance not common to the country in its
   natural state, and the question is what is that new circumstance?

   It may be said that everything done by the white people, since their
   settlement in the country, such as building towns, clearing lands,
   leveling hills, and filling valleys, is a new circumstance; but the yellow
   fever does not accompany any of these new circumstances. No alteration
   made on the dry land produces the yellow fever; we must therefore look to
   some other new circumstances, and we now come to those that have taken
   place between wet and dry, between land and water.

   The shores of the rivers at New York, and also at Philadelphia, have on
   account of the vast increase of commerce, and for the sake of making
   wharfs, undergone great and rapid alterations from their natural state
   within a few years; and it is only in such parts of the shores where those
   alterations have taken place that the yellow fever has been produced. The
   parts where little or no alteration has been made, either on the East or
   North River, and which continue in their natural state, or nearly so, do
   not produce the yellow fever. The fact therefore points to the cause.

   Besides several new streets gained from the river by embankment, there are
   upwards of eighty new wharfs made since the war, and the much greater part
   within the last ten or twelve years; the consequence of which has been
   that great quantities of filth or combustible matter deposited in the
   muddy bottom of the river contiguous to the shore, and which produced no
   ill effect while exposed to the air, and washed twice every twenty-four
   hours by the tide water, have been covered over several feet deep with new
   earth, and pent up, and the tide excluded. It is in these places, and in
   these only, that the yellow fever is produced.

   Having thus shown, from the circumstances of the case, that the cause of
   the yellow fever is in the place where it makes its appearance, or rather,
   in the pernicious vapor issuing therefrom, I go to show a method of
   constructing wharfs, where wharfs are yet to be constructed (as on the
   shore on the East River at Corlder's Hook, and also on the North River)
   that will not occasion the yellow fever, and which may also point out a
   method of removing it from places already infected with it.

   Instead, then, of embanking out the river and raising solid wharfs of
   earth on the mud bottom of the shore, the better method would be to
   construct wharfs on arches, built .of stone; the tide will then flow in
   under the arch, by which means the shore, and the muddy bottom, will be
   washed and kept clean, as if they were in their natural state, without
   wharfs.

   When wharfs are constructed on the shore lengthways, that is without
   cutting the shore up into slips, arches can easily be turned, because
   arches joining each other lengthways serve as butments to each other; but
   when the shore is cut up into slips there can be no butments; in this case
   wharfs can be formed on stone pillars, or wooden piles planked over on the
   top.

   In either of these cases, the space underneath will be commodious shelter
   or harbor for small boats, which can come in and go out always, except at
   low water, and be secure from storms and injuries. This method besides
   preventing the cause of the yellow fever, which I think it will, will
   render the wharfs more productive than the present method, because of the
   space preserved within the wharf.

   I offer no calculation of the expense of constructing wharfs on arches or
   piles; but on a general view, I believe they will not be so expensive as
   the present method. A very great part of the expense of making solid
   wharfs of earth is occasioned by the carriage of materials, which will be
   greatly reduced by the methods here proposed, and still more so were the
   arches to be constructed of cast iron blocks. I suppose that one ton of
   cast iron blocks would go as far in the construction of an arch as twenty
   tons of stone.

   If, by constructing wharfs in such a manner that the tide water can wash
   the shore and bottom of the river contiguous to the shore, as they are
   washed in their natural condition, the yellow fever can be prevented from
   generating in places where wharfs are yet to be constructed, it  may point
   out a method of removing it, at least by degrees, from places already
   infected with it; which will be by opening the wharfs in two or three
   places in each, and letting the tide water pass through; the parts opened
   can be planked over, so as not to prevent the use of the wharf.

   In taking up and treating this subject, I have considered it as belonging
   to natural philosophy, rather than medicinal art; and therefore I say
   nothing about the treatment of the disease after it takes place; I leave
   that part to those whose profession it is to study it.

   NEW YORK

   1.   Due to the heroic work of Walter Reed during and after the
   Spanish-American War, we now know that yellow fever is carried by a
   particular type of mosquito, the A'edes aegypti, prevalent in the West
   Indies, Central America and West Africa. The disease is practically
   unknown in Central America today because the mosquito has been destroyed.
   We now know that this mosquito carries the deadly virus of yellow fever.
   The "new wharves" Paine speaks of was the haven for ships from the West
   Indies, thus the coincidence. The deadly mosquito cannot live long in our
   climate, but does live long enough to bite people living near the
   wharves.-Editor.

   2.  Although New Jersey has mosquitoes they are not the kind that carry
   the yellow fever virus.-Editor.

   3. Yellow fever travels only where the mosquito can travel. Influenza,
   however, is communicated by people to each other.-Editor.

   4.  This is simply a coincidence of phenomena. We now know that decaying
   matter is not poisonous, but since flies and mosquitoes thrive on
   putrified matter and since they may carry diseases people in those days
   associated the putrified matter with disease. However, Paine cautiously
   points out that he does not know if the putrified matter itself is the
   disease carrier. (See note 7.)-Editor.

   5.  Marsh gas, "carbureted hydrogen gas," is inflammable. It is produced
   by decaying roots, weeds, etc. in marshes.-Editor.

   6. Paine was correct in saying that it was a gas that was
   inflammable.-Editor.

   7. The author does not mean to infer that the inflammable air or
   carbureted hydrogen gas, is the cause of the yellow fever; but that
   perhaps it enters into some combination with miasma generated in low
   grounds, which produces the disease.-Author

   8.  Such extensive trade with the West Indies had not taken place previous
   to the period during which the article was written.-Editor.
