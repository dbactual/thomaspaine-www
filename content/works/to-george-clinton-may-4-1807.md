   To George Clinton  May 4, 1807

   NEW YORK,

   RESPECTED FRIEND:

   Elisha Ward and three or four other Tories who lived within the British
   lines in the Revolutionary war, got in to be inspectors of the election
   last year at New Rochelle. Ward was supervisor. These men refused my vote
   at the election, saying to me: "You are not an American; our minister at
   Paris, Gouverneur Morris, would not reclaim you when you were imprisoned
   in the Luxembourg prison at Paris, and General Washington refused to do
   it." Upon my telling him that the two cases he stated were falsehoods, and
   that if he did me injustice I would prosecute him, he got up, and calling
   for a constable, said to me, "I will commit you to prison." He chose,
   however, to sit down and go no farther with it.

   I have written to Mr. Madison for an attested copy of Mr. Monroe's letter
   to the then Secretary of State Randolph, in which Mr. Monroe gives the
   government an account of his reclaiming me and my liberation in
   consequence of it; and also for an attested copy of Mr. Randolph's answer,
   in which he says: "The President approves what you have done in the case
   of Mr. Paine." The matter I believe is, that, as I had not been
   guillotined, Washington thought best to say what he did. As to Gouverneur
   Morris, the case is that he did reclaim me; but his reclamation did me no
   good, and the probability is, he did not intend it should. Joel Barlow and
   other Americans in Paris had been in a body to reclaim me, but their
   application, being unofficial, was not regarded. I then applied to Morris.
   I shall subpoena Morris, and if I get attested copies from the

   Secretary of State's office it will prove the lie on the inspectors.

   As it is a new generation that has risen up since the declaration of
   independence, they know nothing of what the political state of the country
   was at the time the pamphlet Common Sense appeared; and besides this there
   are but few of the old standers left, and none that I know of in this
   city.

   It may be proper at the trial to bring the mind of the court and the jury
   back to the times I am speaking of, and if you see no objection in your
   way, I wish you would write a letter to some person, stating, from your
   own knowledge, what the condition of those times were, and the effect
   which the work Common Sense, and the several members of the Crisis had
   upon the country. It would, I think, be best that the letter should begin
   directly on the subject in this manner: Being informed that Thomas Paine
   has been denied his rights of citizenship by certain persons acting as
   inspectors at an election at New Rochelle, etc.

   I have put the prosecution into the hands of Mr. Riker, district attorney,
   who can make use of the letter in his address to the Court and Jury. Your
   handwriting can be sworn to by persons here, if necessary. Had you been on
   the spot I should have subpoenaed you, unless it had been too inconvenient
   to you to have attended.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.
