   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This article was written after Paine read a pamphlet entitled Cursory
   Reflections on the Single Combat or Modern Duel. Addressed to Gentlemen in
   every Class of Life, the author of which remains unknown. Paine's article
   appeared in the Pennsylvania Magazine of May, 1775.

   Paine and Jefferson both voiced disapproval of the "murderous Practice of
   Duelling," regarding it as a hang-over from the age of feudalism and
   entirely out of date in civilized society. Paine was not too confident
   that the practice would soon disappear, and the number of duels fought
   during and immediately after the War for Independence proves that his
   pessimism was justified. For an excellent discussion of the practice of
   duelling in the Revolutionary period, see Evarts B. Greene, "The Code of
   Honor in Colonial and Revolutionary Times, with Special Reference to New
   England," in Colonial Society of Massachusetts, Publications, vol. XXVI,
   1925, pp. 367-388.

   GOTHIC and absurd as the custom of duelling is generally allowed to be,
   there are advocates for it on principle; reasoners, who coolly argue for
   the necessity and even convenience, of this mode of accommodating certain
   kinds of personal differences, and of redressing certain species of
   injuries, for which the laws have not provided proper or adequate
   remedies: they conclude, therefore, that an appeal to the sword is a
   requisite supplement to the law, and that this sort of satisfaction for
   extra judicial offences, must take place till some other mode shall be
   devised and established. The learned Dr. Robertson has observed, in favor
   of this practice-even while he condemns it-that its influence on modern
   manners, has been found, in some respects, beneficial to mankind.

   "To this absurd custom," says he, "we must ascribe, in some degree, the
   extraordinary gentleness and complaisance of modern manners, and that
   respectful attention of one man to another, which, at present, render the
   social intercourses of life far more agreeable and decent than amongst the
   most civilized nations of antiquity."1

   The author of these considerations ["Cursory Reflections"] reduces the
   arguments which have been offered in behalf of the private combat to these
   two.

   I. That the duel is the only expedient to obtain satisfaction for those
   injuries of which the laws take no cognizance.

   II. That a man of honor is bound on pain of infamy to resent every
   indignity that may be offered to him with the point of his sword or with a
   pistol.

   These positions our sensible author undertakes to refute; and we shall
   give a specimen of his reasoning: but, first, it will not be improper to
   lay before our readers part of what he has said on the origin of the
   single combat, or duel.

   "The ancient states," says he, "of Greece and Rome, from whence we derive
   the noblest-models of heroism, supported private honor, without delivering
   down to us any evidences of this baneful custom of demanding so severe a
   decision of private affronts; which, considering the military spirit of
   these nations, must, if it obtained at all, have proved more destructive
   to them at home, than the united swords of their enemies abroad. The
   practice is in fact of later and more ignoble birth; the judicial combat,
   the parent of modern duels, springing from monkish superstition, grafted
   on feudal barbarism. Whoever reads Hurd's entertaining and ingenious
   "Letters on Chivalry and Romance," with Robertson's elaborate "History of
   the Emperor Charles V.," will no longer hesitate concerning the clear
   fact.

   "The judicial combat obtained in ignorant ages, on a conclusion that in
   this appeal to Providence, innocence and right would be pointed out by
   victory, and guilt stigmatised and punished by defeat. But alas!
   Experience at length taught us not to expect a miraculous interposition,
   whenever superior strength, superior skill, and superior bravery or
   ferocity, either or all of them, happened to appear on the side of
   injustice."

   Dr. Robertson, above quoted, denies the fashion (as the writer of these
   reflections has observed) of terminating private differences by the sword,
   or pistol, by the illustrious example of the challenge sent by Francis I.
   of France to the Emperor Charles V. This was not, indeed, the first
   instance of such challenges, among princes; but, as our author remarks,
   the dignity of the parties, in the present case, afforded a sufficient
   sanction for extending this mode of deciding differences; to which we may
   add, that the spirit of chivalry and romantic knight-hood still prevailing
   in those fighting times, was continually exciting the heroes of the age to
   this mode of proving their personal prowess and valor.

   We now return to our author's manner of reasoning upon the postulata
   before stated:

   "With respect to the first argument," says he, "if we annex any determined
   ideas to our words, by satisfaction we are to understand redress,
   compensation, amends or atonement. Now, gentlemen! for the sake of all
   that is valuable in life, condescend for a minute to bring down your
   refined notions to the sure standard of common sense, and then weigh the
   satisfaction to be obtained in a duel.

   "Is satisfaction to be enforced from an adversary by putting a weapon into
   his hand, and standing a contention with him, life for life, upon an equal
   chance?

   "Is an offender against the rules of gentility, or against the obligations
   of morality, a man presumptively destitute of honor himself, fairly
   entitled to this equal chance of extending an injury already committed, to
   the irreparable degree of taking the life also from an innocent man?

   "If a gentleman is infatuated enough to meet a person who has degraded
   himself from the character of a gentleman, upon these equal terms, and
   loses a limb, or his life, what species of satisfaction can that be
   called? But it is better to suffer death than indignity. What, from the
   injurious hand? Correct your ideas, and you will esteem life too valuable
   to be complimented away for a mistaken notion.

   "If the aggressor falls, the full purpose of the injured person is thus
   answered, but what is the satisfaction? The survivor becomes a refugee,
   like a felon; or if he should be cleared by the equivocal tenderness of a
   court of justice, must he not be a barbarian instead of a gentleman, who
   can feed upon this inhuman bloody satisfaction, without experiencing the
   pangs of self-reproach, for having sacrificed the life of a fellow
   creature to a mere punctilio; and perhaps involved the ruin of an innocent
   family by the brutal deed? If, on the other hand, he is really a mistaken
   man of humanity, what has he obtained? The satisfaction of embittering all
   the remainder of his life with the keenest sorrow; of having forfeited all
   his future peace of mind by a consciousness of guilt, from which his
   notions of honor can never release him, till the load drags him down to
   the grave!

   "If a man of strict honor is reduced to beg his life of a mere pretender
   to honor, a scoundrel, what satisfaction can this be esteemed? Is not this
   a mortifying, a painful aggravation of a wrong already sustained? What
   consolation can honor afford for such a disgrace?"

   Our author has some other very sensible animadversions on this first
   branch of the argument in defence of duelling; after which, he proceeds to
   the second plea, viz. "The obligation of resenting affronts in this
   manner, founded on the infamy of suspected courage"; and, in our opinion,
   he satisfactorily proves that this argument is by no means irrefragable:
   but for his reasoning on this delicate point, we must refer to his
   pamphlet, and proceed to take notice of his plan for putting a stop to the
   practice of duelling.

   In the first place, he recommends that a law be passed, "declaring the act
   of sending a challenge, or the reducing a person to defend his life with
   sword or pistol, to be felony; and the killing a person in a duel, to be
   punished as murder, without benefit of clergy, unless sufficient proof is
   made that the party killed, really urged the combat.

   As this first part of his proposal relates rather to the mode of
   punishing, than the means of preventing duels, he proceeds:

   "In every quarrel between two gentlemen where satisfaction is thought
   necessary, let the parties be empowered to summon a jury of honor from
   among their friends, six to be appointed by one gentleman, and six by the
   other, or in case of a refusal of either party, let the six chosen by the
   other complete the number by their own appointment, each nominating one;
   and finally, let all this be done, if possible, free from the embarrassing
   intervention of lawyers.

   "Let this jury of honor, when duly assembled, discuss the merits of the
   dispute in question, and form their opinion by a majority of votes; but to
   guard against generating fresh quarrels by the discovery of the votes on
   either side, let the whole twelve be bound to secrecy upon their honor,
   and the whole twelve sign the verdict of the majority. Let a copy of this
   verdict be delivered to the gentleman whose conduct is condemned; and if
   he refuses to make the required concession or due satisfaction, let this
   opinion be published in such a manner as may be thought proper, and be
   understood to divest him of his character as a gentleman so long as he
   remains contumacious.

   "By this single expedient, conveyed in few words, it is hoped the
   necessity of duels may be effectually superseded, the practice suppressed,
   and ample satisfaction enforced for all injuries of honor. In the
   examination of subjects of importance we are often tempted to overlook the
   thing we want, on a supposition that it cannot be near at hand. This plan
   may perhaps admit of amendment, but it is feared the more complicated it
   is rendered, the more difficult it may prove to carry into execution: and
   it is hoped, as it is, it will not be the worse thought of, for coming
   from an unknown pen."

   With respect to the practicability of this scheme, we apprehend that the
   great difficulty would lie in obliging the quarrelling parties, or either
   of them (who by the author's plan are merely empowered), to refer the
   matter to a court of honor. But the writer does not give this as a
   finished plan: he barely suggests the hint; leaving others to improve upon
   it, if thought worthy of farther consideration.

   As to the proposed act for punishing the survivor, where one of the
   parties has fallen in the conflict, it is, indeed, a melancholy truth,
   that our laws in being have been found inadequate to the purpose of
   preventing duels by the dread of legal consequences. The king of Sweden's
   method was virtually the same which is here recommended; and it is said to
   have been effectual in that kingdom.

   The great Gustavus Adolphus, finding that the custom of dueling was
   becoming alarmingly prevalent among the officers in his army, was
   determined to suppress, if possible, those false notions of honor.

   Soon after the king had formed this resolution, and issued some very
   rigorous edicts against the practice, a quarrel arose between two of his
   generals; who agreed to crave His Majesty's pardon to decide the quarrel
   by the laws of honor. The king consented, and said he would be a spectator
   of the combat; he went, accordingly, to the place appointed, attended by a
   body of guards, and the public executioner. He then told the combatants
   that "they must fight till one of them died"; and turning to the
   executioner, he added, "Do you immediately strike off the head of the
   survivor." The monarch's inflexibility had the desired effect: the
   difference between the two officers was adjusted; and no more challenges
   were heard of in the army of Gustavus Adolphus.

   From the peculiar prevalence of this custom in countries where the
   religious system is established, which, of all others, most expressly
   prohibits the gratification of revenge, with every species of outrage and
   violence, we too plainly see, how little mankind are, in reality,
   influenced by the principles of the religion by which they profess to be
   guided, and in defence of which they will occasionally risk even their
   lives.
