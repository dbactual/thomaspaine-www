   AN ACT FOR INCORPORATING THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,

   HELD AT PHILADELPHIA FOR PROMOTING USEFUL KNOWLEDGE

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This Bill was entered by Paine, as Clerk of the General Assembly of
   Pennsylvania during its second reading on February 14, 1780. It was later
   published as his in London, and a copy deposited in the British Museum.
   The Society emerged from the Junto, a club organized by Benjamin Franklin
   in 1727 in Philadelphia. Ironically enough, Paine was rejected for
   membership in the Society in 1781, and was not elected a member until
   January 22, 1785. See Library Bulletin of the American Philosophical
   Society, 1943, p. 71.

   Paine's interest in "the cultivation of useful knowledge, and the
   advancement of the liberal arts and sciences" was so great that he
   believed that a historical "society for inquiring into the ancient state
   of the worker and the state of ancient history, so far as history is
   connected with systems of religion ancient and modern, may be a useful and
   instructive institution." See Paine's letter to Lewis Morris for further
   discussion of Philosophical Societies.

   ***



   WHEREAS the cultivation of useful knowledge, and the advancement of the
   liberal arts and sciences in any country, have the most direct tendency
   toward the improvement of agriculture, the enlargement of trade, the ease
   and comfort of life, the ornament of society, and the ease and happiness
   of mankind. And whereas this country of North America, which the goodness
   of providence hath given us to inherit, from the vastness of its extent,
   the variety of its climate, the fertility of its soil, the yet unexplored
   treasures of its bowels, the multitude of its rivers, lakes, bays, inlets
   and other conveniences of navigation, offers to these United States one of
   the richest subjects of cultivation ever presented to any people upon
   earth. And whereas the experience of ages shows that improvements of a
   public nature are best carried on by societies of liberal and ingenious
   men, uniting their labors without regard to nation, sect, or party, in one
   grand pursuit, alike interesting to all, whereby mutual prejudices are
   worn off, a humane and philosophical spirit is cherished, and youth is
   stimulated to a laudable diligence and emulation in the pursuit of wisdom.

   And whereas, upon these principles, divers public-spirited gentlemen of
   Pennsylvania and other American States did heretofore unite themselves,
   under certain regulations into one voluntary Society, by the name of "The
   American Philosophical Society, held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful
   Knowledge," and by their successful labors and investigations, to the
   great credit of America, have extended their reputation so far, that men
   of the first eminence in the republic of letters in the most civilized
   nations of Europe have done honor to their publications, and desired to be
   enrolled among their members: And whereas the said Society, after having
   been long interrupted in their laudable pursuits by the calamities of war,
   and the distresses of our country, have found means to revive their
   design, in hopes of being able to prosecute the same with their former
   success, and of being further encouraged therein by the public, for which
   purpose they have prayed us, the representatives of the freemen of the
   Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that they may be created one body politic
   and corporate forever, with such powers, and privileges, and immunities as
   may be necessary for answering the valuable purposes which the said
   Society had originally in view.

   Wherefore, in order to encourage the said Society in the prosecution and
   advancement of all useful branches of knowledge, for the benefit of their
   country and mankind, Be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted by the
   representatives of the freemen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in
   General Assembly met, and by the authority of the same. That the members
   of the said Philosophical Society, heretofore voluntarily associated for
   promoting useful knowledge, and such other persons as have been duly
   elected members and officers of the same, agreeably to the fundamental
   laws and regulations of the said Society* comprised in twelve sections,
   prefixed to their first volume of transactions, published in Philadelphia,
   and such other laws and regulations as shall hereafter be duly made and
   enacted by the Society, according to the tenor hereof, be and for ever
   hereafter shall be, one body corporate and politic in deed, by the name
   and style of "The American Philosophical Society held at Philadelphia, for
   promoting useful knowledge."

   And whereas-nations truly civilized (however unhappily at variance on
   other accounts) will never wage war with the arts and sciences, and the
   common interests of humanity; Be it further enacted by the authority
   aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for the said Society, by their
   proper officers, at all times, whether in peace or war, to correspond with
   learned societies, as well as individual learned men, of any nation or
   country; upon matters merely belonging to the business of the said
   Societies, such as the mutual communication of their discoveries and
   proceedings in philosophy and science; the procuring books, apparatus,
   natural curiosities, and such other articles and intelligence as are
   usually exchanged between learned bodies, for furthering their common
   pursuits: Provided always, that such correspondence of the said Society be
   at all times open to the inspection of the supreme Executive Council of
   this Commonwealth, etc.
