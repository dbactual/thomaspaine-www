   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   New Rochelle (N.Y) Sep 30 '05

   Dear Sir

   I write you this letter entirely on my own account, and I begin it without
   ceremony.

   In the year 84 or 5 a motion was made in the legislature of Virginia for
   making an acknowledgement to me for voluntary services during the
   revolution. The bill, as I am informed, for that purpose, passed two
   readings and was lost on the third reading by three votes. The
   acknowledgement proposed to be given was a tract of land, called, as I
   have been told, the secretary's tract, which I suppose is since disposed
   of, but I wish the matter to be brought over again and I think it ought to
   be.

   After the State of Rhode Island had refused complying with the five per
   cent duty recommended by Congress and the State of Virginia had repealed
   the Act she had passed to grant it, I saw no possibility of going on
   otherwise than by authorizing Congress to make laws for the Union in all
   cases that were to extend equally over all the states, and I wrote to
   Chancellor Livingston, minister for foreign affairs, and Robert Morris
   minister of finance in the winter of 81-2 on the subject. The proposal
   in the letter, was, to add a continental legislature to Congress. The Idea
   took with them at once. But as this would be called encreasing the power
   of Congress, and as I intended taking up the subject when I should see the
   Country wrong enough to be put right, it was best, on that account, to
   leave it to the States individually to make me what acknowledgement they
   pleased, and it was on this ground that the state of New York made me a
   present of a farm worth at that time about a thousand pound (York
   currency) and the state of Pennsylvania voted me five hundred pounds, but
   the state of Virginia having negatived the grant she had proposed to make
   me, on the recommendation of Genl Washington, the matter went no
   further with any of the States.

   I suggest another Idea, which is, that as only two of the states have made
   me any acknowledgement, that Congress take up the subject for the whole (I
   suppose the two States who have made me an acknowledgement will not object
   to this) and grant me a tract of land that I can make something of. Had it
   not been for the economy and extreme frugality with which I have lived I
   should at this time of life be in an unpleasant situation. But I wish you
   to be assured that whatever event this proposal may take it will make no
   alteration in my principles or my conduct. I have been a volunteer to the
   world for thirty years without taking profits from anything I have
   published in America or in Europe. I have relinquished all profits that
   those publications might come cheap among the people for whom they were
   intended.

   Yours in friendship
