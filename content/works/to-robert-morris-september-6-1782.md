   From the original letter at the Huntington Library.

   Borden Town, Sept. 6th, 1782

   I am enjoying the Company of my friends Col. Kirkbride and Mr. Borden at
   this place, where I purpose, (as is my yearly custom) of spending two or
   three weeks, unless any thing in the political world should occasion my
   return sooner.

   As one of my principal designs in getting out my last piece was to give it
   the chance of an European publication, which I suppose it will obtain in
   France and England, I desire you to accept of 50 copies to send to any
   part of Europe or the West Indies.

   I am Sir your Obt Hble Servt

   THOS. PAINE
   
   Borden Town
   
   6 Sept 1782
   
   Thos Paine Esq
   
   with 50 copies of his Reply to Abbe Raynal
   
   Honble Robt. Morris Esquire Philadelphia
