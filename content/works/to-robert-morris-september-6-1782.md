   To Robert Morris  September 6, 1782

   BORDENTOWN,

   SIR:

   I am enjoying the company of my friends Col. Kirkbride and Mr. Borden of
   this place, where I purpose (as is my yearly custom), of spending two or
   three weeks, unless anything in the political world should occasion my
   return sooner.

   As one of my principal designs in getting out my last piece was to give it
   the chance of an European publication, which I suppose it will obtain in
   France and England, I desire you to accept of 50 copies to send to any
   part of Europe or the West Indies.

   I am Sir, Your obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
