   To Colonel [John] Laurens  October 4, 1781

   PHILADELPHIA,

   DEAR SIR:

   I received your favor (by the post) dated Sept. 9th, Head of Elk,
   respecting a mislaid letter. A gentleman who saw you at that place about
   the same time told me he had likewise a letter from you to me which he had
   lost, and that you mentioned something to him respecting baggage. This
   left me in a difficulty to judge whether after writing to me by post, you
   had not found the letter you wrote about, and took that opportunity to
   inform me about it. However, I have wrote to Gen. Heath in case the trunk
   should be there, and enclosed in it a letter to Blodget in case it should
   not. I have yet heard nothing from either. I have preferred forwarding the
   trunk, in case it can be done in a reasonable time, to the opening it, and
   if it cannot, then to open it agreeably to your directions, though I have
   no idea of its being there.

   I went for your boots, the next day after you left town, but they were not
   done, and I directed the man to bring them to me as soon as finished, but
   have since seen nothing of him, neither do I wish him to bring them just
   now, as I must be obliged to borrow the money to pay for them; but I
   imagine somebody else has taken them off his hands. I expect Col. Morgan
   in town on Saturday, who has some money of mine in his hands, and then I
   shall renew my application to the boot-maker.

   I wish you had thought of me a little before you went away, and at least
   endeavored to put matters in a train that I might not have to
   re-experience what has already past. The gentleman who conveys this to
   you, Mr. Burke, is an assistant judge of South Carolina, and one to whose
   friendship I am much indebted. He lodged some time in the house with me.

   I enclose you the paper of this morning, by which you will see that Gillam
   had not sailed (or at least I conclude so) on the 4th of July, as Major
   Jackson was deputy toast master, or Burgos-master, or something, at an
   entertainment of that day. As soon as I can learn anything concerning
   Gillam I will inform you of it.

   I am with every wish for your happiness and success, &c.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Please to present my Compliments and best wishes to the General. I have
   wrote to the Marquis and put all my politics into his letter. A paper with
   Rivington's account of the action is enclosed in the Marquis' letter.
