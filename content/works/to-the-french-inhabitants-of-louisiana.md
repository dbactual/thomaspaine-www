   from the *Aurora*, September 22, 1804
   
   A publication having the appearance of a memorial and remonstrance, to be
   presented to Congress at the ensuing session, has appeared in several
   papers. It is therefore open to examination, and I offer you my remarks
   upon it. The title and introductory paragraph are as follows:

   "To the Congress of the United States, in the Senate and House of
   Representatives convened.
   
   We the subscribers, planters, merchants and
   other inhabitants of Louisiana, respectfully approach the Legislature of
   the United States, with a memorial of *our rights*, a remonstrance against
   certain laws which contravene them, and a petition for that redress to
   which the laws of nature, sanctioned by positive stipulations have
   entitled us."

   It often happens that when one party, or one that thinks itself a party,
   talks much about its rights, it puts those of the other party upon
   examining into their own, and such is the effect produced by your
   memorial.

   A single reading of that memorial will shew it is the work of some person
   who is not of your people. His acquaintance with the cause, commencement,
   progress, and termination of the American revolution decides this point;
   and his making *our* merits in that revolution the ground of *your* claims, as
   if *our* merits could become *yours*, shews he does not understand *your*
   situation.

   We obtained our rights by calmly understanding principles, and by the
   successful event of a long, obstinate, and expensive war. But it is not
   incumbent on us to fight the battles of the world for the world's profit.
   You are already participating, without any merit or expence in obtaining
   it, the blessings of freedom acquired by ourselves; and in proportion as
   you become initiated into the principles and practise of the
   representative system of government, of which you have yet had no
   experience, you will participate more and finally be partakers of the
   whole. You see what mischief ensued in France by the possession of power before
   they understood principles. They earned liberty in words but not in fact.
   The writer of this was in France through the whole of the revolution and
   knows the truth of what he speaks; for after endeavouring to give it
   principle he had nearly fallen a victim to its rage.

   There is a great want of judgment in the person who drew up your memorial.
   He has mistaken *your* case, and forgotten his *own*; and by trying to court
   your applause has injured your pretensions. He has written like a lawyer,
   straining every point that would please his client, without studying his
   advantage. I find no fault with the composition of the memorial, for it is well
   written; nor with the principles of liberty it contains, considered in the
   abstract. The error lies in the misapplication of them, and in assuming a
   ground they have not a right to stand upon.
   Instead of their serving you as a ground of reclamation against us, they
   change into a satire on yourselves. Why did you not speak thus when you
   ought to have spoken it. We fought for liberty when you stood quiet in
   slavery.

   The author of the memorial injudiciously confounding two distinct cases
   together, has spoken as if he was the memorialist of a body of Americans,
   who after sharing equally with us in all the dangers and hardships of the
   revolutionary war had retired to a distance and made a settlement for
   themselves. If in such a situation congress had established a temporary
   government over them in which they were not personally consulted, they
   would have had a right to speak as the memorial speaks. But your situation
   is different from what the situation of such persons would be, and
   therefore *their* ground of reclamation cannot *of right* become *yours*.
   You are arriving at freedom by the easiest means that any people ever
   enjoyed it; without contest, without expence, and even without any
   contrivance of your own. And you already so far mistake principles that
   under the name of *rights* you ask for *powers*; *power* to *import and enslave
   Africans*; and *to govern* a territory that *we* have *purchased*.

   To give colour to your memorial, you refer to the treaty of cession (in
   which *you were not* one of the contracting parties) concluded at Paris
   between the governments of the United States and France.

   "The third article (you say) of the treaty lately concluded at Paris
   declares, that, the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated
   in the Union of the United States, and admitted *as soon as possible,
   according* to the *principles* of the federal constitution, to the enjoyment
   of all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United
   States, and, *in the mean time*, they shall be protected in the enjoyment of
   their liberty, property, and the exercise of the religion they profess."

   As from your former condition you cannot be much acquainted with
   diplomatic policy, and I am convinced that even the gentleman who drew up
   the memorial is not, I will explain to you the ground of this article. It
   may prevent your running into further errors.

   The territory of Louisiana had been so often ceded to different European
   powers that it became a necessary article on the part of France, and for
   the security of Spain the ally of France, and which accorded perfectly
   with our own principles and intentions, that it should be *ceded no more*;
   and this article, stipulating for the incorporation of Louisiana into the
   union of the United States, stands as a bar against all future cession,
   and at the same time as Well as "*in the mean time;*" secures to you a civil
   and political permanency, personal security and liberty which you never
   enjoyed before.

   France and Spain might suspect (and the suspicion would not have been
   ill founded had the cession been treated for in the Administration of John
   Adams, or when Washington was president, and Alexander Hamilton president
   over him), that we *bought* Louisiana for the British Government, or with a
   view of selling it to her; and though such suspicion had no just ground to
   stand upon with respect to our present president *Thomas Jefferson*, who is
   not only not a man of intrigue, but who possesses that honest pride of
   principle that cannot be intrigued with, and which keeps intriguers at a
   distance, the article was nevertheless necessary as a precaution against
   *future* contingencies. But you, from not knowing the political ground of the article, apply to
   yourselves *personally* and *exclusively* what had reference to the *territory*
   to prevent its falling into the hands of any foreign power that might
   endanger the *Spanish* dominions in America, or those of
   the *French* in the West India islands.

   You claim (you say,) to be incorporated into the Union of the United
   States, and your remonstrances on this subject are unjust and without
   cause.

   You are already *incorporated* into it as fully and effectually as the
   Americans themselves are, who are settled in Louisiana. You enjoy the same
   rights, privileges, advantages and immunities which they enjoy, and when
   Louisiana, or some part of it, shall be erected into a constitutional
   state, you also will be citizens equal with them.

   You speak in your memorial, as if *you* were the *only* people who were to
   live in Louisiana, and as if the territory was purchased that you
   exclusively might govern it. In both these cases you are greatly mistaken.
   The emigrations from the United States into the purchased territory, and
   the population arising therefrom will, in a few years exceed you in
   numbers. It is but twenty-six years since Kentucky began to be settled,
   and it already contains more than *double* your population.

   In a candid view of the case, you ask for what would be injurious to
   yourselves to receive, and unjust in us to grant. &mdash; *Injurious*, because the
   settlement of Louisiana will go on much faster under the government and
   guardianship of congress than if the government of it were committed to
   *your* hands; and consequently the landed property you possessed as
   individuals when the treaty was concluded, or have purchased since, will
   increase so much faster in value. &mdash; *Unjust to ourselves*, because as the reimbursements of the purchase money
   must come out of the sale of the lands to new settlers the government of
   it cannot suddenly go out of the hands of congress. They are guardians of
   that property for *all the people of the United States*.
   And besides this, as the new settlers will be chiefly from the United
   States, it would be unjust and ill policy to put them and their property
   under the jurisdiction of a people whose freedom they had contributed to
   purchase. You ought also to recollect that the French Revolution has not exhibited
   to the world that grand display of principles and rights that would induce
   settlers from other countries to put themselves under a French
   jurisdiction in Louisiana. Beware of intriguers who may push you on from
   private motives of their own.

   You complain of two cases, one of which you have *no right*, no concern
   with; and the other is founded in direct injustice.

   You complain that Congress has passed a law to divide the country into two
   territories. It is not improper to inform you, that after the
   revolutionary war ended, Congress divided the territory acquired by that
   war, into ten territories; each of which was to be erected into a
   constitutional state, when it arrived at a certain population mentioned in
   the act; and in the mean time, an officer appointed by the President, as
   the governor of Louisiana now is, presided, as governor of the western
   territory over all such parts as have not arrived at the maturity of
   *statehood*. Louisiana will require to be divided into twelve States or more; but this
   is a matter that belongs to the *purchaser* of the territory of Louisiana,
   and with which the inhabitants of the town of N-Oleans have no right to
   interfere; and beside this it is probable that the inhabitants of the
   other territory would choose to be independent of New Orleans. They might
   apprehend, that on some speculating pretence, their produce might be put in
   requisition, and a maximum price put on it; a thing not uncommon in a
   French government &mdash; as a general rule, without refining upon sentiment, one may put confidence
   in the justice of those who have no inducement to do us injustice; and
   this is the case Congress stands in with respect to both territories, and
   to all other divisions that may be laid out, and to all inhabitants and
   settlers of whatever nation they may be.

   There can be no such thing as what the memorial speaks of, that is, *of a
   governor appointed by the President, who may have no interest in the
   welfare of Louisiana. He must, from the nature of the case*, have more
   interest in it than any other person can have. He is entrusted with the
   care of an extensive tract of country, now the property of the United
   States by purchase. The value of those lands will depend on the encreasing prosperity of
   Louisiana, its agriculture, commerce, and population. 
   You have only a local and partial interest in the town of New Orleans or
   its vicinity; and if, in consequence of exploring the country, new seats
   of commerce should offer, his general interest would lead him to open
   them, and your partial interest to shut them up.

   There is probably some justice in your remark as it applies to the
   governments under which you *formerly* lived. Such governments always look
   with jealousy, and an apprehension of revolt, on colonies encreasing in
   prosperity and population and they send governors to *keep them down*.
   But when you argue from the conduct of governments *distant* and *despotic*,
   to that of *domestic* and *free* government, it shews you do not understand
   the principles and interest of a republic, and to put you right is
   friendship; we have had experience and you have not.

   The other case to which I alluded as being founded in direct injustice, is
   that in which you petition for *power*, under the name of *rights*, to import
   and enslave Africans!

   *Dare you put up a petition to Heaven for such a power, without fearing to
   be struck from the earth by its justice?

   *Why then do you ask it of man against man?

   *Do you want to renew in Louisiana the horrors of Domingo?*

   COMMON SENSE.
