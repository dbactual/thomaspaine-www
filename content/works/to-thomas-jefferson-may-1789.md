   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Explanatory Circumstances 

   1 &mdash; The lost dispatches are dated Octr 6th & Oct 7th. &mdash; they
   were sent by a private hand, &mdash; that is, they were not sent by the post.
   &mdash; Capt. Folger had the charge of them. &mdash; They were all under one 
   cover containing five separate Packets, three of the Packets were on 
   commercial matters only &mdash; One of these was to Mr. R Morris &mdash; 
   Chairman of the
   Commercial Committees &mdash; One to Mr. Hancock (private concerns) another to
   Barneby Deane, S. Deane's brother. &mdash; of the other two Packets, one of 
   them was to the Secret Committee, then stiled the Committee of foreign 
   Affairs &mdash; the other was to Richd H. Lee &mdash; These two last packets 
   had nothing in them but blank white French paper &mdash;

   2 &mdash; In Sepr. preceding the date of the dispatches, Mr. B &mdash; sent 
   Mr. Francis to Congress to press payment to the amount
   mentioned in the Official Letter of Oct. 6 &mdash; Mr. F &mdash; brought a 
   letter signed only by S Deane &mdash; The Capt of the vessel (Landais) 
   brought another letter from Deane both of these letters were to enforce Mr. 
   B &mdash; demand. Mr. F &mdash; arrived with his letter and demand &mdash; 
   The official dispatches (if I may say so) arrived blank &mdash; Congress had 
   therefore no authoritative Information to act by &mdash; About this time Mr. 
   D &mdash; was recalled, and arrived in America in
   Count D'Estain's fleet &mdash; He gave out that he had left his accounts in
   France &mdash;

   With the treaty of Alliance came over the duplicates of the lost
   dispatches &mdash; They came into my office not having been seen by Congress 
   &mdash; and as they contained an injunction not to be concealed by Congress, 
   I kept
   them secret in the Office for at that time the foreign Committee were
   dispersed and new members not appointed &mdash;

   On the 5th of Dec 1778 Mr. D published an inflamatory piece against Congress. 
   &mdash; As I saw it had an exceeding Ill effect out of doors I
   made some remarks upon it &mdash; with a view of preventing people running 
   mad &mdash; This piece was replied to by a piece under the signature of 
   Plain Truth &mdash; in which it was stated &mdash; that Mr. D &mdash; though 
   a stranger in France and to the Language, and without money &mdash; 
   had by himself procured 30,000 Stand of Arms, 30,000 such of clothing & more 
   than 200 pieces of Brass Cannon &mdash; I
   replied that these supplies were in a train of Execution before he was
   sent to France. &mdash; That Mr. Deane's private letters, and his official
   dispatches jointly with the other two Commissioners contradicted each
   other &mdash;

   At this time I found that Deane had made a large party in Congress &mdash; 
   and that a motion had been made but not decided upon for dismissing me from
   the foreign office &mdash; with a kind of censure &mdash;
