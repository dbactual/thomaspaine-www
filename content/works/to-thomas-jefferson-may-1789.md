   To Thomas Jefferson  May 1789

   LONDON,

   Explanatory Circumstances [relating to the Deane affair]

   First: The lost dispatches are dated October 6th and October 7th. They
   were sent by a private hand, that is, they were not sent by the post.
   Capt. Folger had the charge of them. They were all under one cover
   containing five separate packets. Three of the packets were on commercial
   matters only; one of these was to Mr. Robert Morris, chairman of the
   commercial committee; one to Mr. Hancock (private concerns), another to
   Barneby Deane, S Deane's brother. Of the other two packets, one of them
   was to the secret committee, then styled the Committee of Foreign Affairs;
   the other was to Richard H. Lee. These two last packets had nothing in
   them but blank white French paper.

   Second: In September preceding the date of the dispatches, Mr. [Edward]
   B[ancroft] sent Mr. Francis to Congress to press payment to the amount
   mentioned in the official letter of Oct. 6. Mr. F brought a letter signed
   only by S Deane. The Captain of the vessel (Landais) brought another
   letter from Deane; both of these letters were to enforce Mr. B demand. Mr.
   F arrived with his letter and demand. The official dispatches (if I may
   say so) arrived blank. Congress had therefore no authoritative information
   to act by. About this time Mr. D was recalled, and arrived in America in
   Count D'Estain's fleet. He gave out that he had left his accounts in
   France.

    With the treaty of alliance came over the duplicates of the lost
   dispatches. They came into my office not having been seen by Congress, and
   as they contained an injunction not to be concealed by Congress, I kept
   them secret in the office because at that time the foreign committee were
   displaced and new members not appointed.

    On the fifth of December, 1778 Mr. D___ published an inflamatory piece
   against Congress. As I saw it had an exceeding ill effect out of doors, I
   made some remarks upon it, with a view of preventing people running wild.
   This piece was replied to by a piece under the signature of Plain Truth,
   in which it was stated that Mr. D ____ though a stranger in France and to
   the language, and without money had by himself procured 30,000 stand of
   arms, 30,000 such of clothing and more than 200 pieces of brass cannon. I
   replied that these supplies were in a train of execution before he was
   sent to France, that Mr. Deane's private letters, and his official
   dispatches jointly with the other two commissioners contradicted each
   other.

   At this time I found that Deane had made a large party in Congress, and
   that a motion had been made but not decided upon for dismissing me from
   the foreign affairs with a kind of censure.
