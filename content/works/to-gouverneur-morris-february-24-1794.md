   To Gouverneur Morris February 24, 1794

   LUXEMBOURG,

   SIR:

   I received your letter enclosing a copy of a letter from the Minister of
   Foreign Affairs. You must not leave me in the situation in which this
   letter places me. You know I do not deserve it, and you see the unpleasant
   situation in which I am thrown. I have made an essay in answer

   to the Minister's letter, which I wish you to make ground of a reply to
   him. They have nothing against me-except that they do not choose I should
   be in a state of freedom to write my mind freely upon things I have seen.
   Though you and I are not on terms of the best harmony, I apply to you as
   the Minister of America, and you may add to that service whatever you
   think my integrity deserves. At any rate I expect you to make Congress
   acquainted with my situation, and to send to them copies of the letters
   that have passed on the subject. A reply to the Minister's letter is
   absolutely necessary, were it only to continue the reclamation. Otherwise
   your silence will be a sort of consent to his observations.

   THOMAS PAINE.
