   To M. Tallyrand  [1797]

   Rue theatre francais No. 4

   CITIZEN MINISTER:

   I send you the letter to Washington. In two or three days I will give you
   some thoughts upon American affairs. I presume you do not mean to assure
   the commissioners of anything at the first interview. It will be best to
   receive them with a civil signification of reproach. Mr. Pinckney has a
   good deal committed himself in his correspondence with Pickering, which
   this last has been foolish enough to publish. Do you know Montflorens
   (Chancel[l]or to the Consulship). If he should visit you on any occasion
   it will be best to keep him at a distance. He is the confidential
   intrigant of Pinckney.

   Salut et respect

   THOMAS PAINE.
