   To James Monroe  August 15, 1794

   Versailles, 28 Thermidor 4 year

   DEAR SIR:

   I am spending some days at. the house of a friend at this place with whom
   I shall make an arrangement to stay some weeks. But I am out of cash and I
   know no method of supplying myself, but by having recourse to your
   friendship, the money to be repaid in America, as before. I have again
   hopes that the complaint in my side is disposing itself to a cure. I am
   better, and have more strength than I have had for a year past. I went in
   the stage boat from Paris to Sevres and walked from Sevres to Versailles.

   I see by the papers that you will have a visit from Mr. Hammond if the
   Directoire will permit him to come to Paris which I think is doubtful. In
   this state of things one cannot help reflecting on the conduct of the
   American governm[en]t that of soliciting a dishonorable treaty with a
   governm[en]t that is now soliciting peace on any terms. I hope to see you
   in Paris in three or four days.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.
