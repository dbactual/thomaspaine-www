   To Robert Morris  December 7, 1782

   Second Street, PHILADELPHIA,

   DEAR SIR:

   Understanding that Congress has appointed a deputation to Rhode Island, I
   transmit a thought on that subject.

   Considering how unwilling men are to recede from fixed opinions, and that
   they feel something like disgrace to being convinced, the way to obtain
   something is to give something. And as it is necessary in the present
   case, to cast about for every proposition, suppose R[hode] I[sland] was to
   pass the law for two years, providing that at the expiration of one year,
   a deputation from the legislatures of all the States were to meet, to
   confer on any inconveniences that the present state of the several acts
   might be encumbered with, and adjust a plan suitable to the circumstances
   of the whole.

   The term of two years will carry our system beyond any present hope of the
   enemy, and the meeting or conference at the end of one year, may be a
   means of bringing about a more compact Union, and the States severally be
   eased in the meantime of every apprehension right or wrong.

   THOMAS PAINE.
