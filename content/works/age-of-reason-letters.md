   I. AN ANSWER TO A FRIEND

   PARIS, May 12, 1797

   IN your letter of the 20th of March, you give me several quotations from
   the Bible, which you call the 'word of God,' to shew me that my opinions
   on religion are wrong, and I could give you as many, from the same book to
   shew that yours are not right; consequently, then, the Bible decides
   nothing, because it decides any way, and every way, one chooses to make
   it.

   But by what authority do you call the Bible the 'word of God?' for this is
   the first point to be settled. It is not your calling it so that makes it
   so, any more than the Mahometans calling the Koran the 'word of God' makes
   the Koran to be so. The Popish Councils of Nice and Laodicea, about 350
   years after the time the person called Jesus Christ is said to have lived,
   voted the books that now compose what is called the New Testament to be
   the 'word of God.' This was done by yeas and nays, as we now vote a law.
   The pharisees of the second Temple, after the Jews returned from captivity
   in Babylon, did the same by the books that now compose the Old Testament,
   and this is all the authority there is, which to me is no authority at
   all. I am as capable of judging for myself as they were, and I think more
   so, because, as they made a living by their religion, they had a
   self-interest in the vote they gave.

   You may have an opinion that a man is inspired, but you cannot prove it,
   nor can you have any proof of it yourself, because you cannot see into his
   mind in order to know how he comes by his thoughts; and the same is the
   case with the word 'revelation.' There can be no evidence of such a thing,
   for you can no more prove revelation than you can prove what another man
   dreams of, neither can he prove it himself.

   It is often said in the Bible that God spake unto Moses, but how do you
   know that God spake unto Moses? Because, you will say, the Bible says so.
   The Koran says, that God spake unto Mahomet, do you believe that too? No.
   Why not? Because, you will say, you do not believe it; and so because you
   do, and because you don't is all the reason you can give for believing or
   disbelieving except that you will say that Mahomet was an impostor. And
   how do you know Moses was not an imposter? For my own part, I believe that
   all are impostors who pretend to hold verbal communication with the Deity.
   It is the way by which the world has been imposed upon; but if you think
   otherwise you have the same right to your opinion that I have to mine, and
   must answer for it in the same manner. But all this does not settle the
   point, whether the Bible be the 'word of God,' or not. It is therefore
   necessary to go a step further. The case then is: --

   You form your opinion of God from the account given of him in the Bible;
   and I form my opinion of the Bible from the wisdom and goodness of God
   manifested in the structure of the universe, and in all works of Creation.
   The result in these two cases will be, that you, by taking the Bible for
   your standard, will have a bad opinion of God; and I, by taking God for my
   standard, shall have a bad opinion of the Bible.

   The Bible represents God to be a changeable, passionate, vindictive Being;
   making a world and then drowning it, afterwards repenting of what he had
   done, and promising not to do so again. Setting one nation to cut the
   throats of another, and stopping the course of the sun till the butchery
   should be done. But the works of God in the Creation preach to us another
   doctrine. In that vast volume we see nothing to give us the idea of a
   changeable, passionate, vindictive God; everything we there behold
   impresses us with a contrary idea, -- that of unchangeableness and of
   eternal order, harmony, and goodness. The sun and the seasons return at
   their appointed time, and everything in the Creation proclaims that God is
   unchangeable. Now, which am I to believe, a book that any impostor might
   make and call the 'word of God,' or the Creation itself which none but an
   Almighty Power could make? For the Bible says one thing, and the Creation
   says the contrary. The Bible represents God with all the passions of a
   mortal, and the Creation proclaims him with all the attributes of a God.

   It is from the Bible that man has learned cruelty, rapine, and murder; for
   the belief of a cruel God makes a cruel man. That bloodthirsty man, called
   the prophet Samuel, makes God to say, (i Sam. xv. 3,) "Now go and smite
   Amaleck, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but
   slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and
   ass."

   That Samuel or some other impostor might say this, is what, at this
   distance of time, can neither be proved nor disproved, but in my opinion
   it is blasphemy to say, or to believe, that God said it. All our ideas of
   the justice and goodness of God revolt at the impious cruelty of the
   Bible. It is not a God, just and good, but a devil, under the name of God,
   that the Bible describes.

   What makes this pretended order to destroy the Amalekites appear the
   worse, is the reason given for it. The Amalekites, four hundred years
   before, according to the account in Exodus xvii. (but which has the
   appearance of fable from the magical account it gives of Moses holding up
   his hands,) had opposed the Israelites coming into their country, and this
   the Amalckites had a right to do, because the Israelites were the
   invaders, as the Spaniards were the invaders of Mexico; and this
   opposition by the Amalekites, at that time, is given as a reason, that the
   men, women, infants and sucklings, sheep and oxen, camels and asses, that
   were born four hundred years afterwards, should be put to death; and to
   complete the horror, Samuel hewed Agag, the chief of the Amalekites, in
   pieces, as you would hew a stick of wood. I will bestow a few observations
   on this case.

   In the first place, nobody knows who the author, or writer, of the book of
   Samuel was, and, therefore, the fact itself has no other proof than
   anonymous or hearsay evidence, which is no evidence at all. In the second
   place, this anonymous book says, that this slaughter was done by 'the
   express command of God:' but all our ideas of the justice and goodness of
   God give the lie to the book, and as I never will believe any book that
   ascribes cruelty and injustice to God, I therefore reject the Bible as
   unworthy of credit.

   As I have now given you my reasons for believing that the Bible is not the
   word of God, that it is a falsehood, I have a right to ask you your
   reasons for believing the contrary; but I know you can give me none,
   except that you were educated to believe the Bible; and as the Turks give
   the same reason for believing the Koran, it is evident that education
   makes all the difference, and that reason and truth have nothing to do in
   the case. You believe in the Bible from the accident of birth, and the
   Turks believe in the Koran from the same accident, and each calls the
   other 'infidel.' But leaving the prejudice of education out of the case,
   the unprejudiced truth is, that all are infidels who believe falsely of
   God, whether they draw their creed from the Bible, or from the Koran, from
   the Old Testament, or from the New.

   When you have examined the Bible with the attention that I have done, (for
   I do not think you know much about it,) and permit yourself to have just
   ideas of God, you will most probably believe as I do. But I wish you to
   know that this answer to your letter is not written for the purpose of
   changing your opinion. It is written to satisfy you, and some other
   friends whom I esteem, that my disbelief of the Bible is founded on a pure
   and religious belief in God; for in my opinion the Bible is a gross libel
   against the justice and goodness of God, in almost every part of it.

   II. CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE HON. SAMUEL ADAMS

   (EDITOR'S NOTE: The Hon. Samuel Adams (1722-1803) was from the Stamp Act
   agitation of 1764 to the Declaration of Independence in 1776 the
   preeminent revolutionary leader in Massachusetts, and General Gage was
   given orders to send him over to London, where a newspaper predicted that
   his head would appear on Temple Bar. He was sent by Massachusetts, with
   his cousin, John Adams, afterwards President, to the first Continental
   Congress (1774), where be was suspected, with justice, of being favorable
   to separation from England. When Paine published his famous appeal for
   American Independence (January 10, 1776), Samuel Adams was the first
   member of the Congress at his side, and a cordial lifelong relation
   existed between the two. It is to my mind certain that these two men were
   the real pioneers of American Independence, and they were both inspired
   therein by their widely different religious sentiments. Samuel Adams was
   the son of a deacon of the Old South Church, Boston, who sent his son to
   Harvard College with the hope that he would graduate into a minister. The
   son had no taste for theology, but he made up for it by retaining through
   all his career as a lawyer and public man a rigid Puritanism, of which the
   first article was hatred of the British system of royalty and prelacy.
   While Adams's desire for American independence was largely an inheritance
   from New England Puritans, Paine beheld in it a means of establishing a
   Republic based on the principles of Quakerism, -- the divine Light in
   every man by virtue of which all were equal. Samuel Adams died October 2,
   1803. The correspondence here given was printed in the 'National
   Intelligencer,' Washington City, February 2, 1803, as one of a series of
   Ten Letters addressed to "The Citizens of the United States" on his return
   after his fifteen eventful years in Europe. These Letters were printed in
   a pamphlet in London, 1804, by his friend Thomas Clio Rickman, whose task,
   however, was achieved under sad intimidation. Rickman's preface opens with
   the words: "The following little work would not have been published, had
   there been anything in it the least offending against the government or
   individuals." Under this deadly fear the much prosecuted Rickman mutilated
   Paine's letter to Adams a good deal. I have been fortunate in being able
   to print the letter from Paine's own manuscript, which was recently
   discovered among the papers of George Bancroft, the historian, when they
   passed into the possession of the Lenox Library, New York, to whose
   excellent librarian I owe thanks for this and other favors. -- Editor.
   (Conway)]

    

    

   [To the Editor of the "National Intelligencer," Federal City.]

   TOWARDS the latter end of last December 1 received a letter from a
   venerable patriot, Samuel Adams, dated Boston, Nov. 30. It came by a
   private hand, which I suppose was the cause of the delay. I wrote Mr.
   Adams an answer, dated Jan. 1st, and that I might be certain of his
   receiving it, and also that I might know of that reception, I desired a
   friend of mine at Washington to put it under cover to some friend of his
   at Boston, and desire him to present it to Mr. Adams. The letter was
   accordingly put under cover while I was present, and given to one of the
   clerks of the post office to seal and put in the mail. The clerk put it in
   his pocket book, and either forgot to put it into the mail, or supposed he
   had done so among other letters. The postmaster general, on learning this
   mistake, informed me of it last Saturday, and as the cover was then out of
   date, the letter was put under a new cover, with the same request, and
   forwarded by the post. I felt concern at this accident, lest Mr. Adams
   should conclude I was unmindful of his attention to me; and therefore,
   lest any further accident should prevent or delay his receiving it, as
   well as to relieve myself from that concern, I give the letter an
   opportunity of reaching him by the newspapers. I am the more induced to do
   this, because some manuscript copies have been taken of both letters, and
   therefore there is a possibility of imperfect copies getting into print;
   and besides this, if some of the Federal[ist] printers (for I hope they
   are not all base alike) could get hold of a copy, they would make no
   scruple of altering it, and publishing it as mine. I therefore send you
   the original letter of Mr. Adams, and my own copy of the answer.

   Boston, Nov. 30, 1802

   SIR:

    

   I have frequently with pleasure reflected on your services to my native
   and your adopted country. Your 'Common Sense' and your 'Crisis'
   unquestionably awakened the public mind, and led the people loudly to call
   for a Declaration of our national Independence. I therefore esteemed you
   as a warm friend to the liberty and lasting welfare of the human race. But
   when I heard that you had turned your mind to a defence of infidelity, I
   felt myself much astonished and more grieved that you had attempted a
   measure so injurious to the feelings and so repugnant to the true interest
   of so great a part of the citizens of the United States. The people of New
   England, if you will allow me to use a scripture phrase, are fast
   returning to their first love. Will you excite among them the spirit of
   angry controversy, at a time when they are hastening to unity and peace? I
   am told that some of our newspapers have announced your intention to
   publish an additional pamphlet upon the principles of 'your Age of
   Reason.' Do you think that your pen, or the pen of any other man, can
   unchristianize the mass of our citizens, or have you hopes of converting a
   few of them to assist you in so bad a cause? We ought to think ourselves
   happy in the enjoyment of opinion without the danger of persecution by
   civil or ecclesiastical law.

   Our friend, the President of the United States, [Thomas Jefferson] has
   been calumniated for his liberal sentiments, by men who have attributed
   that liberality to a latent design to promote the cause of infidelity.
   This and all other slanders have been made without a shadow of proof.
   Neither religion nor liberty can long subsist in the tumult of
   altercation, and amidst the noise and violence of faction.

   Felix qui cautus.
   Adieu.

   SAMUEL ADAMS.
   [To] Mr. THOMAS PAINE.

    

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   My DEAR AND VENERABLE FRIEND SAMUEL ADAMS:

   I received with great pleasure your friendly and affectionate letter of
   November 30, and I thank you also for the frankness of it. Between men in
   pursuit of truth, and whose object is the Happiness of Man both here and
   hereafter, there ought to be no reserve. Even Error has a claim to
   indulgence, if not to respect, when it is believed to be truth.

    

   I am obliged to you for your affectionate remembrance of what you stile my
   services in awakening the public mind to a declaration of Independence,
   and supporting it after it was declared. I also, like you, have often
   looked back on those times, and have thought that if independence had not
   been declared at the time it was, the public mind could not have been
   brought up to it afterwards. It will immediately occur to you, who were so
   intimately acquainted with the situation of things at that time, that I
   allude to the black times of seventy-six; for though I know, and you my
   friend also know, they were no other than the natural consequence of the
   military blunders of that campaign, the country might have viewed them as
   proceeding from a natural inability to support its Cause against the
   enemy, and have sunk under the despondency of that misconceived Idea. This
   was the impression against which it was necessary the Country should be
   strongly animated.

   I come now to the second part of your letter, on which I shall be as frank
   with you as you are with me.

   But, (say you) when I heard you had turned your mind to a defence of
   infidelity I felt myself much astonished &c." -- What, my good friend, do
   you call believing in God infidelity? for that is the great point
   maintained in The 'Age of Reason' against all divided beliefs and
   allegorical divinities. [NOTE: The ten concluding words of this sentence
   were omitted from Rickman's edition, the close being "in the work alluded
   to." -- Editor.] The bishop of Landaff (Doctor Watson) not only
   acknowledges this, but pays me some compliments upon it (in his answer to
   the second part of that work). "There is (says he) a philosophical
   sublimity in some of your Ideas when speaking of the Creator of the
   Universe."

   What then (my much esteemed friend for I do not respect you the less
   because we differ, and that perhaps not much, in religious sentiments),
   what, I ask, is this thing called infidelity? If we go back to your
   ancestors and mine three or four hundred years ago, for we must have had
   fathers and grandfathers or we should not be here, we shall find them
   praying to Saints and Virgins, and believing in purgatory and
   transubstantiation; and therefore all of us are infidels according to our
   forefathers' belief. If we go back to times more ancient we shall again be
   infidels according to the belief of some other forefathers.

   The case my friend is, that the World has been over-run with fable and
   creeds of human invention, with sectaries of whole Nations against all
   other Nations, and sectaries of those sectaries in each of them against
   each other. Every sectary, except the quakers, has been a persecutor.
   Those who fled from persecution persecuted in their turn, and it is this
   confusion of creeds that has filled the World with persecution and deluged
   it with blood. Even the depredation on your commerce by the barbary powers
   sprang from the Crusades of the church against those powers. It was a war
   of creed against creed, each boasting of God for its author, and reviling
   each other with the name of Infidel. If I do not believe as you believe,
   it proves that you do not believe as I believe, and this is all that it
   proves.

   There is however one point of Union wherein all religions meet, and that
   is in the first article of every Man's Creed, and of every Nation's Creed,
   that has any Creed at all: 'I believe in God.' Those who rest here, and
   there are millions who do, cannot be wrong as far as their Creed goes.
   Those who chouse to go further may be wrong, for it is impossible that all
   can be right, since there is so much contradiction among them. The first
   therefore are, in my opinion, on the safest side.

   I presume you are so far acquainted with ecclesiastical history as to
   know, and the bishop who has answered me has been obliged to acknowledge
   the fact, that the books that compose the New Testament were voted by
   'Yeas and Nays' to be the Word of God, as you now vote a law, by the
   popish Councils of Nice and Laodocia about 1450 years ago. With respect to
   the fact there is no dispute, neither do I mention it for the sake of
   controversy. This Vote may appear authority enough to some, and not
   authority enough to others. It is proper however that everybody should
   know the fact.

   [EDITORS NOTE: This (the above) paragraph was omitted by Rickman with a
   footnote saying A paragraph of eleven lines is here omitted, it being a
   principle with the Editor to offend neither the government nor
   individuals. Its insertion is also unnecessary, as the curious reader will
   find it answered in a way well worth his notice by the bishop of Landaff.
   See his apology for the Bible, from page 300 to 307." The title "Age of
   Reason" is also suppressed in the next paragraph, and elsewhere. --
   Editor. (Conway)]

   With respect to 'The Age of Reason,' which you so much condemn, and that I
   believe without having read it, for you say only that you 'heard' of it, I
   will inform you of a Circumstance, because you cannot know it by other
   means.

   I have said in the first page of the First Part of that work that it had
   long been my intention to publish my thoughts upon Religion, but that I
   had reserved it to a later time of life. I have now to inform you why I
   wrote it and published it at the time I did.

   In the first place, I saw my life in continual danger. My friends were
   falling as fast as the guillotine could cut their heads off, and as I
   every day expected the same fate, I resolved to begin my Work. I appeared
   to myself to be on my death-bed, for death was on every side of me, and I
   had no time to lose. This accounts for my writing it at the time I did;
   and so nicely did the time and the intention meet, that I had not finished
   the first part of that Work more than six hours before I was arrested and
   taken to prison. Joel Barlow was with me and knows the fact.

   In the second place, the people of francs were running headlong into
   Atheism, and I had the work translated and published in their own language
   to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article (as I have
   before said) of every man's Creed who has any Creed at all, 'I believe in
   God.' I endangered my own life, in the first place by opposing in the
   Convention the execution of the king, and by laboring to shew they were
   trying the Monarchy and not the Man, and that the crimes imputed to him
   were the crimes of the monarchical [NOTE: This word (monarchical) is
   omitted by Rickman.-- Editor.] system; and I endangered it a second time
   by opposing Atheism; and yet some of your priests, for I do not believe
   that all are perverse, cry out, in the war-whoop of monarchical
   priestcraft, What an Infidel, what a wicked Man, is Thomas Paine! They
   might as well add, for he believes in God and is against shedding blood.

   But all this 'war-whoo' of the pulpit [The words "of the pulpit" omitted
   by Rickman. -- Editor.] has some concealed object. Religion is not the
   Cause, but is the stalking horse. They put it forward to conceal
   themselves behind it. It is not a secret that there has been a party
   composed of the leaders of the federalists, for I do not include all
   federalists with their leaders, who have been working by various means for
   several years past to overturn the federal Constitution established on the
   representative system, and place Government in the new World on the
   corrupt system of the old. [The preceding fourteen words omitted by
   Rickman. -- Editor.] To accomplish this, a large standing army was
   necessary, and as a pretence for such an army the danger of a foreign
   invasion must be bellowed forth from the pulpit, from the press, and by
   their public orators.

   I am not of a disposition inclined to suspicion. It is in its nature a
   mean and cowardly passion, and upon the whole, even admitting error into
   the case, it is better, I am sure it is more generous, to be wrong on the
   side of confidence than on the side of suspicion. [The words "it is
   better" and "on the side of Confidence than" are dropped out of the
   sentence in Rickman's edition. -- Editor.] But I know as a fact that the
   english Government distributes annually fifteen hundred pounds sterling
   among the presbyterian ministers in England and one thousand among those
   of Ireland; [See vol. iii. p. 85, of my edition of 'Paine's Writings';
   where the amounts are stated as 1,700 pounds to the dissenting Ministers
   in England, and 800 pounds to those of Ireland. -- The preceding 29 words,
   and the remainder of this paragraph, are omitted by Rickman. -- Editor]
   and when I hear of the strange discourses of some of your ministers and
   professors of Colleges, I cannot, as the quakers say, find freedom in my
   mind to acquit them. Their anti-revolutionary doctrines invite suspicion
   even against one's will, and in spite of one's charity to believe well of
   them.

   As you have given me one scripture phrase I will give you another for
   those ministers. It is said in Exodus xxii. 28, "Thou shalt not revile the
   Gods nor curse the ruler of thy people." But those ministers, such I mean
   as Dr. Emmons, [Nathaniel Emmons, D.D. (1745-1840), fifty-four years
   minister of the Franklin, Mass., Congregational Church. He was a vehement
   Federalist, and assailant of President Jefferson. -- Editor.] curse ruler
   and people both, for the majority are, politically, the people, and it is
   those who have chosen the ruler whom they curse. As to the first part of
   the verse, that of not reviling the Gods, it makes no part of my
   scripture. I have but one God. [This and the preceding sentence are
   omitted by Rickman. -- Editor.]

   Since I began this letter, for I write it by piece-meals as I have
   leisure, I have seen the four letters that passed between you and John
   Adams. In your first letter you say, "Let divines and Philosophers,
   statesmen and patriots, unite their endeavors to 'renovate the age' by
   inculcating in the minds of youth 'the fear and love of the Deity and
   universal philanthropy." Why, my dear friend, this is exactly my religion,
   and is the whole of it. That you may have an Idea that 'The Age of Reason'
   (for I believe you have not read it) inculcates this reverential fear and
   love of the Deity I will give you a paragraph from it.

   "Do we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the immensity of the
   Creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom: We see it in the
   unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible Whole is governed. Do we
   want to contemplate his munificence? We see it in the abundance with which
   he fills the Earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We see it in his
   not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful."

   As I am fully with you in your first part, that respecting the Deity, so
   am I in your second, that of 'universal Philanthropy which I do not mean
   merely the sentimental benevolence of wishing well, but the practical
   benevolence of doing good. We cannot serve the Deity in the manner we
   serve those who cannot do without that service. He needs no service from
   us. We can add nothing to eternity. But it is in our power to render a
   service 'acceptable' to him, and that is not by praying, but by
   endeavoring to make his creatures happy. A man does not serve God when be
   prays, for it is himself he is trying to serve; and as to hiring or paying
   men to pray, as if the Deity needed instruction, it is, in my opinion, an
   abomination. One good schoolmaster is of more use and of more value than a
   load of such persons as Dr. Emmons and some others. [This and the
   preceding sentence omitted by Rickman. -- Editor.]

   You, my dear and much respected friend, are now far in the vale of years;
   I have yet, I believe, some years in store, for I have a good state of
   health and a happy mind, and I take care of both, by nourishing the first
   with temperance and the latter with abundance. This, I believe, you will
   allow to be the true philosophy of life. You will see by my third letter
   to the Citizens of the United States that I have been exposed to, and
   preserved through, many dangers; but instead of buffeting the Deity with
   prayers as if I distrusted him, or must dictate to him, [This and the
   seventeen preceding words omitted by Rickman. -- Editor.] I reposed myself
   on his protection; and you, my friend, will find, even in your last
   moments, more consolation in the silence of resignation than in the
   murmuring wish of a prayer.

   In every thing which you say in your second letter to John Adams,
   respecting our Rights as Men and Citizens in this World, I am perfectly
   with you. On other points we have to answer to our Creator and not to each
   other. The key of heaven is not in the keeping of any sect, nor ought the
   road to it be obstructed by any. Our relation to each other in this World
   is as Men, and the Man who is a friend to Man and to his rights, let his
   religious opinions be what they may, is a good citizen, to whom I can
   give, as I ought to do, and as every other ought, the right hand of
   fellow-ship, and to none with more hearty good will, my dear friend, than
   to you.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   FEDERAL CITY, January 1, 1803.

   III. PROSECUTION OF THE AGE OF REASON

   [NOTE: "A letter to the Hon. Thomas Erskine, on the Prosecution of Thomas
   Williams for publishing the Age of Reason. By Thomas Paine, Author of
   Common Sense, Rights of Man, etc. With his discourse at the Society of the
   Theophilanthropists. Paris: Printed for the Author." This pamphlet was
   carried through Barrois' English press in Paris, September 1797, and is
   here reprinted from an original copy. The Prosecution (Howells' State
   Trials, vol. 26,) was not technically instituted by the Crown, though in
   collusion with it, a Special Jury being secured. The accusers were the new
   "Society for carrying into effect His Majesty's Proclamation against Vice
   and Immorality." Erskine, who had defended Paine, on his trial for the
   "Rights of Man," and had gained popularity by his successful defence of
   others accused of sedition, was sagaciously retained by the Society, whose
   means were unlimited, while poor Williams sent out the following appeal:

    

   "T. Williams, Bookseller, No. 8 Little Turnstile, Holborn, Being at this
   time under a prosecution at 'common law,' for selling THE AGE OF REASON,
   and not possessing the means of legal defence, hopes he will not be deemed
   obtrusive in making his situation known to the Friends of Liberty, both
   civil and religious. His case, he presumes, requires not a long
   explanation. It is not whether the doctrines of the book above named are
   proper or improper; nor whether the selling a book in the ordinary course
   of business can be considered as an evidence of his own belief; but
   whether a system of prosecution, 'on pretence of religion,' in direct
   opposition to that liberality of sentiment which, to the honor of modem
   times, has been so widely diffused, shall receive encouragement, by being
   weakly opposed. SUBSCRIPTIONS will be received by J. Ashley, shoemaker,
   No. 6 High Holborn; C. Cooper, grocer, New Compton-st., Soho; G.
   Wilkinson, printer, No. 115 Shoreditch; J. Rhynd, printer, Raye-st.,
   Clerkenwell; R. Hodgson. hatter, No. 29 Brook-st., Holbom."

    

   So humble were they who collected their coppers to begin the long war for
   religious liberty against the powerful league whose gold had taken away
   their leader. The defence was undertaken by Stephen Kyd (once prosecuted
   for sedition), the solicitor being John Martin, who served notice on the
   prosecution that it would be "required to produce a certain book described
   in the said indictment to be the Holy Bible." Erskine declared: "No man
   deserves to be on the Rolls of the Court, who dares, as an Attorney, to
   put his name to such a notice." This did not deter Kyd from referring to
   many of the obscene passages in the book which the protectors of morality
   were shielding from criticism. It was not charged by the prosecution that
   there was anything of that kind in Paine's work. Erskine won a victory
   over Williams with some results already described in my introduction to
   "The Age of Reason." -- Editor. (Conway)]

   IV. PROSECUTION OF THE AGE OF REASON

   INTRODUCTION

   IT is a matter of surprise to some people to see Mr. Erskine act as
   counsel for a crown prosecution commenced against the rights of opinion. I
   confess it is none to me, notwithstanding all that Mr. Erskine has said
   before; for it is difficult to know when a lawyer is to be believed: I
   have always observed that Mr. Erskine, when contending as counsel for the
   right of political opinion, frequently took occasions, and those often
   dragged in head and shoulders, to lard, what he called the British
   Constitution, with a great deal of praise. Yet the same Mr. Erskine said
   to me in conversation, "Were government to begin 'de novo' in England,
   they never would establish such a damned absurdity, [it was exactly his
   expression) as this is." Ought I then to be surprised at Mr. Erskine for
   inconsistency?

    

   In this prosecution, Mr. Erskine admits the right of controversy; but says
   that the Christian religion is not to be abused. This is somewhat
   sophistical, because while he admits the right of controversy, he reserves
   the right of calling the controversy abuse: and thus, lawyer-like, undoes
   by one word what he says in the other. I will however in this letter keep
   within the limits he prescribes; he will find here nothing about the
   Christian religion; he will find only a statement of a few cases which
   shew the necessity of examining the books handed to us from the Jews, in
   order to discover if we have not been imposed upon; together with some
   observations on the manner in which the trial of Williams has been
   conducted. If Mr. Erskine denies the right of examining those books, he
   had better profess himself at once an advocate for the establishment of an
   Inquisition, and the re-establishment of the Star-chamber.

   A LETTER TO MR. ERSKINE

   OF all the tyrannies that afflict mankind, tyranny in religion is the
   worst: Every other species of tyranny is limited to the world we live in,
   but this attempts a stride beyond the grave, and seeks to pursue us into
   eternity. It is there and not here, it is to God and not to man, it is to
   a heavenly and not to an earthly tribunal, that we are to account for our
   belief; if then we believe falsely and dishonorably of the Creator, and
   that belief is forced upon us, as far as force can by human laws and human
   tribunals, on whom is the criminality of that belief to fall; on those who
   impose it, or on those on whom it is imposed?

    

   A bookseller of the name of Williams has been prosecuted in London on a
   charge of blasphemy for publishing a book entitled the Age of Reason.
   Blasphemy is a word of vast sound but of equivocal and almost of
   indefinite signification, unless we confine it to the simple idea of
   hurting or injuring the reputation of any one, which was its original
   meaning, As a word, it existed before Christianity existed, being a Greek
   word, or Greek anglofied, as all the etymological dictionaries will show.

   But behold how various and contradictory has been the signification and
   application of this equivocal word: Socrates, who lived more than four
   hundred years before the Christian era, was convicted of blasphemy for
   preaching against the belief of a plurality of gods, and for preaching the
   belief of one god, and was condemned to suffer death by poison; Jesus
   Christ was convicted of blasphemy under the Jewish law, and was crucified.
   Calling Mahomet an imposter would be blasphemy in Turkey; and denying the
   infallibility of the Pope and the Church would be blasphemy at Rome. What
   then is to be understood by this word blasphemy? We see that in the case
   of Socrates truth was condemned as blasphemy. Are we sure that truth is
   not blasphemy in the present day? Woe however be to those who make it so,
   whoever they may be.

   A book called the Bible has been voted by men, and decreed by human laws,
   to be the word of God, and the disbelief of this is called blasphemy. But
   if the Bible be not the word of God, it is the laws and the execution of
   them that is blasphemy, and not the disbelief. Strange stories are told of
   the Creator in that book. He is represented as acting under the influence
   of every human passion, even of the most malignant kind. If these stories
   are false, we err in believing them to be true, and ought not to believe
   them. It is therefore a duty which every man owes to himself, and
   reverentially to his Maker, to ascertain by every possible enquiry whether
   there be a sufficient evidence to believe them or not.

   My own opinion is, decidedly, that the evidence does not warrant the
   belief, and that we sin in forcing that belief upon ourselves and upon
   others. In saying this I have no other object in view than truth. But that
   I may not be accused of resting upon bare assertion, with respect to the
   equivocal state of the Bible, I will produce an example, and I will not
   pick and cull the Bible for the purpose. I will go fairly to the case., I
   will take the first two chapters of Genesis as they stand, and show from
   thence the truth of what I say, that is, that the evidence does not
   warrant the belief that the Bible is the word of God.

   [In the original pamphlet the first two chapters of Genesis are here
   quoted in full.]

   These two chapters are called the Mosaic account of the creation; and we
   are told, nobody knows by whom, that Moses was instructed by God to write
   that account.

   It has happened that every nation of people has been world- makers; and
   each makes the world to begin his own way, as if they had all been brought
   up, as Hudibras says, to the trade. There are hundreds of different
   opinions and traditions how the world began. My business, however, in this
   place, is only with those two chapters.

   I begin then by saying, that those two chapters, instead of containing, as
   has been believed, one continued account of the creation, written by
   Moses, contain two different and contradictory stories of a creation, made
   by two different persons, and written in two different stiles of
   expression. The evidence that shows this is so clear, when attended to
   without prejudice, that did we meet with the same evidence in any Arabic
   or Chinese account of a creation, we should not hesitate in pronouncing it
   a forgery.

   I proceed to distinguish the two stories from each other.

   The first story begins at the first verse of the first chapter, and ends
   at the end of the third verse of the second chapter; for the adverbial
   conjunction, THUS, with which the second chapter begins, (as the reader
   will see,) connects itself to the last verses of the first chapter, and
   those three verses belong to, and make the conclusion of, the first story.

   The second story begins at the fourth verse of the second chapter, and
   ends with that chapter. Those two stories have been confused into one, by
   cutting off the last three verses of the first story, and throwing them to
   the second chapter.

   I go to shew that those stories have been written by two different
   persons.

   From the first verse of the first chapter to the end of the third verse of
   the second chapter, which makes the whole of the first story, the word God
   is used without any epithet or additional word conjoined with it, as the
   reader will see: and this stile of expression is invariably used
   throughout the whole of this story, and is repeated no less than
   thirty-five times, viz. "In the beginning GOD created the heavens and the
   earth, and the spirit of GOD moved on the face of the waters, and GOD
   said, let there be light, and GOD saw the light," etc.

   But immediately from the beginning of the fourth verse of the second
   chapter, where the second story begins, the style of expression is always.
   the Lord God, and this stile of expression is invariably used to the end
   of the chapter, and is repeated eleven times; in the one it is always GOD,
   and never the 'Lord God,' in the other it is always the 'Lord God' and
   never GOD. The first story contains thirty-four verses, and repeats the
   single word GOD thirty-five times. The second story contains twenty-two
   verses, and repeats the compound word 'Lord God' eleven times; this
   difference of stile, so often repeated, and so uniformly continued, shows,
   that those two chapters, containing two different stories, are written by
   different persons; it is the same in all the different editions of the
   Bible, in all the languages I have seen.

   Having thus shown, from the difference of style, that those two chapters,
   divided, as they properly divide themselves, at the end of the third verse
   of the second chapter, are the work of two different persons, I come to
   shew you, from the contradictory matters they contain, that they cannot be
   the work of one person, and are two different stories.

   It is impossible, unless the writer was a lunatic, without memory, that
   one and the same person could say, as is said in i. 27, 28, "So God
   created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and
   female created he them: and God blessed them, and God said unto them, be
   fruitful and multiply, and replentish the earth, and subdue it, and have
   dominion ever the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and every
   living thing that moveth on the face of the earth" -- It is, I say,
   impossible that the same person who said this, could afterwards say, as is
   said in ii. 5, and there was not a man to till the ground; and then
   proceed in verse 7 to give another account of the making a man for the
   first time, and afterwards of the making a woman out of his rib. [The
   original does not signify rib, but the "side" (Feminine). -- Editor
   (Collins)] Again, one and the same person could not write as is written in
   i. 29: "Behold I (God) have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on
   the face of all the earth; and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree
   bearing seed, to you it shall be for meat;" and afterwards say, as is said
   in the second chapter, that the Lord God planted a tree in the midst of a
   garden, and forbade man to eat thereof.

   Again, one and the same person could not say, "Thus the heavens and the
   earth were finished, and all the host of them, and on the seventh day God
   ended all his work which he had made;" and immediately after set the
   Creator to work again, to plant a garden, to make a man and a woman, etc.,
   as done in the second chapter.

   Here are evidently two different stories contradicting each other.
   According to the first, the two sexes, the male and the female, were made
   at the same time. According to the second, they were made at different
   times; the man first, and the woman afterwards. According to the first
   story, they were to have dominion over all the earth. According to the
   second, their dominion was limited to a garden. How large a garden it
   could be that one man and one woman could dress and keep in order, I leave
   to the prosecutor, the judge, the jury, and Mr. Erskine to determine.

   The story of the talking serpent, and its tete-a-tete with Eve; the
   doleful adventure called the Fall of Man; and how he was turned out of
   this fine garden, and how the garden was afterwards locked up and guarded
   by a flaming sword, (If any one can tell what a flaming sword is;) belong
   altogether to the second story. They have no connection with the first
   story. According to the first there was no Eden; no forbidden tree: the
   scene was the Whole earth, and the fruit of all trees were allowed to be
   eaten.

   In giving this example of the strange state of the Bible, it cannot be
   said I have gone out of my way to seek it, for I have taken the beginning
   of the book; nor can it be said I have made more of it than it makes of
   itself. That there are two stories is as visible to the eye, when attended
   to, as that there are two chapters, and that they have been written by
   different persons, nobody knows by whom. If this then is the strange
   condition the beginning of the Bible is in, it leads to a just suspicion
   that the other parts are no better, and consequently it becomes every
   man's duty to examine the case. I have done it for myself, and am
   satisfied that the Bible is 'fabulous'.

   Perhaps I shall be told in the cant-language of the day, as I have often
   been told by the Bishop of Llandaff and others, of the great and laudable
   pains that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the obscure,
   and reconcile the contradictory, or as they say the 'seemingly
   contradictory,' passages of the Bible. It is because the Bible needs such
   an undertaking, that is one of the first causes to suspect it is NOT the
   word of God: this single reflection, when carried home to the mind, is in
   itself a volume.

   What! does not the Creator of the Universe, the Fountain of all Wisdom,
   the Origin of all Science, the Author of all Knowledge, the God of Order
   and of Harmony, know how to write? When we contemplate the vast economy of
   the creation, when we behold the unerring regularity of the visible solar
   system, the perfection with which all its several parts revolve, and by
   corresponding assemblage form a whole; -- when we launch our eye into the
   boundless ocean of space, and see ourselves surrounded by innumerable
   worlds, not one of which varies from its appointed place -- when we trace
   the power of a Creator, from a mite to an elephant, from an atom to an
   universe, -- can we suppose that the mind that could conceive such a
   design, and the power that executed it with incomparable perfection,
   cannot write without inconsistence, or that a book so written can be the
   work of such a power? The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine,
   need no commentator to explain, compound, derange, and re-arrange their
   several parts, to render them intelligible; he can relate a fact, or write
   an essay, without forgetting in one page what he has written in another:
   certainly then, did the God of all perfection condescend to write or
   dictate a book, that book would be as perfect as himself is perfect: The
   Bible is not so, and it is confessedly not so, by the attempts to amend
   it.

   Perhaps I shall be told, that though I have produced one instance, I
   cannot produce another of equal force. One is sufficient to call in
   question the genuineness or authenticity of any book that pretends to be
   the word of God; for such a book would, as before said, be as perfect as
   its author is perfect.

   I will, however, advance only four chapters further into the book of
   Genesis, and produce another example that is sufficient to invalidate the
   story to which it belongs.

   We have all heard of Noah's Flood; and it is impossible to think of the
   whole human race, -- men, women, children, and infants, except one family,
   -- deliberately drowning, without feeling a painful sensation. That heart
   must be a heart of flint that can contemplate such a scene with
   tranquility. There is nothing of the ancient Mythology, nor in the
   religion of any people we know of upon the globe, that records a sentence
   of their God, or of their gods, so tremendously severe and merciless. If
   the story be not true, we blasphemously dishonor God by believing it, and
   still more so, in forcing, by laws and penalties, that belief upon others.
   I go now to show from the face of the story that it carries the evidence
   of not being true.

   I know not if the judge, the jury, and Mr. Erskine, who tried and
   convicted Williams, ever read the Bible or know anything of its contents,
   and therefore I will state the case precisely.

   There was no such people as Jews or Israelites in the time that Noah is
   said to have lived, and consequently there was no such law as that which
   is called the Jewish or Mosaic Law. It is according to the Bible, more
   than six hundred years from the time the flood is said to have happened,
   to the time of Moses, and consequently the time the flood is said to have
   happened was more than six hundred years prior to the Law, called the Law
   of Moses, even admitting Moses to have been the giver of that Law, of
   which there is great cause to doubt.

   We have here two different epochs, or points of time -- that of the flood,
   and that of the Law of Moses -- the former more than six hundred years
   prior to the latter. But the maker of the story of the flood, whoever he
   was, has betrayed himself by blundering, for he has reversed the order of
   the times. He has told the story, as if the Law of Moses was prior to the
   flood for he has made God to say to Noah, Gen. vii. 2, "Of every clean
   beast, thou shalt take unto thee by sevens, male and his female, and of
   beasts that are 'not clean' by two, the male and his female." This is the
   Mosaic Law, and could only be said after that Law was given, not before.
   There was no such thing as beasts clean and unclean in the time of Noah.
   It is no where said they were created so. They were only 'declared' to be
   so, 'as meats,' by the Mosaic Law, and that to the Jews only, and there
   were no such people as Jews in the time of Noah. This is the blundering
   condition in which this strange story stands.

   When we reflect on a sentence so tremendously severe, as that of
   consigning the whole human race, eight persons excepted, to deliberate
   drowning; a sentence, which represents the Creator in a more merciless
   character than any of those whom we call Pagans ever represented the
   Creator to be, under the figure of any of their deities, we ought at least
   to suspend our belief of it, on a comparison of the beneficent character
   of the Creator with the tremendous severity of the sentence; but when we
   see the story told with such an evident contradiction of circumstances, we
   ought to set it down for nothing better than a Jewish fable, told by
   nobody knows whom, and nobody knows when.

   It is a relief to the genuine and sensible soul of man to find the story
   unfounded. It frees us from two painful sensations at once; that of having
   hard thoughts of the Creator, on account of the severity of the sentence;
   and that of sympathizing in the horrid tragedy of a drowning world. He who
   cannot feel the force of what I mean is not, in my estimation, of
   character worthy the name of a human being.

   I have just said there is great cause to doubt, if the law, called the law
   of Moses, was given by Moses; the books called the books of Moses, which
   contain among other things what is called the Mosaic law, are put in front
   of the Bible, in the manner of a constitution, with a history annexed to
   it. Had these books been written by Moses, they would undoubtedly have
   been the oldest books in the Bible, and entitled to be placed first, and
   the law and the history they contain would be frequently referred to in
   the books that follow; but this is not the case. From the time of Othniel,
   the first of the judges, (judges iii. 9,) to the end of the book of
   judges, which contains a period of four hundred and ten years, this law,
   and those books, were not in practice, nor known among the Jews; nor are
   they so much as alluded to throughout the whole of that period. And if the
   reader will examine 2 Kings xx., xxi. and 2 Chron. xxxiv., he will find
   that no such law, nor any such books, were known in the time of the Jewish
   monarchy, and that the Jews were Pagans during the whole of that time, and
   of their judges.

   The first time the law called the law of Moses made its appearance, was in
   the time of Josiah, about a thousand years after Moses was dead; it is
   then said to have been found by accident. The account of this finding, or
   pretended finding, is given 2 Chron. xxxiv. 14-18: "Hilkiah the priest
   found the book of the law of the Lord, given by Moses, and Hilkiah
   answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law
   in the house of the Lord, and Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and
   Shaphan carried the book to the king, and Shaphan told the king, (Josiah,)
   saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book."

   In consequence of this finding, -- which much resembles that of poor
   Chatterton finding manuscript poems of Rowley the Monk in the Cathedral
   Church at Bristol, or the late finding of manuscripts of Shakespeare in an
   old chest, (two well known frauds,) -- Josiah abolished the Pagan religion
   of the Jews, massacred all the Pagan priests, though he himself had been a
   Pagan, as the reader will see in 2 Kings, xxiii., And thus established in
   blood the law that is there called the law of Moses, and instituted a
   Passover in commemoration thereof. The 22d verse, speaking of this
   passover, says, "surely there was not holden such a passover from the days
   of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the Kings of
   Israel, nor the Kings of Judah;" and ver. 25, in speaking of this
   priest-killing Josiah, says, "Like unto him, there was no king before him,
   that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and
   with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him
   arose there any like him." This verse, like the former one, is a general
   declaration against all the preceding kings without exception. It is also
   a declaration against all that reigned after him, of which there were
   four, the whole time of whose reigning make but twenty-two years and six
   months, before the Jews were entirely broken up as a nation and their
   monarchy destroyed. It is therefore evident that the law called the law of
   Moses, of which the Jews talk so much, was promulgated and established
   only in the latter time of the Jewish monarchy; and it is very remarkable,
   that no sooner had they established it than they were a destroyed people,
   as if they were punished of acting an imposition and affixing the name of
   the Lord to it, and massacring their former priests under the pretence of
   religion. The sum of the history of the Jews is this -- they continued to
   be a nation about a thousand years, they then established a law, which
   they called the 'law of the Lord given by Moses,' and were destroyed. This
   is not opinion, but historical evidence.

   Levi the Jew, who has written an answer to the 'Age of Reason,' gives a
   strange account of the Law of Moses. [A Defence of the Old Testament, in a
   series of Letters addressed to Thomas Paine, etc. By David Levi, author of
   Lingm Sacra, Letters to Dr. Priestley, etc. London: 1797. -- Editor.]

   In speaking of the story of the sun and moon standing still, that the
   Israelites might cut the throats of all their enemies, and hang all their
   kings, as told in Joshua x., he says, "There is also another proof of the
   reality of this miracle, which is, the appeal that the author of the book
   of Joshua makes to the book of Jasher: 'Is not this written in the book of
   Jasher? Hence," continues Levi, "it is manifest that the book commonly
   called the book of Jasher existed and was well known at the time the book
   of Joshua was written; and pray, Sir," continues Levi, "what book do you
   think this was? Why no other than the law of Moses." Levi like the Bishop
   of Llandaff, and many other guess-work commentators, either forgets, or
   does not know, what there is in one part of the Bible, when he is giving
   his opinion upon another part.

   I did not, however, expect to find so much ignorance in a Jew, with
   respect to the history of his nation, though I might not be surprised at
   it in a bishop. If Levi will look into the account given in 2 Sam. i.
   15-18, of the Amalekite slaying Saul, and bringing the crown and bracelets
   to David, he will find the following recital: "And David called one of the
   young men, and said, go near and fall upon him (the Amalekite,) and he
   smote him that he died": "and David lamented with this lamentation over
   Saul and over Jonathan his son; also he bade them teach the children the
   use of the bow; -- behold it is written in the book of Jasher." If the
   book of Jasher were what Levi calls it, the law of Moses, written by
   Moses, it is not possible that any thing that David said or did could be
   written in that law, since Moses died more than five hundred years before
   David was born; and, on the other hand, admitting the book of Jasher to be
   the law called the law of Moses, that law must have been written more than
   five hundred years after Moses was dead, or it could not relate anything
   said or done by David. Levi may take which of these cases he pleaseth, for
   both are against him.

   I am not going in the course of this letter to write a commentary on the
   Bible. The two instances I have produced, and which are taken from the
   beginning of the Bible, shew the necessity of examining it. It is a book
   that has been read more, and examined less, than any book that ever
   existed; Had it come to us as an Arabic or Chinese book, and said to have
   been a sacred book by the people from whom it came, no apology would have
   been made for the confused and disorderly state it is in. The tales it
   relates of the Creator would have been censured, and our pity excited for
   those who believed them. We should have vindicated the goodness of God
   against such a book, and preached up the disbelief of it out of reverence
   to him. Why then do we not act as honorably by the Creator in the one case
   as we would, do in the other? As a Chinese book we would have examined it;
   ought we not then to examine it as a Jewish book? The Chinese are a people
   who have all the appearance of far greater antiquity than the Jews, and in
   point of permanency there is no comparison. They are also a people of mild
   manners and of good morals, except where they have been corrupted by
   European commerce. Yet we take the word of a restless bloody-minded
   people, as the Jews of Palestine were, when we would reject the same
   authority from a better people. We ought to see it is habit and prejudice
   that have prevented people from examining the Bible. Those of the Church
   of England call it holy, because the Jews called it so, and because custom
   and certain Acts of Parliament call it so, and they read it from custom.
   Dissenters read it for the purpose of doctrinal controversy, and are very
   fertile in discoveries and inventions. But none of them read it for the
   pure purpose of information, and of rendering justice to the Creator, by
   examining if the evidence it contains warrants the belief of its being
   what it is called. Instead of doing this, they take it blindfolded, and
   will have it to be the word of God whether it be so or not. For my own
   part, my belief in the perfection of the Deity will not permit me to
   believe that a book so manifestly obscure, disorderly, and contradictory
   can be his work. I can write a better book myself. This disbelief in me
   proceeds from my belief in the Creator. I cannot pin my faith upon the say
   so of Hilkiah the priest, who said he found it, or any part of it, nor
   upon Sha han the scribe, nor upon any priest nor any scribe, or man of the
   law of the present day.

   As to Acts of Parliament, there are some that say there are witches and
   wizards; and the persons who made those acts, (it was in the time of James
   I.,) made also some acts which call the Bible the holy Scriptures, or word
   of God. But acts of parliament decide nothing with respect to God; and as
   these acts of parliament makers were wrong with respect to witches and
   wizards, they may also be wrong with respect to the book in question. It
   is, therefore, necessary that the book be examined; it is our duty to
   examine it; and to suppress the right of examination is sinful in any
   government, or in any judge or jury. The Bible makes God to say to Moses,
   Deut. vii. 2, "And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee,
   thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no
   covenant with them, ner shew mercy unto them." Not all the priests, nor
   scribes, nor tribunals in the world, nor all the authority of man, shall
   make me believe that God ever gave such a 'Robesperian precept' as that of
   showing 'no mercy;' and consequently it is impossible that I, or any
   person who believes as reverentially of the Creator as I do, can believe
   such a book to be the word of God.

   There have been, and still are, those, who, whilst they 'profess' to
   believe the Bible to be the word of God, affect to turn it into ridicule.
   Taking their profession and conduct together, they act blasphemously;
   because they act as if God himself was not to be believed. The case is
   exceedingly different with respect to the 'Age of Reason.' That book is
   written to shew, from the bible itself, that there is abundant matter to
   suspect it is not the word of God, and that we have been imposed upon,
   first by Jews, and after. wards by priests and commentators.

   Not one of those who have attempted to write answers to the 'Age of
   Reason,' have taken the ground upon which only an answer could be written.
   The case in question is not upon any, point of doctrine, but altogether
   upon a matter of fact. Is the book called the Bible the word of God, or is
   it not? If it can be proved to be so, it ought to be believed as such; if
   not, it ought not to be believed as such. This is the true state of the
   case. The 'Age of Reason' produces evidence to shew, and I have in this
   letter produced additional evidence, that it is not the word of God. Those
   who take the contrary side, should prove that it is. But this they have
   not done, nor attempted to do, and consequently they have done nothing to
   the purpose.

   The prosecutors of Williams have shrunk from the point, as the answerers
   to the 'Age of Reason,' have done. They have availed themselves of
   prejudice instead of proof. If a writing was produced in a court of
   judicature, said to be the writing of a certain person, and upon the
   reality or non-reality of which some matter at issue depended, the point
   to be proved would be, that such writing was the writing of such person,
   Or if the issue depended upon certain words, which some certain person was
   said to have spoken, the point to be proved would be, that such words were
   spoken by such person; and Mr. Erskine would contend the case upon this
   ground. A certain book is said to be the word of God. What is the proof
   that it is so? for upon this the whole depends; and if it cannot be proved
   to be so, the prosecution fails for want of evidence.

   The prosecution against Williams charges him with publishing a book,
   entitled The 'Age of Reason,' which, it says, is an impious blasphemous
   pamphlet, tending to ridicule and bring into contempt the Holy Scriptures.
   Nothing is more easy than to find abusive words, and English prosecutions
   are famous for this species of vulgarity. The charge however is
   sophistical; for the charge, as growing out of the pamphlet should have
   stated, not as it now states, to ridicule and bring into contempt the holy
   scriptures, but to shew, that the book called the holy scriptures are not
   the holy scriptures. It is one thing if I ridicule a work as being written
   by a certain person; but it is quite a different thing if I write to prove
   that such work was not written by such person. In the first case, I attack
   the person through the work; in the other case, I defend the honor of the
   person against the work. This is what the 'Age of Reason' does, and
   consequently the charge in the indictment is sophistically stated. Every
   one will admit, that if the Bible be 'not the word of God,' we err in
   believing it to be his word, and ought not to believe it. Certainly then,
   the ground the prosecution should take would be to prove that the Bible is
   in fact what it is called. But this the prosecution has not done, and
   cannot do.

   In all cases the prior fact must be proved, before the subsequent facts
   can be admitted in evidence. In a prosecution for adultery, the fact of
   marriage, which is the prior fact, must be proved, before the facts to
   prove adultery can be received. If the fact of marriage cannot be proved,
   adultery cannot be proved; and if the prosecution cannot prove the Bible
   to be the word of God, the charge of blasphemy is visionary and
   groundless.

   In Turkey they might prove, if the case happened, that a certain book was
   bought of a certain bookseller, and that the said book was written against
   the koran. In Spain and Portugal they might prove that a certain book was
   bought of a certain bookseller, and that the said book was written against
   the infallibility of the Pope. Under the ancient Mythology they might have
   proved that a certain writing was bought of a certain person, and that the
   said writing was against the belief of a plurality of gods, and in the
   support of the belief of one God: Socrates was condemned for a work of
   this kind.

   All these are but subsequent facts, and amount to nothing, unless the
   prior facts be proved. The prior fact, with respect to the first case is,
   Is the koran the word of God? With respect to the second, Is the
   infallibility of the Pope a truth? With respect to the third, Is the
   belief of a plurality of gods a true belief? And in like manner with
   respect to the present prosecution, Is the book called the 'Bible' the
   word of God? If the present prosecution prove no more than could be proved
   in any or all of these cases, it proves only as they do, or as an
   Inquisition would prove; and in this view of the case, the prosecutors
   ought at least to leave off reviling that infernal institution, the
   Inquisition. The prosecution however, though it may injure the individual,
   may promote the cause of truth; because the manner in which it has been
   conducted appears a confession to the world that there is no evidence to
   prove that the 'Bible' is the word of God. On what authority then do we
   believe the many strange stories that the Bible tells of God?

   This prosecution has been carried on through the medium of what is called
   a special jury, and the whole of a special jury is nominated by the master
   of the Crown office. Mr. Erskine vaunts himself upon the bill he brought
   into parliament with respect to trials for what the government party calls
   libels. But if in crown prosecutions the master of the Crown-office is to
   continue to appoint the whole special jury, which he does by nominating
   the forty-eight persons from which the solicitor of each party is to
   strike out twelve, Mr. Erskine's bill is only vapor and smoke. The root of
   the grievance lies in the manner of forming the jury, and to this Mr.
   Erskine's bill applies no remedy.

   When the trial of Williams came on, only eleven of the special jurymen
   appeared, and the trial was adjourned. In cases where the whole number do
   not appear, it is customary to make up the deficiency by taking jurymen
   from persons present in court. This in the law term is called a 'Tales.'
   Why was not this done in this case? Reason will suggest, that they did not
   choose to depend on a man accidentally taken. When the trial recommenced,
   the whole of the special jury appeared, and Williams was convicted: it is
   folly to contend a cause where the whole jury is nominated by one of the
   parties. I will relate a recent case that explains a great deal with
   respect to special juries in crown prosecutions.

   On the trial of Lambert and others, printers and proprietors of the
   'Horning, Chronicle,' for a libel, a special jury was struck, on the
   prayer of the Attorney-General, who used to be called 'Diabolus Regis,' or
   King's Devil. Only seven or eight of the special jury appeared, and the
   Attorney-General not praying a Tales, the trial stood over to a future
   day; when it was to be brought on a second time, the Attorney-General
   prayed for a new special jury, but as this was not admissible, the
   original special jury was summoned. Only eight of them appeared, on which
   the Attorney-General said, "As I cannot, on a second trial, have a special
   jury, I will pray a Tales." Four persons were then taken from the persons
   present in court, and added to the eight special jurymen. The jury went
   out at two o'clock to consult on their verdict, and the judge (Kenyon)
   [The judge before whom Paine, in his absence, was tried Dec. 18, 1792, for
   writing Part II. of Rights of Man." -- Editor.] understanding they were
   divided, and likely to be some time in making up their minds, retired from
   the bench and went home. At seven, the jury went, attended by an officer
   of the court, to the judge's house, and delivered a verdict, "Guilty of
   publishing, but with no malicious intention." The judge said, "I cannot
   record this verdict: it is no verdict at all." The jury withdrew, and
   after sitting in consultation till five in the morning, brought in a
   verdict, Not Guilty. Would this have been the case, had they been all
   special jurymen nominated by the Master of the Crown-office? This is one
   of the cases that ought to open the eyes of people with respect to the
   manner of forming special juries.

   On the trial of Williams, the judge prevented the counsel for the
   defendant proceeding in the defence. The prosecution hid selected a number
   of passages from the 'Age of Reason' and inserted them in the indictment.
   The defending counsel was selecting other passages to shew that the
   passage's in the indictment were conclusions drawn from premises, and
   unfairly separated therefrom in the indictment. The judge said, he did not
   know how to act; meaning thereby whether to let the counsel proceed in the
   defence or not; and asked the jury if they wished to hear the passages
   read which the defending counsel had selected. The jury said No, and the
   defending counsel was in consequence silenced. Mr. Erskine then,
   (Falstaff-like,) having all the field to himself, and no enemy at hand,
   laid about him most heroically, and the jury found the defendant guilty. I
   know not if Mr. Erskine ran out of court and hallooed, Huzza for the Bible
   and the trial by jury!

   Robespierre caused a decree to be passed during the trial of Brissot and
   others, that after a trial had lasted three days, (the whole of which
   time, in the case of Brissot, was taken up by the prosecuting party,) the
   judge should ask the jury (who were then a packed jury) if they were
   satisfied? If the jury said YES, the trial ended, and the jury proceeded
   to give their verdict, without hearing the defence of the accused party.
   It needs no depth of wisdom to make an application of this case.

   I will now state a case to shew that the trial of Williams is not a trial
   according to Kenyon's own explanation of law.

   On a late trial in London (Selthens versus Hoossman) on a policy of
   insurance, one of the jurymen, Mr. Dunnage, after hearing one side of the
   case, and without hearing the other side, got up and said, 'it was as
   legal a policy of insurance as ever was written.' The judge, who was the
   same as presided on the trial of Williams, replied, 'that it was a great
   misfortune when any gentleman of the jury makes up his mind on a cause
   before it was finished.' Mr. Erskine, who in that cause was counsel for
   the defendant, (in this he was against the defendant,) cried out,' it is
   worse than a misfortune, it is a fault.' The judge, in his address to the
   jury in summing up the evidence, expatiated upon, and explained the parts
   which the law assigned to the counsel on each side, to the witnesses, and
   to the judge, and said, "When all this was done, AND NOT UNTIL THEN, it
   was the business of the jury to declare what the justice of the case was;
   and that it was extremely rash and impudent in any man to draw a
   conclusion before all the premises were laid before them upon which that
   conclusion was to be grounded." According then to Kenyon's own doctrine,
   the trial of Williams is an irregular trial, the verdict an irregular
   verdict, and as such is not recordable.

   As to the special juries, they are but modern; and were instituted for the
   purpose of determining cases at law between merchants; because, as the
   method of keeping merchants' accounts differs from that of common
   tradesmen, and their business, by lying much in foreign bills of exchange,
   insurance, etc., is of a different description to that of common
   tradesmen, it might happen that a common jury might not be competent to
   form a judgment. The law that instituted special juries, makes it
   necessary that the jurors be merchants, or of the degree of 'squires.' A
   special jury in London is generally composed of merchants; and in the
   country, of men called country squires, that is, fox-hunters, or men
   qualified to hunt foxes. The one may decide very well upon a case of
   pounds, shillings, and pence, or of the counting-house: and the other of
   the jockey-club or the chase. But who would not laugh, that because such
   men can decide such cases, they can also be jurors upon theology? Talk
   with some London merchants about scripture, and they will understand you
   mean scrip, and tell you how much it is worth at the Stock Exchange. Ask
   them about Theology, and they will say they know of no such gentleman upon
   'Change. Tell some country squires of the Sun and moon standing still, the
   one on the top of a hill, the other in a valley, and they will swear it is
   a lie of one's own making, Tell them that God Almighty ordered a man to
   make a cake, and bake it with a t--d and eat it, and they will say it is
   one of Dean Swift's blackguard stories. Tell them it is in the Bible, and
   they will lay a bowl of punch it is not, and leave it to the parson of the
   parish to decide. Ask them also about Theology, and they will say, they
   know of no such a one on the turf. An appeal to such juries serves to
   bring the Bible into more ridicule than anything the author of the Age of
   Reason has written; and the manner in which the trial has been conducted
   shows that the prosecutor dares not come to the point, nor meet the
   defence of the defendant. But all other cases apart, on what grounds of
   right, otherwise than on the right assumed by an Inquisition, do such
   prosecutions stand? Religion is a private affair between every man and his
   Maker, and no tribunal or third party has a right to interfere between
   them. It is not properly a thing of this world; it is only practiced in
   this world; but its object is in a future world; and it is not otherwise
   an object of just laws than for the purpose of protecting the equal rights
   of all, however various their belief may be. If one man chose to believe
   the book called the Bible to be the word of God, and another, from the
   convinced idea of the purity and perfection of God compared with the
   contradictions the book contains -- from the lasciviousness of some of its
   stories, like that of Lot getting drunk and debauching his two daughters,
   which is not spoken of as a crime, and for which the most absurd apologies
   are made -- from the immorality of some of its precepts, like that of
   showing no mercy -- and from the total want of evidence on the case, --
   thinks he ought not to believe it to be the word of God, each of them has
   an equal right; and if the one has a right to give his reasons for
   believing it to be so, the other has an equal right to give his reasons
   for believing the contrary, Any thing that goes beyond this rule is an
   Inquisition. Mr. Erskine talks of his moral education: Mr. Erskine is very
   little acquainted with theological subjects, if he does not know there is
   such a thing as a 'sincere' and 'religious' belief that the Bible is not
   the word of God. This is my belief; it is the belief of thousands far more
   learned than Mr. Erskine; and it is a belief that is every day increasing.
   It is not infidelity, as Mr. Erskine profanely and abusively calls it; it
   is the direct reverse of infidelity. It is a pure religious belief,
   founded on the idea of the perfection of the Creator. If the Bible be the
   word of God, it needs not the wretched aid of prosecutions to support it,
   and you might with as much propriety make a law to protect the sunshine as
   to protect the Bible. Is the Bible like the sun, or the work of God? We
   see that God takes good care of the creation he has made. He suffers no
   part of it to be extinguished: and he will take the same care of his word,
   if he ever gave one. But men ought to be reverentially careful and
   suspicious how they ascribe books to him as his word, which from this
   confused condition would dishonor a common scribbler, and against which
   there is abundant evidence, and every cause to suspect imposition. Leave
   the Bible to itself. God will take care of it if he has any thing to do
   with it, as he takes care of the sun and the moon, which need not your
   laws for their better protection. As the two instances I have produced in
   the beginning of this letter, from the book of Genesis, -- the one
   respecting the account called the Mosaic account of the Creation, the
   other of the Flood, -- sufficiently shew the necessity of examining the
   Bible, in order to ascertain what degree of evidence there is for
   receiving or rejecting it as a sacred book, I shall not add more upon that
   subject; but in order to shew Mr. Erskine that there are religious
   establishments for public worship which make no profession of faith of the
   books called holy scriptures, nor admit of priests, I will conclude with
   an account of a society lately begun in Paris, and which is very rapidly
   extending itself.

   The society takes the name of Theophilantropes, which would be rendered in
   English by the word Theophilanthropists, a word compounded of three Greek
   words, signifying God, Love, and Man. The explanation given to this word
   is 'Lovers of God and Man,' or 'Adorers of God and Friends of Man,'
   adorateurs de dieu et amis des hommes. The society proposes to publish
   each year a volume, entitled 'Annee Religieuse des Thdophilantropes,' Year
   Religious of the Theophilanthropists. The first volume is just published,
   entitled:

   RELIGIOUS YEAR OF THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS;
   or
   ADORERS OF GOD AND FRIENDS OF MAN

   Being a collection of the discourses, lectures, hymns, and canticles, for
   all the religious and moral festivals of the Theophilanthropists during
   the course of the year, whether in their public temples or in their
   private families, published by the author of the Manual of the
   Theophilanthropists.

   The volume of this year, which is the first, contains 214 pages of
   duodecimo. The following is the table of contents:

   Adorateurs.

   Upon the physical proofs of his existence.

   Gave us light.

   INTRODUCTION

   ENTITLED: PRECISE HISTORY OF THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS

   "Towards the month of Vendemiaire, of the year 5, (Sept. 1796,) there
   appeared at Paris, a small work entitled, Manual of the Thdoantropophiles,
   since called, for the sake of easier pronunciation, Theophilantropes,
   (Theophilanthropists,) published by C------. [Chemin-Dupontes. -- Editor.]

    

   "The worship set forth in this Manual, of which the origin is from the
   beginning of the world, was then professed by some families in the silence
   of domestic life. But no sooner was the Manual published, than some
   persons, respectable for their knowledge and their manners, saw, in the
   formation of a Society open to the public, an easy method of spreading
   moral religion, and of leading by degrees great numbers to the knowledge
   thereof, who appear to have forgotten it. This consideration ought of
   itself not to leave indifferent those persons who know that morality and
   religion, which is the most solid support thereof, are necessary to the
   maintenance of society, as well as to the happiness of the individual.
   These considerations determined the families of the Theophilanthropists to
   unite publicly for the exercise of their worship.

   "The first society of this kind opened in the month of Nivose, year 5,
   (Jan. 1797,) in the street Denis, No. 34, corner of Lombard-street. The
   care of conducting this society was undertaken by five fathers of
   families. They adopted the Manual of the Theophilanthropists. They agreed
   to hold their days of public worship on the days corresponding to Sundays,
   but without making this a hindrance to other Societies to choose such
   other day as they thought more convenient. Soon after this, more Societies
   were opened, of which some celebrate on the decadi, (tenth day,) and
   others on the Sunday. It was also resolved that the committee should meet
   one hour each week for the purpose of preparing or examining the
   discourses and lectures proposed for the next general assembly; that the
   general assemblies should be called Fetes (festivals) religious and moral;
   that those festivals should be conducted in principle and form, in a
   manner, as not to be considered as the festivals of an exclusive worship;
   and that in recalling those who might not be attached to any particular
   worship, those festivals might also be attended as moral exercises by
   disciples of every sect, and consequently avoid, by scrupulous care,
   everything that might make the Society appear under the name of a sect.
   The Society adopts neither rites nor priesthood, and it will never lose
   sight of the resolution not to advance any thing, as a Society,
   inconvenient to any sect or sects, in any time or country, and under any
   government.

   "It will be seen, that It is so much the more easy for the Society to keep
   within this circle, because that the dogmas of the Theophilanthropists are
   those upon which all the sects have agreed, that their moral is that upon
   which there has never been the least dissent; and that the name they have
   taken expresses the double end of all the sects, that of leading to the
   'adoration of God and love of man.'

   "The Theophilanthropists do not call themselves the disciples of such or
   such a man. They avail themselves of the wise precepts that have been
   transmitted by writers of all countries and in all ages. The reader will
   find in the discourses, lectures, hymns, and canticles, which the
   Theophilanthropists have adopted for their religious and moral festivals,
   and which they present under the title of Annee Religiouse, extracts from
   moralists, ancient and modern, divested of maxims too severe, or too
   loosely conceived, or contrary to piety, whether towards God or towards
   man."

   Next follow the dogmas of the Theophilanthropists, or things they profess
   to believe. These are but two, and are thus expressed, 'les
   Theophilantropes croient 'a l'existence de Dieu, et a l'immortalite de
   l'ame.' The Theophilanthropists believe in the existence of God, and the
   immortality of the soul.

   The Manual of the Theophilanthropists, a small volume of sixty pages,
   duodecimo, is published separately, as is also their catechism, which is
   of the same size. The principles of the Theophilanthropists are the same
   as those published in the first part of the 'Age of Reason' in 1793, and
   in the second part in 1795. The Theophilanthropists, as a Society, are
   silent upon all the things they do not profess to believe, as the
   sacredness of the books called the Bible, etc. They profess the
   immortality of the soul, but they are silent on the immortality of the
   body, or that which the church of England calls the resurrection. The
   author of the 'Age of Reason' gives reasons for every thing he
   disbelieves, as well as for those he believes; and where this cannot be
   done with safety, the government is a despotism, and the church an
   Inquisition.

   It is more than three years since the first part of the Age of Reason was
   published, and more than a year and a half since the publication of the
   second part: the Bishop of Llandaff undertook to write an answer to the
   second part; and it, was not until after it was known that the author of
   the Age of Reason would reply to the bishop, that the prosecution against
   the book was set on foot; and which is said to be carried on by some
   clergy of the English Church. If the bishop is one of them, and the object
   be to prevent an exposure of the numerous and gross errors he has
   committed in his work, (and which he wrote when report said that Thomas
   Paine was dead,) it is a confession that be feels the weakness of his
   cause, and finds himself unable to maintain it. In this case he has given
   me a triumph I did not seek, and Mr. Erskind, the herald of the
   prosecution, has proclaimed it.

   THOMAS PAINE.
