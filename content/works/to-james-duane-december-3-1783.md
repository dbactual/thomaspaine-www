   To James Duane  December 3, 1783

   MY DEAR SIR:

   As you and I have had conversations on the subject which this letter
   alludes to, and as your long continuance in Congress enables you to know
   how serviceable as well as how sincere and disinterested my public conduct
   has been, I should be glad of an opportunity, before I leave town, which
   will be in two or three days, to converse a little intimately with you on
   some affairs relative to myself.

   You know how I am circumstanced with Congress. My own opinion is, that
   notwithstanding the wishes and endeavors of General Washington and many
   other friends, that nothing will be done, as it requires a concurrence of
   nine States, and there are one or two that will oppose everything relative
   to myself.

   It has ever been my wish and intention to close the scene with a History
   of the Revolution, but the conduct of Congress puts it out of my power,
   and I have but two resources left, the one, is, to apply to the States
   individually, the other is, to go to Europe, for as matters are now
   circumstanced it is impossible I can continue here. Neither do I think
   there is an instance to be produced in the world of an individual
   (situated as I was) acting towards a country as I have done for years
   together and that country acting in return as this country has done by me.
   I am truly ashamed of it on her own account and conceal it out of kindness
   to her infant reputation.

   But there is one thing I wish to speak freely to you upon, which is, that
   I have not yet a fixed residence in any state. Pennsylvania I have but
   little inclination to as it is the seat neither of science nor society.
   S[outh] Carolina is too remote as my wish is to be as central as I
   conveniently can. I should prefer a residence in the State of N[ew] Y[ork]
   to any other place, and as the State will have houses or situations to
   dispose of, she will have an opportunity of remembering a friend who has
   not yet been to America the expense of a private soldier.

   Perhaps was any one state to make a beginning, it might have an effect on
   others, and as to myself, I candidly tell you I am tired of having no
   home, especially in a country where, everybody will allow, I have deserved
   one.

   If you will take an opportunity of talking confidentially with two or
   three friends on this subject, and communicate to me your sentiments
   thereon, I shall be much obliged to you.

   I am Dear Sir, Your obedient, humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   At Mrs. Hamilton's opposite Fraunces Tavern.
