   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.
   
   uxembourg 14th Vendemiaire, old stile Oct 4th

   Dear Sir &mdash;  I thank you for your very friendly and affectionate letter of 
   the 18th of Sep. which I did not receive till this morning  - It
   has relieved my mind from a load of disquietude. You will easily supposed
   that if the information I received had been exact, my situation was
   without hope. I had, in that case, neither section, department nor Country,
   to reclaim me; but that is not all, I felt a poignancy of grief, in having
   the least reason to suppose that America had so soon forgotten me who had
   never forgotten her.

   Mr. Labonadaire in a note of yesterday directed me to write to the
   Convention. As I suppose this measure has been taken in Concert with you
   I have requested him to shew you the letter, of which he will make a
   translation to accompany the Original.

   (I cannot see what motive can induce them to keep me in prison. It will
   gratify the English Government and afflict the friends I have in America.
   The supporters of the system of Terror might apprehend that if I was in
   liberty and in America I should publish the history of their Crimes, but
   the present persons who have overset that immoral System ought to have no
   such apprehension. On the contrary, they ought to consider me as one of
   themselves, at least as one of their friends. Had I been an insignificant
   character I had not been in arrestation. It was the literary and
   philosophical reputation I had gained in the world that made them my
   Enemies; and I am the victim of the principles and if I may be permitted
   to say it, of the talents, that procured me the esteem of America. My
   character is the *secret* of my arrestation.)

   If the letter I have written be not covered by other authority than my own
   it will have no effect, for they already know all that I can say. On what
   ground do they pretend to deprive America of the service of any of her
   Citizens without assigning a Cause, or only the flimsy one of my being
   born in England? Gates, were he here, might be arrested on the same
   pretence, and he and Burgoyne be confounded together.

   (It is difficult for me to give an opinion, but among other things that
   occur to me I think that if you were to say that as it will be necessary
   to you to inform the Government of America of my situation that you require an
   explanation with the Committee upon that subject, that you are induced to
   make this proposal not only out of esteem for the character of the person
   who is the personal object of it but because you know that his
   arrestation will distress the Americans and the more so as it will appear
   to them to be contrary to their Ideas of Civil and National Justice, it
   might perhaps have some effect. If the Committee will do nothing it will be 
   necessary to bring this matter openly before the Convention, for I do most 
   sincerely assure you from the observations that I hear and I suppose the same 
   are made in other places, that the character of America lies under some
   reproach. All the world knows that I have served her, and they see that I am 
   still in prison, and you know that when people can form a conclusion upon a
   simple fact, they trouble not themselves about reasons. I had rather that
   America cleared herself of all suspicion of ingratitude though I were to
   be the victim.

   You advise me to have patience, but I am fully persuaded that the longer I
   continue in prison the more difficult will be my liberation. There are two
   reasons for this, the one is that the present Committee by continuing so
   long my imprisonment will naturally suppose that my mind will be soured
   against them, as it was against those who put me in, and they will
   continue my imprisonment from the same apprehensions as the former
   Committee did. The other reason is, that it is now about two months since
   your arrival and I am still in prison. They will explain this into an
   indifference upon my fate that will encourage them to continue my
   imprisonment. When I hear some people say that it is the Government of America 
   that now keeps me in prison by not reclaiming me, and then pour forth a volley 
   of execrations against her, I know not how to answer them otherwise than by a
   direct denial which they do not appear to believe. You will easily conclude that 
   whatever relates to imprisonments and
   liberations makes a topic of prison conversation, and as I am now the
   oldest inhabitant within these walls, except two or three, I am often the
   subject of their remarks, because from the continuance of my imprisonment
   they augur ill to themselves. &mdash; You see I write you everything that occurs
   to me, and) I conclude with thanking you again for your very friendly and
   affectionate letter, and am with great respect -

   your's affectionately

   THOMAS PAINE

   Today is the anniversary of the action of German Town. Your letter has
   enabled me to contradict the observations before mentioned.
