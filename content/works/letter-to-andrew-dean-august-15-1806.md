   [The original manuscript of this letter is in the library of Harvard
   University - ed.]

   I received your friendly letter, for which I am obliged to you. It is
   three weeks ago today (Sunday, August fifteenth), that I was struck with a
   fit of apoplexy, that deprived me of all sense and motion. I had neither
   pulse nor breathing, and the people about me supposed me dead. I had felt
   exceedingly well that day, and had just taken a slice of bread and butter
   for supper, and was going to bed.

   The fit took me on the stairs, as suddenly as if I had been shot through
   the head; and I got so very much hurt by the fall, that I have not been
   able to get in and out of bed since that day, otherwise than being lifted
   out in a blanket, by two persons; yet all this while my mental faculties
   have remained as perfect a I ever enjoyed them.

   I consider the scene I have passed through as an experiment on dying, and
   I find that death has no terrors for me. As to the people called
   Christians, they have no evidence that their religion is true. There is no
   more proof that the Bible is the Word of God, than that the Koran of
   Mahomet is the Word of God. It is education makes all the difference. Man,
   before he begins to think for himself, is as much the child of habits in
   Creeds as he is in plowing and sowing. Yet creeds, like opinions, prove
   nothing.

   Where is the evidence that the person called Jesus Christ is the begotten
   Son of God? The case admits not of evidence either to our senses or our
   mental faculties: neither has God given to man any talent by which such a
   thing is comprehensible.

   It cannot therefore be an object for faith to act upon, for faith is
   nothing more than an assent the mind gives to something it sees cause to
   believe is fact. But priests, preachers, and fanatics, put imagination in
   the place of
   faith, and it is the nature of the imagination to believe without
   evidence.

   If Joseph the carpenter dreamed (as the book of Matthew (i) says he did),
   that his betrothed wife, Mary, was with child by the Holy Ghost, and that
   an angel told him so, I am not obliged to put faith in his dreams; nor do
   I put any, for I put no faith in my own dreams, and I should be weak and
   foolish indeed to put faith in the dreams of others.

   The Christian religion is derogatory to the Creator in all its articles.
   It puts the Creator in an inferior point of view, and places the Christian
   devil above Him. It is he, according to the absurd story in Genesis, that
   outwits the Creator in the Garden of Eden, and steals from Him His
   favorite creature, man, and at last obliges Him to beget a son, and put
   that son to death, to get man back again; and this the priests of the
   Christian religion call redemption.

   Christian authors exclaim against the practice of offering up human
   sacrifices, which, they say, is done in some countries; and those authors
   make those exclamations without ever reflecting that their own doctrine of
   salvation is founded on a human sacrifice. They are saved, they say, by
   the blood of Christ. The Christian religion begins with a dream and ends
   with a murder.

   As I am now well enough to sit up some hours in the day, though not well
   enough to get up without help, I employ myself as I have always done, in
   endeavoring to bring man to the right use of the reason that God has given
   him, and to direct his mind immediately to his Creator, and not to
   fanciful secondary beings called mediators, as if God was superannuated or
   ferocious.

   As to the book called the Bible, it is blasphemy to call it the Word of
   God. It is a book of lies and contradictions, and a history of bad times
   and bad men. There are but a few good characters in the whole book. The
   fable of Christ and his twelve apostles, which is a parody on the sun and
   the twelve signs of the zodiac, copied from the ancient religions of the
   eastern world, is the least hurtful part.

   Everything told of Christ has reference to the sun. His reported
   resurrection is at sunrise, and that on the first day of the week; that
   is, on the day anciently dedicated to the sun, and from thence called
   Sunday - in Latin Dies Solis, the day of the sun; and the next day,
   Monday, is Moon-day. But there is no room in a letter to explain these
   things.

   While man keeps to the belief of one God, his reason unites with his
   creed. He is not shocked with contradictions and horrid stories. His bible
   is the heavens and the earth. He beholds his Creator in all His works, and
   everything he beholds inspires him with reverence and gratitude. From the
   goodness of God to all, he learns his duty to his fellow-man, and stands
   self-reproved when he transgresses it. Such a man is no persecutor.

   But when he multiplies his creed with imaginary things, of which he can
   have neither evidence nor conception, such as the tale of the Garden of
   Eden, the Talking Serpent, the Fall of Man, the Dreams of Joseph the
   Carpenter, the
   pretended Resurrection and Ascension, of which there is even no historical
   relation - for no historian of those times mentions such a thing - he gets
   into the pathless region of confusion, and turns either fanatic or
   hypocrite. He forces his mind, and pretends to believe what he does not
   believe. This is in general the case with the Methodists. Their religion
   is
   all creed and no morals.

   I have now, my friend, given you a facsimile of my mind on the subject of
   religion and creeds, and my wish is, that you make this letter as publicly
   known as you find opportunities of doing.

   Yours, in friendship,

   Thomas Paine

   New York, August 15, 1806
