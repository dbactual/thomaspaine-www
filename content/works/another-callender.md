   Another Callender &mdash; THOMAS TURNER OF VIRGINIA &mdash; No. I
   
   from the *American Citizen*, July 23 & 24, 1805.

   Federalism and blackguardism are synonimous terms. A man of Virginia who
   signs himself *Thomas Turner* (if any body knows him) has written a letter
   to some nobody or other in Massachusetts (if any body knows such a person)
   for the purpose of defaming Mr. Jefferson. The letter has been published
   in that repository of filth, the *Repertory*, printed somewhere in the
   federal purlieus of Yanky town.

   As I sometimes amuse myself with dissecting impostors and hypocrites and
   putting the parts together again in their proper form, I have thrown away
   an hour or two, having nothing else at that time to do, in examining the
   component parts of this putrid production of Thomas Turner.

   There is not a worse character in life than that of a mischief-making
   black hearted man. It is a disposition that leads to every thing that
   disturbs the peace of society. It works under ground like a mole, and
   having thrown up its little mole-hills of dirt, blows them with its
   pestifrous breath into mountains. This is evidently the character of this
   co-partner of Callender, Thomas Turner. Who he is the Lord knows, for his
   name is not known in the list of patriots. If one may hazard a guess at
   him from the jaundiced complexion of his letter, and the circumstances of
   the case, he is some petty-fogging attorney like that hypocritical dabbler
   in dirt *Hulbert*, of Sheffield, Massachusetts, and that they are
   correspondents, or in other words, *two skunks who stink in concert*; for
   Hulbert's speech, and Turner's letter are alike.

   I will now examine the charges he brings in his letter against Mr.
   Jefferson, and shew, that while they prove the vile disposition of the
   writer, they amount to nothing against Mr. Jefferson, but on the contrary
   add to the opinion the public have of his integrity. The first charge is
   as follows:

   "At the time Petersburgh (Virginia) was occupied by the *British troops*
   under the command of the *generals Phillips and Arnold," (observe, reader,
   the qualified toryism of the man, for it is by little inadvertencies that
   great scoundrels are first discovered). "At the time, says he, Petersburgh
   was occupied by the British troops under the command of the* GENERALS PHILLIPS AND ARNOLD." 
   *A man who had the proper feelings of an American would have
   said,* "at the time Petersburgh was occupied by the *enemy* under the command
   of the British general Phillips and the *traitor* Arnold;" but this did not
   suit Turner's creed; "Mr. Jefferson, says he, who was then Governor of the
   state, did participate in the *partial* consternation (it was undoubtedly
   partial, for the tories were not in any consternation about it), *and did
   abandon the seat of government.*" This is the first charge.

   Now, if the circumstances of the times, of which Mr. Jefferson was himself
   the Judge, and not this runagate, rendered it proper for him, as Governor
   of the state, to remove from Richmond he did what was his duty to do, and
   in so doing he did right. In the year '76 Congress sat at Philadelphia,
   and according to Turner's phrase and inference Philadelphia was then the
   *seat of government*, and Congress ought not to have *abandoned* it. &mdash; But when
   the enemy penetrated the Jersies and approached towards the Delaware,
   Congress removed to Baltimore; the next year they removed to Lancaster,
   and from thence to York-Town, in Pennsylvania. It is nonsense to talk about
   a *seat of government* when a county is invaded. The seat of government
   then is wherever government sit. Perhaps in a village; perhaps in a farm house; 
   perhaps in a barn; perhaps, in the open air. &mdash;
   Pray how much does Pitt and Dundas give this ignoramus for making a
   public fool of himself?

   Turner's second charge is of the same character with his first; malignant
   and impotent. &mdash; "The sequel, says he, of Mr. Jefferson's conduct after the
   assembly returned to Charlotteville, and on the approach of Col. Tarlton
   to that place, (so then the Assembly also had *abandoned* Richmond) stands
   attested by thousands of witnesses and can never be forgotten by those of
   his country-men who respect the character of a firm and virtuous public
   officer, and who abhor that of a dastardly *traitor* to the trust reposed in
   him." On reading this terrible introductory passage of alarm one would
   expect that some most enormous crime was to be announced, nothing less
   than that governor Jefferson, like Gen. Arnold, had come over to the
   enemy. No such thing, but directly the contrary. "Mr. Jefferson's retreat
   (says Turner) or rather *flight* from *Monticello* (Mr. Jefferson's residence
   in Virginia) on the information that Tarlton had penetrated the country,
   and was advancing to Charlotteville; was effected with such hurried
   abruptness as to produce a fall from his horse and a dislocation of the
   shoulder." (Now if any one was a traitor in this affair it must have been
   the *horse* for having thrown his rider and dislocated his shoulder, that
   the forces who were after him might be able to come up with him.) In this
   situation (continues Turner, that is, with his shoulder dislocated) "Mr.
   Jefferson proceeded about 60 miles south to the county of Bedford whence
   he forwarded  his resignation to the Assembly, who had, in the mean time,
   removed to Staunton (so the Assembly has also retreated) and who
   thereupon, that is, on Mr. Jefferson's resignation, elected General Nelson
   Governor." Turner having told this most wonderful tale concludes it by
   assuring his brother skunk of Massachusetts, that "these circumstances are
   *substantially* and *literally* true."

   Now, would any one but a half-witted malignant torified Paltroon, one who
   has not sense enough to know how to do mischief, have told this story for
   the purpose of defaming Mr. Jefferson, when even from his own manner of
   telling it, it shews Mr. Jefferson's patriotism and integrity. The state
   of Virginia being then invaded, it was most proper that a military man
   should be at the head of its affairs, and Mr. Jefferson had never made the
   study and use of arms his profession; and besides this, the dislocation of
   his shoulder had rendered him unfit for any thing of active life. In this
   state of things he did what an honest patriot ought to do, that is, make
   room for another person by sending in his resignation &mdash; a mere skunk, such
   as Turner has proved himself to be, would have acted a different part. He
   would have gone over to the "*British troops*," or if he could not do this,
   would have shut himself up in his chamber, or kept his bed, done nothing,
   continued drawing his salary as Governor in the mean time, and perhaps
   charged the state with the surgeon's bill, on the plea that he received
   his injury in the public service of his country and ought to have a
   pension settled on him for life, and if they did not do this he would join
   Gen. Arnold and make Virginia smart for it. Thus much for Turner's second
   charge.

   His third charge relates to some pecuniary assistance Mr. Jefferson gave
   to Callender in his distress. The charge is introduced by the following
   preamble.

   "Mr. Jefferson's encouragement of *Callender and his rewarding that
   miscreant for the blackest effusions of the blackest calumny that ever
   escaped the envenomed pen of a villain*, are circumstances, as well known
   in Richmond, and as capable of positive proof, as is the circumstances of
   his having delivered an inaugural speech or any thing else of the most
   public notoriety." This paragraph is in the highest stile of envenomed
   blackguardism; and it is first necessary to know to what publication of
   Callender Turner applies this language, for it is by knowing this, that we
   come at the political character of Turner and of the gang to which he
   belongs.

   Callender began his career in this country by publishing a work on the
   atrocities of the English system of government, and the ruinous measures
   copied from thence and adopted in this country during the wretched
   administration of John Adams. The work has some merit both as to matter
   and composition; but it has no merit with a tory nor with any *conspirator
   concerned in the treasonable project of bringing over a foreign royal
   blackguard to be king of America.* It is to this work of Callender that
   Turner applies his abuse. We now know what Turner is.

   As to Callender, the case is, that under the character of a distressed
   patriot of some talents, though he turned out to be a scoundrel,
   afterwards, he made his case known to Mr. Jefferson who assisted him,
   according to Turner's account, with fifty dollars at one time, and fifty
   more afterwards. All this is to Mr. Jefferson's credit. But such
   miscreants as Turner, viewing every thing through the perverting fog of
   toryism, make good, evil; and evil, good; for the work that Callender was
   then publishing was against toryism. Turner, as if in proving the public
   spirited benevolence of Mr. Jefferson was proving something against him,
   assures us, fool-like, that *it is true*, and appeals to Mr. *Davis* of Richmond
   as evidence that Mr. Jefferson did actually assist Callender, that is,
   when he was publishing his work against toryism, with an hundred dollars.

   (This is most probably the same Davis, for *birds of a feather will flock
   together*, that circulated a forgery done by Donald Frazer, a Scotch
   school-master in William Street, N. York, and entitled "*The Recantation of
   Thomas Payne.*" The case is concisely as follows: &mdash; Mr. Paine was not in
   America when it was done, and Frazer hearing after Mr. Paine's return that
   he intended to prosecute him for the forgery, put on a face of brass and
   went to Mr. P. last winter at New-York to make his *confession* which he
   did in the following manner, several persons being present: &mdash; "Sir, said
   Frazer, I came over to this country in the war to fight the rebels; but I
   was put in prison; and when I got out, wanting something to do, I set up
   for a *fencing master*; but a Frenchman came and set up against me, and he
   soon shewed that I was no fencing master. Then, sir, I turned *Clergyman*
   and set out to preach, but there were others that out-preached me and I
   had to give up preaching. After several adventures I became a
   School-master; at last a lucky thought came in my head to turn author, and
   write your *Recantation*; and I got more money by it than I did by preaching
   and fencing, for I cleared between seventy and eighty dollars. &mdash; The work
   had not much sale in New-York for the people soon knew it was not yours.
   But I sent four hundred copies to my friend *Davis* in Virginia, and he sold
   them all as your genuine work.") If Turner's Davis is the same as Donald
   Frazer's Davis, there is a pretty gang of them.

   This much for Turner's third charge. &mdash; The baseness of this man consists in
   a villainous misrepresentation of every circumstance he relates. Mr.
   Jefferson's quitting Richmond, when the state was invaded (for the
   legislature also quitted it) and his quitting afterwards his own house
   (for the legislature at the same time quitted Charlotteville) are stated
   by this man as crimes; whereas they were necessary precautions to preserve
   the official papers and orders of the government from falling into the
   hands of the enemy; and Mr. Jefferson's resignation of the office of
   Governor after the dislocation of his shoulder, to make room for General
   Nelson, was disinterested patriotism. The assistance also given to
   Callender, at the time it was done, and for the purpose for which it was
   done, that of enabling him to get out his work against toryism, was a
   praise worthy act &mdash; Callender afterwards turned a scoundrel and then
   expiated his crime by drowning himself; and the world, Turner, will be rid
   of another scoundrel if thou wilt go and do so likewise.

   No. II

   In the former number I showed the villainous misrepresentations of this
   co-partner of Callender, Thomas Turner of Virginia, in the three first
   calumnious charges he brings in his letter, against Mr. Jefferson. Before
   I proceed further I will make some remarks respecting that letter.

   In the first place it does not appear that Turner supposed his letter 
   would be published or that he intended it should. He wrote
   it to set somebody else on; for he says in the conclusion of his letter,
   "If you (the person to whom it was written) find occasion you are at
   liberty to make use of my name in this *business* (that is in the business
   of blackguarding Mr. Jefferson) but if not necessary *I have no particular
   inclination to appear in it*." The inference from this is, you may use my
   name verbally, by word of mouth, but not publish my letter.

   The letter, as far as circumstances justify the conjecture, was written to
   that hypocritical imposter *Hulbert*, of Sheffield in Massachusetts, for
   Hulbert's speech in the legislature of that once respectable state is a
   detail of all the blackguardism in this letter. The person, however, to
   whom it was written is evidently the person who sent it for publication in
   the *Repertory*. He speaks of himself in the first person, the
   self-important pronoun *I*, but without letting the reader know who *I* is,
   and he introduces the letter with a preface of his own, beginning with the
   following sentence &mdash; "The various charges which have been advanced against
   Mr. Jefferson, and which, from a complete conviction of their truth *I*
   pledged myself to support, instead of silencing the *head-strong* advocates
   of the *distinguished profligate* (the writer of this deserves to have his
   head broke) have produced nothing but a torrent of personal abuse." He has
   good luck that it did not produce a personal horse-whipping.

   We find by this doleful confession that Hulbert's unprincipled speech and
   infamous abuse of Mr. Jefferson has recoiled upon himself, and that to
   lessen the severity of the stroke he turns traitor to his prompter,
   *Turner*, and publishes his letter, which he calls a communication from
   Thomas Turner, Esq. of Virginia, "*A gentleman of very respectable
   character and whose veracity will not be questioned.*" It would make even a
   surly Diogenes laugh to hear two scoundrels vouching for each other's
   veracity. I now return to an examination of Turner's letter.

   Turner's fourth calumny is a tale about Mrs. Walker, who, if now living,
   must be upwards of sixty years of age; a tale, of which the public knows
   no fact, and is possessed of no evidence. The tale, however, is badly
   told, and swelled with such improbabilities as to render it distortedly
   ridiculous like a mite in a microscope. We have heard of a ten years siege
   of Troy; but who ever heard of a ten years siege to seduce? &mdash; and what is
   equally as wonderful, that a woman should keep it a secret ten years. "*Ten
   years* (says Turner and then repeats it in capitals) TEN YEARS, was Mr.
   Jefferson repeatedly and assiduously making attempts which were as
   repeatedly and with *horror* repelled." There could not be much *horror* in
   the case or it would have killed any woman in less than a tenth part of
   that time.

   Neither will it be easy to find any ten years of Mr. Jefferson's life that
   could be thus devoted. It could not be within the last thirty years; for
   he drew up the Declaration of Independence in '76 and Congress was then at
   Philadelphia. He was Governor of Virginia when it was invaded, and Turner
   himself has shewn he had then no stationary residence and had quitted his
   own plantation. After the war he went as minister to France; returned
   about the year eighty eight and was secretary of state at Philadelphia. When John
   Adams was President Mr. Jefferson was Vice-President at Washington and
   since that time President. Where, then, is this ten years to be placed? If
   liars ought to have good memories, manufacturers of Romance ought at least
   to consul possibilities.

   But, says Turner, I have seen the original correspondence between Mr.
   Walker and Mr. Jefferson. Perhaps what he saw, *if he saw any*, was as
   original and as genuine as the forged recantation of Thomas Paine. But
   admitting it to be what he calls it, what does his *seeing* it amount to? He
   has not given a single verbatim extract from it, which he certainly would
   have done if he had seen it, and if the correspondence had contained what
   he insinuates. Instead of this, he makes Mr. Jefferson express a sentiment
   that is highly honourable, for he makes him to say (I suppose he means in a
   letter to Mr. Walker) that "*he shall never cease to revere and attest the
   purity of Mrs. Walter's character.*" This, though malignantly intended by
   Turner, redounds to Mr. Jefferson's honour; for there is not a case in the
   social circle of life in which a man appears more a man, or more a man of
   honour, than when he vindicates the reputation of a woman unjustly accused
   or censured on his account. But Turner seems to have no other idea of a
   woman than as an animal, and to be insensible and incapable of that chaste
   and sentimental respect a man may conceive for a woman on account of her
   virtues and excellencies. He must therefore be unfit to be trusted with
   the society of any woman of character. This story, hackneyed as it is, has
   the appearance of being fabricated from some trifling circumstance, or
   some mistake, or to have originated in some family dispute with which the
   public has no concern, and all that we discover by it, is the malignant,
   unjust and hateful spite of faction. The story will never lose Mr.
   Jefferson a friend, or a vote; but the malicious misrepresentations with
   which it is told may gain him many.

   As a general rule, we may take it for granted, and that with as few
   exceptions as any general rule will admit of, that *private character is
   the foundation of public character*, and that where public character is
   uniformly honourable and upright, and that for a great length of time, the
   private character will be found the same. The country has had experience
   of Mr. Jefferson for thirty years in the various situations of member of
   Congress, foreign minister, secretary of state, vice-president, and
   President, in all which the breath of detraction has not dared to approach
   him. With this public testimony of fact in his favour the villainous
   detraction of private individual libellers recoil on themselves.

   Turner comes next to another tale, a tale about a black, or rather, he
   says, *a mulatto Sally*, for he seems not to know which it is, nor any thing
   about it; but he says "*it is unquestionably true,*" and as he might say
   this of any story however false, it serves to shew that he would say
   something if he could.

   Turner's last calumny is about some money that Mr. Jefferson, when he
   commenced the practice of the law, borrowed *on bond* of a Mr. Gabriel
   Jones. Turner does not tell us the sum, but I have somewhere seen it
   stated to be fifty pounds, Virginia currency, about one hundred and
   sixty seven dollars (no great bond, for it looks more like usury than
   friendship). This debt, Turner says, Mr. Jefferson paid in paper money; "I
   think, says Turner, in the year 1779." Perhaps it was in '78, or '77, or
   '76. "Mr. Jones, says Turner, indignant at such treatment, and
   appreciating the transaction by its merits, enclosed the bond to Mr.
   Jefferson accompanied with the paper money tendered and such remarks as
   the nature of the case was calculated to suggest." (Turner does not tell
   us what those remarks were, which shew he knows nothing about them, or
   if he does know, that it does not suit his purpose to tell them.) "The
   consequence," says Turner, "was, *a full discharge of the debt in specie.*"

   This is stated as a charge against Mr. Jefferson; whereas it is one of the
   most honorable instances that can be produced, and I believe the only one,
   of the payment of a debt at that time, and the friends of Mr. Jefferson
   are highly gratified that the maliciousness of his enemies has made it
   known. This Thomas Turner must be some stupid upstart that knows nothing
   of the times he writes about. Continental paper money was then a legal
   tender, and were tender of it made for a debt due and the tender refused,
   the debt was cancelled and could not be recovered by law. Mr. Jefferson
   did not avail himself of the law, though thousands did, but paid the debt
   in specie, even after his bond was returned, and when no law could compel
   him to pay it in any kind of money &mdash; Thus much for the sixth and last
   calumny of Thomas Turner of Virginia, the stupid correspondent of Hulbert,
   the hypocritical legislator of Sheffield, in Massachusetts.

   I have now gone, calmly and deliberately through all the charges and
   calumnies raised against Mr. Jefferson; but I have not done it for the
   purpose of defending him. I have done it to expose the baseness of the
   federal faction, and to hold it up to public detestation. Mr. Jefferson's
   conduct needs no defense. He has heard, with undisturbed composure, the
   ravings of this unprincipled faction, and resting his character on its
   own merits the public voice of his country has rewarded him with honor.

   It is, perhaps, a bold sentiment but it is a true one, that *a just man,
   when attached, should not defend himself.* His conduct will do it for him,
   and Time will put his detractors under his feet.
