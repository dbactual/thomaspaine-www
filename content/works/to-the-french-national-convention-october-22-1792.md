   To the French National Convention  October 22, 1792

   CITIZEN PRESIDENT:

   In the name of the deputies of the department of Pas de Calais, I have the
   honor of presenting to the Convention the felicitations of the General
   Council of the Commune of Calais on the abolition of royalty.

   Amid the joy inspired by this event, one can not forbear some pain at the
   folly of our ancestors, who have placed us under the necessity of treating
   seriously (solennellement) the abolition of a phantom.

   THOMAS PAINE, Deputy.
