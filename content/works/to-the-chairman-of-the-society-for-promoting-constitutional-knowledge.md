   To the Chairman of the Society for Promoting Constitutional Knowledge

   LONDON, May, 1792.

   It is now upwards of eight years since I was a resident inhabitant of the
   town of Lewes. My situation among you as an officer of the revenue, for
   more than six years, enabled me to see into the numerous and various
   distresses which the weight of taxes even at that time of day occasioned;
   and feeling, as I then did, and as it is natural for me to do, for the
   hard condition of others, it is with pleasure I can declare, and every
   person then under my survey, and now living, can witness the exceeding
   candor, and even tenderness, with which that part of the duty that fell to
   my share was executed. The name of Thomas Paine is not to be found in the
   records of the Lewes justices, in any one act of contention with, or
   severity of any kind whatever towards, the persons whom he surveyed,
   either in the town or in the country; of this Mr. Fuller and Mr. who will
   probably attend the meeting, can, if they please, give full testimony. It
   is, however, not in their power to contradict it. Having thus indulged
   myself in recollecting a place where I formerly had, and even now have,
   many friends, rich and poor, and most probably some enemies, I proceed to
   the import of my letter. Since my departure from Lewes, fortune or
   providence has thrown me into a line of action which my first setting out
   in life could not possibly have suggested to me. Many of you will
   recollect, that while I resided among you, there was not a man more firm
   and open in supporting the principles of liberty than myself, and I still
   pursue, and ever will, the same path.

   THOMAS PAINE
