   AND PARTICULARLY TO THE LEADERS OF THE FEDERAL FACTION

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Although Paine devoted a large portion of his time and energy, after his
   return to the United States in 1802, to the growing deistic movement and
   to religious issues in general, he was by no means indifferent to
   political questions. Indeed, he felt that the struggle he was waging
   against the reactionary clergy was essential for the progress of
   Jeffersonian democracy in America. To advance the Jeffersonian movement by
   exposing the principles and practices of the Federalists, he published
   several letters in The National Intelligencer during 1802 and 1803. The
   paper, published in the nation's capital, was edited by an English refugee
   named Gales, who in England had suffered persecution for his adherence to
   Paine's democratic doctrines. Other letters appeared in the Philadelphia
   National Aurora and the Trenton True American.

   Between November, 1802 and April, 1803 s e v e n letters addressed to the
   People of the United States appeared in the Jeffersonian press. (Some
   editions of these letters also include the correspondence between Paine
   and Samuel Adams, but it was thought wiser to include it in the section of
   correspondence, pp. 1432-1438.) In June, 1805, however, Paine published
   his Eight letter to the Citizens of the United States, and described it as
   "the most important of any I have published." (See below p. 1468.) This
   letter has never before been reprinted, and is now for the first time,
   since its original publication, made available to the public.

   The letters were widely reprinted and lent courage to those in America who
   believed with Jefferson and Paine in broadening American democratic
   institutions. They were also important in exposing and demolishing the
   Federalist claim that only those of their political persuasion had fought
   for a stronger, central government and were responsible for the adoption
   of the Federal Constitution. A contemporary observed: "His [Paine's]
   Letters to the People of the United States written since his return from
   France, show that there is no abatement of the vigor of his mind at his
   advanced age. They were peculiarly seasonable, being calculated to prevent
   the mischief that might have arisen from a set of disappointed men,
   endeavoring to propagate disaffection to the best government in the
   world." See "A Christian," in the Philadelphia Aurora, March 26, 1803.

   LETTER I (The National Intelligencer of November 15, 1802)

   AFTER an absence of almost fifteen years, I am again returned to the
   country in whose dangers I bore my share, and to whose greatness I
   contributed my part.

   When I sailed for Europe, in the spring of 1787, it was my intention to
   return to America the next year, and enjoy in retirement the esteem of my
   friends, and the repose I was entitled to. I had stood out the storm of
   one revolution, and had no wish to embark in another. But other scenes and
   other circumstances than those of contemplated ease were allotted to me.

   The French Revolution was beginning to germinate when I arrived in France.
   The principles of it were good, they were copied from America, and the men
   who conducted it were honest. But the fury of faction soon extinguished
   the one and sent the other to the scaffold. Of those who began that
   Revolution, I am almost the only survivor, and that through a thousand
   dangers. Lowe this not to the prayers of priests, nor to the piety of
   hypocrites, but to the continued protection of Providence.

   But while I beheld with pleasure the dawn of liberty rising in Europe, I
   saw with regret the lustre of it fading in America. In less than two years
   from the time of my departure some distant symptoms painfully suggested
   the idea that the principles of the Revolution were expiring on the soil
   that produced them. I received at that time a letter from a female
   literary correspondent, and in my answer to her, I expressed my fears on
   that head.

   I now know from the information I obtain upon the spot, that the
   impressions that then distressed me, for I was proud of America, were but
   too well founded. She was turning her back on her own glory, and making
   hasty strides in the retrograde path of oblivion. But a spark from the
   altar of Seventy-six, unextinguished and unextinguishable through the long
   night of error, is again lighting up, in every part of the Union, the
   genuine name of rational liberty.

   As the French Revolution advanced it fixed the attention of the world, and
   drew from the pensioned pen of Edmund Burke a furious attack. This brought
   me once more on the public theater of-politics, and occasioned the
   pamphlet "Rights of Man." It had the greatest run of any work ever
   published in the English language. The number of copies circulated in
   England, Scotland and Ireland, besides translations into foreign
   languages, was between four and five hundred thousand.

   The principles of that work were the same as those in "Common Sense," and
   the effects would have been the same in England as that had produced in
   America, could the vote of the nation been quietly taken, or had equal
   opportunities of consulting or acting existed. The only difference between
   the two works was that the one was adapted to the local circumstances of
   England, and the other to those of America.

   As to myself, I acted in both cases alike; I relinquished to the people of
   England, as I had done to those of America, all profits from the work. My
   reward existed in the ambition to do good, and the independent happiness
   of my own mind.

   But a faction, acting in disguise, was rising in America; they had lost
   sight of first principles. They were beginning to contemplate government
   as a profitable monopoly, and the people as hereditary property. It is,
   therefore, no wonder that the "Rights of Man" was attacked by that
   faction, and its author continually abused. But let them go on; give them
   rope enough and they will put an end to their own insignificance. There is
   too much common sense and independence in America to be long the dupe of
   any faction, foreign or domestic.

   But, in the midst of the freedom we enjoy, the licentiousness of the
   papers called Federal (and I know not why they are called so, for they are
   in their principles anti-federal and despotic), is a dishonor to the
   character of the country, and an injury to its reputation and importance
   abroad. They represent the whole people of America as destitute of public
   principle and private manners.

   As to any injury they can do at home to those whom they abuse, or service
   they can render to those who employ them, it is to be set down to the
   account of noisy nothingness. It is on themselves the disgrace recoils,
   for the reflection easily presents itself to every thinking mind, that
   those who abuse liberty when they possess it would abuse power could they
   obtain it; and, therefore, they may as well take as a general motto, for
   all such papers, we and our patrons are not fit to be trusted with power.

   There is in America, more than in any other country, a large body of
   people who attend quietly to their farms, or follow their several
   occupations; who pay no regard to the clamors of anonymous scribblers, who
   think for themselves, and judge of government, not by the fury of
   newspaper writers, but by the prudent frugality of its measures, and the
   encouragement it gives to the improvement and prosperity of the country;
   and who, acting on their own judgment, never come forward in an election
   but on some important occasion.

   When this body moves, all the little barkings of scribbling and witless
   curs pass for nothing. To say to this independent description of men, "You
   must turn out such and such persons at the next election, for they have
   taken off a great many taxes, and lessened the expenses of government,
   they have dismissed my son, or my brother, or myself, from a lucrative
   office, in which there was nothing to do"-is to show the cloven foot of
   faction, and preach the language of ill-disguised mortification.

   In every part of the Union, this faction is in the agonies of death, and
   in proportion as its fate approaches, gnashes its teeth and struggles. My
   arrival has struck it as with an hydrophobia, it is like the sight of
   water to canine madness.

   As this letter is intended to announce my arrival to my friends, and to my
   enemies if I have any, for I ought to have none in America, and as
   introductory to others that will occasionally follow, I shall close it by
   detailing the line of conduct I shall pursue.

   I have no occasion to ask, and do not intend to accept, any place or
   office in the Government. There is none it could give me that would be any
   ways equal to the profits I could make as an author, for I have an
   established fame in the literary world, could I reconcile it to my
   principles to make money by my politics or religion. I must be in
   everything what I have ever been, a disinterested volunteer; my proper
   sphere of action is on the common floor of citizenship, and to honest men
   I give my hand and my heart freely.

   I have some manuscript works to publish, of which I shall give proper
   notice, and some mechanical affairs to bring forward, that will employ all
   my leisure time. I shall continue these letters as I see occasion, and as
   to the low party prints that choose to abuse me, they are welcome; I shall
   not descend to answer them. I have been too much used to such common stuff
   to take any notice of it.

   The Government of England honored me with a thousand martyrdoms, by
   burning me in effigy in every town in that country, and their hirelings in
   America may do the same.

   THOMAS PAINE. CITY OF WASHINGTON

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   LETTER II (The National Intelligencer of November 22, 1802)

   As the affairs of the country to which I am returned are of more
   importance to the world, and to me, than of that I have lately left (for
   it is through the New World the Old must be regenerated, if regenerated at
   all), I shall not take up the time of the reader with an account

   of scenes that have passed in France, many of which are painful to
   remember and horrid to relate, but come at once to the circumstances in
   which I find America on my arrival.

   Fourteen years, and something more, have produced a change, at least among
   a part of the people, and I ask myself what it is? I meet or hear of
   thousands of my former connections, who are men of the same principles and
   friendships as when I left them. But a nondescript race, and of equivocal
   generation, assuming the name of Federalist-a name that describes no
   character of principle good or bad, and may equally be applied to
   either-has since started up with the rapidity of a mushroom, and like a
   mushroom is withering on its rootless stalk.

   Are those men federalized to support the liberties of their country or to
   overturn them? To add to its fair fame or riot on its spoils? The name
   contains no defined idea. It is like John Adams's definition of a
   republic, in his letter to Mr. Wythe of Virginia. It is, says he, an
   empire of laws and not of men. But as laws may be bad as well as good, an
   empire of laws may be the best of all governments or the worst of all
   tyrannies.

   But John Adams is a man of paradoxical heresies, and consequently of a
   bewildered mind. He wrote a book entitled, "A Defense of the American
   Constitutions," and the principles of it are an attack upon them. But the
   book is descended to the tomb of forgetfulness, and the best fortune that
   can attend its author is quietly to follow its fate. John was not born for
   immortality. But, to return to Federalism.

   In the history of parties and the names they assume, it often happens that
   they finish by the direct contrary principles with which they profess to
   begin, and thus it has happened with Federalism.

   During the time of the old Congress, and prior to the establishment of the
   Federal Government, the Continental belt was too loosely buckled. The
   several States were united in name but not in fact, and that nominal union
   had neither center nor circle. The laws of one State frequently interfered
   with, and sometimes opposed, those of another. Commerce between State and
   State was without protection, and confidence without a point to rest on.
   The condition the country was then in was aptly described by Pelatiah
   Webster, when he said, "thirteen staves and ne'er a hoop will not make a
   barrel!'

   If, then, by Federalist is to be understood one who was for cementing the
   Union by a general government operating equally over all the States, in
   all matters that embraced the common interest, and to which the authority
   of the States severally was not adequate, for no one State can make laws
   to bind another; if, I say, by a Federalist is meant a person of this
   description (and this is the origin of the name), I ought to stand first
   on the list of Federalists, for the proposition for establishing a general
   government over the Union, came originally from me in 1783, in a written
   memorial to Chancellor Livingston, then Secretary for Foreign Affairs to
   Congress, Robert Morris, Minister of Finance, and his associate,
   Gouverneur Morris, all of whom are now living; and we had a dinner and
   conference at Robert Morris's on the subject. The occasion was as follows:

   Congress had proposed a duty of five per cent on imported articles, the
   money to be applied as a fund toward paying the interest of loans to be
   borrowed in Holland. The resolve was sent to the several States to be
   enacted into a law. Rhode Island absolutely refused. I was at the trouble
   of a journey to Rhode Island to reason with them on the subject. Some
   other of the States enacted it with alterations, each one as it pleased.
   Virginia adopted it, and afterwards repealed it, and the affair came to
   nothing.

   It was then visible, at least to me, that either Congress must frame the
   laws necessary for the Union, and send them to the several States to be
   enregistered without any alteration, which would in itself appear like
   usurpation on one part and passive obedience on the other, or some method
   must be devised to accomplish the same end by constitutional principles;
   and the proposition I made in the memorial was, to add a Continental
   legislature to Congress, to be elected by the several States.

   The proposition met the full approbation of the gentlemen to whom it was
   addressed, and the conversation turned on the manner of bringing it
   forward. Gouverneur Morris, in talking with me after dinner, wished me to
   throw out the idea in the newspaper; I replied, that I did not like to be
   always the proposer of new things, that it would have too assuming an
   appearance; and besides, that / did not thin the country was quite wrong
   enough to be put right.

   I remember giving the same reason to Dr. [Benjamin] Rush, at Philadelphia,
   and to General [Horatio] Gates, at whose quarters I spent a day on my
   return from Rhode Island; and I suppose they will remember it because the
   observation seemed to strike them.

   But the embarrassments increasing, as they necessarily must from the want
   of a better cemented union, the State of Virginia proposed holding a
   commercial convention, and that convention, which was not sufficiently
   numerous, proposed that another convention, with more extensive and better
   defined powers, should be held at Philadelphia, May 10, 1787.

   When the plan of the Federal Government, formed by this convention, was
   proposed and submitted to the consideration of the several States, it was
   strongly objected to in each of them. But the objections were not on
   anti-Federal grounds, but on constitutional points. Many were shocked at
   the idea of placing what is called executive power in the hands of a
   single individual. To them it had too much the form and appearance of a
   military government, or a despotic one.

   Others objected that the powers given to a President were too great, and
   that in the hands of an ambitious and designing man it might grow into
   tyranny as it did in England under Oliver Cromwell, and as it has since
   done in France. A republic must not only be so in its principles, but in
   its forms.

   The executive part of the Federal Government was made for a man, and those
   who consented, against their judgment, to place executive power in the
   hands of a single individual, reposed more on the supposed moderation of
   the person they had in view, than on the wisdom of the measure itself.

   Two considerations, however, overcame all objections. The one was the
   absolute necessity of a Federal Government. The other, the rational
   reflections, that as government in America is founded on the
   representative system any error in the first essay could be reformed by
   the same quiet and rational process by which the Constitution was formed,
   and that either by the generation then living, or by those who were to
   succeed.

   If ever America lose sight of this principle, she will no longer be the
   land of liberty. The father will become the assassin of the rights of the
   son, and his descendants be a race of slaves.

   As many thousands who were minors are grown up to manhood since the name
   of Federalist began, it became necessary, for their information, to go
   back and show the origin of the name, which is now no longer what it
   originally was; but it was the more necessary to do this, in order to
   bring forward, in the open face of day, the apostasy of those who first
   called themselves Federalists.

   To them it served as a cloak for treason, a mask for tyranny. Scarcely
   were they placed in the seat of power and office, than federalism was to
   be destroyed, and the representative system of government, the pride and
   glory of America, and the palladium of her liberties, was to be over-
   thrown and abolished. The next generation was not to be free. The son was
   to bend his neck beneath the father's foot, and live, deprived of his
   rights, under hereditary control.

   Among the men of this apostate description, is to be ranked the
   ex-President John Adams. It has been the political career of this man to
   begin with hypocrisy, proceed with arrogance, and finish in contempt. May
   such be the fate of all such characters.

   I have had doubts of John Adams ever since the year 1776. In a
   conversation with me at that time, concerning the pamphlet "Common Sense,"
   he censured it because it attacked the English form of government. John
   was for independence because he expected to be made great by it; but it
   was not difficult to perceive, for the surliness of his temper makes him
   an awkward hypocrite, that his head was as full of kings, queens and
   knaves, as a pack of cards. But John has lost deal.

   When a man has a concealed project in his brain that he wants to bring
   forward, and fears will not succeed, he begins with it as physicians do by
   suspected poison, try it first on an animal; if it agree with the stomach
   of the animal he makes further experiments, and this was the way John
   took. His brain was teeming with projects to overturn the liberties of
   America and the representative system of government, and he began by
   hinting it in little companies.

   The secretary of John Jay, an excellent painter and a poor politician,
   told me, in presence of another American, Daniel Parker, that in a company
   where himself was present, John Adams talked of making the government
   hereditary, and that as Mr. Washington had no children, it should be made
   hereditary in the family of Lund Washington.

   John had not impudence enough to propose himself in the first instance, as
   the old French Normandy baron did, who offered to come over to be king of
   America, and if Congress did not accept his offer, that they would give
   him thirty thousand pounds for the generosity of it; but John, like a
   mole, was grubbing his way to it under ground. He knew that Lund
   Washington was unknown, for nobody had heard of him, and that as the
   President had no children to succeed him, the Vice-President had, and if
   the treason had succeeded, and the hint with it, the goldsmith might be
   sent for to take measure of the head of John or of his son for a golden
   wig.

   In this case, the good people of Boston might have for a king the man they
   have rejected as a delegate. The representative system is fatal to
   ambition.

   Knowing, as I do, the consummate vanity of John Adams, and the shallowness
   of his judgment, I can easily picture to myself that when he arrived at
   the Federal City [Washington] he was strutting in the pomp of his
   imagination before the presidential house, or in the audience hall, and
   exulting in the language of Nebuchadnezzar, "Is not this great Babylon,
   that I have built for the honor of my Majesty!" But in that unfortunate
   hour, or soon after, John, like Nebuchadnezzar, was driven from among men,
   and fled with the speed of a post-horse.

   Some of John Adams's loyal subjects, I see, have been to present him with
   an address on his birthday; but the language they use is too tame for the
   occasion. Birthday addresses, like birthday odes, should not creep along
   like mildrops down a cabbage leaf, but roll in a torrent of poetical
   metaphor. I will give them a specimen for the next year. Here it is:

   When an ant, in traveling over the globe, lifts up its foot, and puts it
   again on the ground, it shakes the earth to its center: but when YOU, the
   mighty Ant of the East, was born, etc., etc., etc., the center jumped upon
   the surface.

   This, gentlemen, is the proper style of addresses from well-bred ants to
   the monarch of the ant hills; and as I never take pay for preaching,
   praying, politics or poetry, I make you a present of it. Some people talk
   of impeaching John Adams; but I am for softer measures. I would keep him
   to make fun of. He will then answer one of the end for which he was born,
   and he ought to be thankful that I am arrived to take his part.

   I voted in earnest to save the life of one unfortunate king, and I now
   vote in jest to save another. It is my fate to be always plagued with
   fools. But to return to Federalism and apostasy.

   The plan of the leaders of the faction was to overthrow the liberties of
   the New World, and place government on the corrupt system of the Old. They
   wanted to hold their power by a more lasting tenure than the choice of
   their constituents. It is impossible to account for their conduct and the
   measures they adopted on any other ground.

   But to accomplish that object, a standing army and a prodigal revenue must
   be raised; and to obtain these pretenses must be invented to deceive.
   Alarms of dangers that did not exist even in imagination, but in the
   direct spirit of lying, were spread abroad. Apostasy stalked through the
   land in the garb of patriotism, and the torch of treason blinded for a
   while the flame of liberty.

   For what purpose could an army of twenty-five thousand men be wanted? A
   single reflection might have taught the most credulous that while the war
   raged between France and England, neither could spare a man to invade
   America. For what purpose, then, could it be wanted? The case carries its
   own explanation. It was wanted for the purpose of destroying the
   representative system, for it could be employed for no other. Are these
   men Federalists? If they are, they are federalized to deceive and to
   destroy.

   The rage against Dr. Logan's patriotic and voluntary mission to France
   (see Foner's footnote at bottom of this letter) was excited by the shame
   they felt at the detection of the false alarms they had circulated. As to
   the opposition given by the remnant of the faction to the repeal of the
   taxes laid on during the former Administration, it is easily accounted
   for. The repeal of those taxes was a sentence of condemnation on those who
   laid them on, and in the opposition they gave in that repeal they are to
   be considered in the light of criminals standing on their defense and the
   country has passed judgment upon them.

   THOMAS PAINE.CITY OF WASHINGTON,

   Lovett's Hotel,

   November 19, 1802.

   Footnote by Foner: George Logan, friend of Jefferson and of the French
   Revolution, sought in 1798 to bring about a better understanding between
   the United States and France in order to avert the war that threatened as
   a result of the "X,Y,Z" affair. The Federalists bitterly opposed the
   project, but Logan persisted in his determination to cement friendly
   relations between his country and France. Selling some land to pay his
   expenses and, equipped with a letter of introduction from Jefferson, he
   sailed for Hamburg. There, through the influence of Lafayette, who was
   living in exile in the region, he obtained papers from the French legation
   which permitted him to enter France. In August, 1798 he met Talleyrand,
   and convinced him that the recent French policy towards the United States
   had had a disastrous effect upon American public opinion. Eventually Logan
   was able to secure the release of imprisoned American seamen, the raising
   of an embargo on American ships, and received assurance from French
   officials that a minister from the United States would be warmly received.
   The Federalists, however, still continued to denounce Logan for
   frustrating their schemes to involve America in a war with France, and
   Congress, on January 30, 1799, passed the so-called "Logan Act,"
   forbidding a private citizen from undertaking diplomatic negotiations
   without official sanction.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   LETTER III (The National Intelligencer of November 29, 1802)

   To ELECT, and to REJECT, is the prerogative of a free people.

   Since the establishment of independence, no period has arrived that so
   decidedly proves the excellence of the representative system of
   government, and its superiority over every other, as the time we now live
   in. Had America been cursed with John Adams's hereditary Monarchy, or
   Alexander Hamilton's Senate for life, she must have sought, in the
   doubtful contest of civil war, what she now obtains by the expression of
   public will. An appeal to elections decides better than an appeal to the
   sword.

   The Reign of Terror that raged in America during the latter end of the
   Washington Administration, and the whole of that of Adams, is enveloped in
   mystery to me. That there were men in the Government hostile to the
   representative system, was once their boast, though it is now their
   overthrow, and therefore the fact is established against them.

   But that so large a mass of the people should become the dupes of those
   who were loading them with taxes in order to load them with chains, and
   deprive them of the aright of election, can be ascribed only to that
   species of wildfire rage, lighted up by falsehood that not only acts
   without reflection, but is too impetuous to make any.

   There is a general and striking difference between the genuine effects of
   truth itself, and the effects of falsehood believed to be truth. Truth is
   naturally benign; but falsehood believed to be truth is always furious.
   The former delights in serenity, is mild and persuasive, and seeks not the
   auxiliary aid of invention. The latter sticks at nothing.

   It has naturally no morals. Every lie is welcome that suits its purpose.
   It is the innate character of the thing to act in this manner, and the
   criterion by which it may be known, whether in politics or religion. When
   anything is attempted to be supported by lying it is presumptive evidence
   that the thing so supported is a lie also. The stock on which a lie can be
   grafted must be of the same species as the graft.

   What is become of the mighty clamor of French invasion, and the cry that
   our country is in danger, and taxes and armies must be raised to defend it
   ? The danger is fled with the faction that created it, and what is worst
   of all, the money is fled too. It is I only that have committed the
   hostility of invasion, and all the artillery of pop-guns are prepared for
   action.

   Poor fellows, how they foam! They set half their own partisans in
   laughter; for among ridiculous things nothing is more ridiculous than
   ridiculous rage. But I hope they will not leave off. I shall lose half my
   greatness when they cease to lie.

   So far as respects myself, I have reason to believe and a right to say
   that the leaders of the Reign of Terror in America and the leaders of the
   Reign of Terror in France, during the time of Robespierre, were in
   character the same sort of men; or how is it to be accounted for, that I
   was persecuted by both at the same time? When I was voted out of the
   French Convention, the reason assigned for it was, that I was a foreigner.

   When Robespierre had me seized in the night, and imprisoned in the
   Luxembourg (where I remained eleven months), he assigned no reason for it.
   But when he proposed bringing me to the tribunal, which was like sending
   me at once to the scaffold, he then assigned a reason, and the reason was,
   for the interests of America as well as of France. "Pour les interets de
   I'Amerique autant que de la France,"

   The words are in his own hand-writing, and reported to the Convention by
   the committee appointed to examine his papers, and are printed in their
   report, with this reflection added to them, "Why Thomas Paine more than
   another? Because he contributed to the liberty of both worlds."

   There must have been a coalition in sentiment, if not in fact, between the
   Terrorists of America and the Terrorists of France, and Robespierre must
   have known it, or he could not have had the idea of putting America into
   the bill of accusation against me.

   Yet these men, these Terrorists of the New World, who were waiting in the
   devotion of their hearts for the joyful news of my destruction, are the
   same banditti who are now bellowing in all the hackneyed language of
   hackneyed hypocrisy about humanity and piety, and often about something
   they call infidelity, and they finish with the chorus of Crucify him,
   crucify him. I am become so famous among them, they cannot eat or drink
   without me. I serve them as a standing dish, and they cannot make up a
   bill of fare if I am not in it.

   But there is one dish, and that the choicest of all, that they have not
   presented on the table, and it is time they should. They have not yet
   accused Providence of Infidelity. Yet according to their outrageous piety,
   she must be as bad as Thomas Paine; she has protected him in all his
   dangers, patronized him in all his undertaking, encouraged him in all his
   ways, and rewarded him at last by bringing him in safety and in health to
   the Promised Land.

   This is more than she did by the Jews, the chosen people, that they tell
   us she brought out of the land of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage;
   for they all died in the wilderness, and Moses too.

   I was one of the nine members that composed the first Committee of
   Constitution. Six of them have been destroyed. Sieyes and myself have
   survived-he by bending with the times, and I by not bending. The other
   survivor joined Robespierre; he was seized and imprisoned in his turn, and
   sentenced to transportation. He has since apologized to me for having
   signed the warrant, by saying he felt himself in danger and was obliged to
   do it.

   Herault, Sechelles, an acquaintance of Mr. Jefferson, and a good patriot,
   was my suppliant as member of the Committee of Constitution, that is, he
   was to supply my place, if I had not accepted or had resigned, being next
   in number of votes to me. He was imprisoned in the Luxembourg with me, was
   taken to the tribunal and the guillotine, and I, his principal, was left.

   There were two foreigners in the Convention, Anarcharsis Clootz and
   myself. We were both put out of the Convention by the same vote, arrested
   by the same order, and carried to prison together the same night. He was
   taken to the guillotine, and I was again left. Joel Barlow was with us
   when we went to prison.

   Joseph Lebon, one of the vilest characters that ever existed, and who made
   the streets of Arras run with blood, was my suppleant, as member of the
   Convention for the department of the Pas de Calais. When I was put out of
   the Convention he came and took my place. When I was

   liberated from prison and voted again into the Convention, he was sent to
   the same prison and took my place there, and he was sent to the guillotine
   instead of me. He supplied my place all the way through.

   One hundred and sixty-eight persons were taken out of the Luxembourg in
   one night, and a hundred and sixty of them guillotined next day, of which
   I now know I was to have been one; and the manner I escaped that fate is
   curious, and has all the appearance of accident.

   The room in which I was lodged was on the ground floor, and one of a long
   range of rooms under a gallery, and the door of it opened outward and flat
   against the wall; so that when it was open the inside of the door appeared
   outward, and the contrary when it was shut. I had three comrades, fellow
   prisoners with me, Joseph Vanhuele, of Bruges, since president of the
   municipality of that town, Michael Rubyns, and Charles Bastini of Louvain.

   When persons by scores and by hundreds were to be taken out of the prison
   for the guillotine it was always done in the night, and those who
   performed that office had a private mark or signal, by which they knew
   what rooms to go to, and what number to take. We, as I have stated, were
   four, and the door of our room was marked, unobserved by us, with that
   number in chalk; but it happened, if happening is a proper word, that the
   mark was put on when the door was open, and flat against the wall, and
   thereby came on the inside when we shut it at night, and the destroying
   angel passed by it. A few days after this, Robespierre fell, and Mr.
   Monroe arrived and reclaimed me, and invited me to his house.

   During the whole of my imprisonment, prior to the fall of Robespierre,
   there was no time when I could think my life worth twenty-four hours, and
   my mind was made up to meet its fate. The Americans in Paris went in a
   body to the Convention to reclaim me, but without success. There was no
   party among them with respect to me.

   My only hope then rested on the Government of America, that it would
   remember me. But the icy heart of ingratitude, in whatever man it be
   placed, has neither feeling nor sense of honor. The letter of Mr.
   Jefferson has served to wipe away the reproach, and done justice to the
   mass of the people of America.

   When a party was forming, in the latter end of 1777, and beginning of
   1778, of which John Adams was one, to remove Mr. Washington from the
   command of the army on the complaint that he did nothing, I wrote the
   fifth number of the "Crisis," and published it at Lancaster (Congress then
   being at York Town, in Pennsylvania), to ward off that meditated blow; for
   though I well knew that the black times of '76 were the natural
   consequence of his want of military judgment in the choice of positions
   into which the army was put about New York and New Jersey, I could see no
   possible advantage, and nothing but mischief, that could arise by
   distracting the army into parties, which would have been the case had the
   intended motion gone on.

   General [Charles] Lee, who with a sarcastic genius joined [to] a great
   fund of military knowledge, was perfectly right when he said "We have no
   business on islands, and in the bottom of bogs, where the enemy, by the
   aid of its ships, can bring its whole force against a part of ours and
   shut it up!' This had like to have been the case at New York, and it was
   the case at Fort Washington, and would have been the case at Fort Lee if
   General [Nathanael] Greene had not moved instantly off on the first news
   of the enemy's approach. I was with Greene through the whole of that
   affair and know it perfectly.

   But though I came forward in defense of Mr. Washington when he was
   attacked, and made the best that could be made of a series of blunders
   that had nearly ruined the country, he left me to perish when I was in
   prison. But as I told him of it in his life-time, I should not now bring
   it up if the ignorant impertinence of some of the Federal papers, who are
   pushing Mr. Washington forward as their stalking horse, did not make it
   necessary.

   That gentleman did not perform his part in the Revolution better, nor with
   more honor, than I did mine, and the one part was as necessary as the
   other. He accepted as a present (though he was already rich), a hundred
   thousand acres of land in America, and left me to occupy six foot of earth
   in France.

   I wish, for his own reputation, he had acted with more justice. But it was
   always known of Mr. Washington, by those who best knew him, that he was of
   such an icy and death-like constitution that he neither loved his friends
   nor hated his enemies. But, be this as it may, I see no reason that a
   difference between Mr. Washington and me should be made a theme of discord
   with other people. There are those who may see merit in both without
   making themselves partisans of either, and with this reflection I close
   the subject.

   As to the hypocritical abuse thrown out by the Federalists on other
   subjects, I recommend to them the observance of a commandment that existed
   before either Christian or Jew existed:

   Thou shalt make a covenant with thy senses:

   With thine eye, that it behold no evil,

   With thine ear, that it hear no evil,

   With thy tongue, that it speak no evil,

   With thy hands, that they commit no evil.

   If the Federalists will follow this commandment, they will leave off
   lying.

   FEDERAL CITY,

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   LETTER IV (The National Intelligencer of December 6, 1802)

   As Congress is on the point of meeting, the public papers will necessarily
   be occupied with the debates of the ensuing session, and as, in
   consequence of my long absence from America, my private affairs require my
   attendance (for it is necessary I do this, or I could not preserve, as I
   do, my independence), I shall close my address to the public with this
   letter.

   I congratulate them on the success of the late elections, and that with
   the additional confidence, that while honest men are chosen and wise
   measures pursued, neither the treason of apostasy, masked under the name
   of Federalism, of which I have spoken in my second letter, nor the
   intrigues of foreign emissaries, acting in concert with that mask, can
   prevail.

   As to the licentiousness of the papers calling themselves Federal, a name
   that apostasy has taken, it can hurt nobody but the party or the persons
   who support such papers. There is naturally a wholesome pride in the
   public mind that revolts at open vulgarity. It feels itself dishonored
   even by hearing it, as a chaste woman feels dishonor by hearing obscenity
   she cannot avoid. It can smile at wit, or be diverted with strokes of
   satirical humor, but it detests the blackguard.

   The same sense of propriety that governs in private companies, governs in
   public life. If a man in company runs his wit upon another, it may draw a
   smile from some persons present, but as soon as he turns a blackguard in
   his language the company gives him up; and it is the same in public life.

   The event of the late election shows this to be true; for in proportion as
   those papers have become more and more vulgar and abusive, the elections
   have gone more and more against the party they support, or that supports
   them. Their predecessor, Porcupine had wit-these scribblers have none. But
   as soon as his blackguardism (for it is the proper name of it) outran his
   wit, he was abandoned by everybody but the English minister who protected
   him.

   The Spanish proverb says, "there never was a cover large enough to hide
   itself'; and the proverb applies to the case of those papers and the
   shattered remnant of the faction that supports them. The falsehoods they
   fabricate, and the abuse they circulate, is a cover to hide something from
   being seen, but it is not large enough to hide itself. It is as a tub
   thrown out to the whale to prevent its attacking and sinking the vessel.
   They want to draw the attention of the public from thinking about, or
   inquiring into, the measures of the late Administration, and the reason
   why so much public money was raised and expended; and so far as a lie
   to-day, and a new one tomorrow, will answer this purpose, it answers
   theirs. It is nothing to them whether they be believed or not, for if the
   negative purpose be answered the main point is answered, to them.

   He that picks your pocket always tries to make you look another way.
   "Look," says he, "at yon man t'other side the street-what a nose he has
   got?-Lord, yonder is a chimney on fire!-Do you see yon man going along in
   the salamander great coat? That is the very man that stole one of
   Jupiter's satellites, and sold it to a countryman for a gold watch, and it
   set his breeches on fire!"

   Now the man that has his hand in your pocket, does not care a farthing
   whether you believe what he says or not. All his aim is to prevent your
   looking at him; and this is the case with the remnant of the Federal
   faction. The leaders of it have imposed upon the country, and they want to
   turn the attention of it from the subject.

   In taking up any public matter, I have never made it a consideration, and
   never will, whether it be popular or unpopular; but whether it be right or
   wrong. The right will always become the popular, if it has courage to show
   itself, and the shortest way is always a straight line.

   I despise expedients, they are the gutter-hole of politics, and the sink
   where reputation dies. In the present case, as in every other, I cannot be
   accused of using any; and I have no doubt but thousands will hereafter be
   ready to say, as Gouverneur Morris said to me, after having abused me
   pretty-handsomely in Congress for the opposition I gave the fraudulent
   demand of Silas Deane of two thousand pounds sterling: "Well, we were all
   duped, and I among the rest!"

   Were the late Administration to be called upon to give reasons for the
   expense it put the country to, it can give none. The danger of an invasion
   was a bubble that served as a cover to raise taxes and armies to be
   employed on some other purpose. But if the people of America believed it
   true, the cheerfulness with which they supported these measures and paid
   those taxes is an evidence of their patriotism; and if they supposed me
   their enemy, though in that supposition they did me injustice, it was not
   injustice in them. He that acts as he believes, though he may act wrong,
   is not conscious of wrong.

   But though there was no danger, no thanks are due to the late
   Administration for it. They sought to blow up a flame between the two
   countries; and so intent were they upon this, that they went out of their
   way to accomplish it. In a letter which the Secretary of State, Timothy
   Pickering, wrote to Mr. Skip with, the American Consul at Paris, he broke
   off from the official subject of his letter, to than God in very exulting
   language, that the Russians had cut the French Army to pieces. Mr.
   Skipwith, after showing me the letter, very prudently concealed it.

   It was the injudicious and wicked acrimony of this letter, and some other
   like conduct of the then Secretary of State, that occasioned me, in a
   letter to a friend in the Government, to say, that if there was any
   official business to be done in France, till a regular Minister could be
   appointed, it could not be trusted to a more proper person than Mr.
   Skipwith. "He is,' said I, "an honest man, and will do business, and that
   with good manners to the government he is commissioned to act with. A
   faculty which that BEAR, Timothy Pickering, wanted, and which the BEAR of
   that BEAR, John Adams, never possessed"

   In another letter to the same friend, in 1797, and which was put unsealed
   under cover to Colonel [Aaron] Burr, I expressed a satisfaction that Mr.
   Jefferson, since he was not President, had accepted the Vice-presidency;
   "for," said I, "John Adams has such a talent for blundering and offending,
   it will be necessary to keep an eye over him!' He has now sufficiently
   proved, that though I have not the spirit of prophecy, I have the gift of
   judging right.

   And all the world knows, for it cannot help knowing, that to judge rightly
   and to write clearly, and that upon all sorts of subjects, to be able to
   command thought and as it were to play with it at pleasure, and be always
   master of one's temper in writing, is the faculty only of a serene mind,
   and the attribute of a happy and philosophical temperament.

   The scribblers, who know me not, and who fill their papers with paragraphs
   about me, besides their want of talents, drink too many slings and drams
   in a morning to have any chance with me. But, poor fellows, they must do
   something for the little pittance they get from their employers. This is
   my apology for them.

   My anxiety to get back to America was great for many years. It is the
   country of my heart, and the place of my political and literary birth. It
   was the American Revolution that made me an author, and forced into action
   the mind that had been dormant, and had no wish for public life, nor has
   it now.

   By the accounts I received, she appeared to me to be going wrong, and that
   some meditated treason against her liberties lurked at the bottom of her
   government. I heard that my friends were oppressed, and I longed to take
   my stand among them, and if other times to try men's souls were to arrive,
   that I might bear my share. But my efforts to return were ineffectual.

   As soon as Mr. Monroe had made a good standing with the French Government,
   for the conduct of his predecessor [Morris] had made his reception as
   Minister difficult, he wanted to send dispatches to his own Government by
   a person to whom he could confide a verbal communication, and he fixed his
   choice on me. He then applied to the Committee of Public Safety for a
   passport; but as I had been voted again into the Convention, it was only
   the Convention that could give the passport; arid as an application to
   them for that purpose would have made my going publicly known, I was
   obliged to sustain the disappointment, and Mr. Monroe to lose the
   opportunity.

   When that gentleman left France to return to America I was to have gone
   with him. It was fortunate I did not. The vessel he sailed in was visited
   by a British frigate, that searched every part of it, and down to the
   hold, for Thomas Paine. I then went, the same year, to embark at Havre.
   But several British frigates were cruising in sight of the port who knew I
   was there, and I had to return again to Paris.

   Seeing myself thus cut off from every opportunity that was in my power to
   command, I wrote to Mr. Jefferson, that, if the fate of the election
   should put him in the chair of the Presidency, and he should have occasion
   to send a frigate to France, he would give me the opportunity of returning
   by it, which he did. But I declined coming by the Maryland, the vessel
   that was offered me, and waited for the frigate that was to bring the new
   Minister, Mr. Chancellor Livingstone, to France.

   But that frigate was ordered round to the Mediterranean; and as at that
   time the war was over, and the British cruisers called in, I could come
   any way. I then agreed to come with Commodore Barney in a vessel he had
   engaged. It was again fortunate I did not, for the vessel sank at sea, and
   the people were preserved in the boat.

   Had half the number of evils befallen me that the number of dangers amount
   to through which I have been preserved, there are those who would ascribe
   it to the wrath of heaven; why then do they not ascribe my preservation to
   the protecting favor of heaven?

   Even in my worldly concerns, I have been blessed. The little property I
   left in America, and which I cared nothing about, not even to receive the
   rent of it, has been increasing in the Value of its capital more than
   eight hundred dollars every year, for the fourteen years and more that I
   have been absent from it. I am now in my circumstances independent; and my
   economy makes me rich. As to my health, it is perfectly good, and I leave
   the world to judge of the stature of my mind. I am in every instance a
   living contradiction to the mortified Federalists.

   In my publications, I follow the rule I began with in "Common Sense," that
   is, to consult nobody, nor to let anybody see what I write till it appears
   publicly. Were I to do otherwise the case would be that between the
   timidity of some, who are so afraid of doing wrong that they never do
   right, the puny judgment of others, and the despicable craft of preferring
   expedient to right, as if the world was a world of babies in leading
   strings, I should get forward with nothing.

   My path is a right line, as straight and clear to me as a ray of light.
   The boldness (if they will have it to be so) with which I speak on any
   subject is a compliment to the judgment of the reader. It is like saying
   to him, I treat you as a man and not as a child. With respect to any
   worldly object, as it is impossible to discover any in me, therefore what
   I do, and my manner of doing it, ought to be ascribed to a good motive.

   In a great affair, where the happiness of man is at stake, I love to work
   for nothing; and so fully am I under the influence of this principle, that
   I should lose the spirit, the pleasure, and the pride of it, were I
   conscious that I looked for reward; and with this declaration, I take my
   leave for the present.

   FEDERAL CITY

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   LETTER V (The National Intelligencer of February 2, 1803)

   It is always the interest of a far greater part of the nation to have a
   thing right than to have it wrong; and therefore, in a country whose
   government is founded on the system of election and representation, the
   fate of every party is decided by its principles.

   As this system is the only form and principle of government by which
   liberty can be preserved, and the only one that can embrace all the
   varieties of a great extent of country, it necessarily follows that to
   have the representation real, the election must be real; and that where
   the election is a fiction, the representation is a fiction also. Like will
   always produce like.

   A great deal has been said and written concerning the conduct of Mr. Burr,
   during the late contest, in the Federal Legislature, whether Mr. Jefferson
   or Mr. Burr should be declared President of the United States. (See
   Foner's footnote at the end of this letter.) Mr. Burr has been accused of
   intriguing to obtain the Presidency. Whether this charge be substantiated
   or not makes little or no part of the purport of this letter.

   There is a point of much higher importance to attend to than anything that
   relates to the individual Mr. Burr: for the great point is not whether Mr.
   Burr has intrigued, but whether the Legislature has intrigued with him.

   Mr. Ogden, a relation of one of the Senators of New Jersey of the same
   name, and of the party assuming the style of Federalists, has written a
   letter published in the New York papers, signed with his name, the purport
   of which is to exculpate Mr. Burr from the charges brought against him. In
   this letter he says:

   "When about to return from Washington, two or three Members of Congress of
   the Federal party spoke to me of their views as to the election of a
   President, desiring me to converse with Colonel Burr on the subject, and
   to ascertain whether he would enter into terms. On my re- turn to New York
   I called on Colonel Burr, and communicated the above to him. He explicitly
   declined the explanation, and did neither propose nor agree to any terms."

   How nearly is human cunning allied to folly! The animals to whom nature
   has given the faculty we call cunning, know always when to use it, and use
   it wisely; but when man descends to cunning, he blunders and betrays.

   Mr. Ogden's letter is intended to exculpate Mr. Burr from the charge of
   intriguing to obtain the Presidency; and the letter that he (Ogden) writes
   for this purpose is direct evidence against his party in Congress that
   they intrigued with Burr to obtain him for President, and employed him
   (Ogden) for the purpose. To save Aaron, he betrays Moses, and then turns
   informer against the Golden Calf.

   It is but of little importance to the world to know if Mr. Burr listened
   to an intriguing proposal, but it is of great importance to the
   constituents to know if their representatives in Congress made one. The
   ear can commit no crime, but the tongue may; and therefore the right
   policy is to drop Mr. Burr, as being only the hearer, and direct the whole
   charge against the Federal faction in Congress as the active original
   culprit, or, if the priests will have Scripture for it, as the serpent
   that beguiled Eve.

   The plot of the intrigue was to make Mr. Burr President, on the private
   condition of his agreeing to, and entering into, terms with them, that is,
   with the proposers. Had then the election been made, the country, knowing
   nothing of this private and illegal transaction, would have supposed, for
   who could have supposed otherwise, that it had a President according to
   the forms, principles and intention of the Constitution.

   No such thing. Every form, principle and intention of the Constitution
   would have been violated; and instead of a President, it would have had a
   mute, a sort of image, hand-bound and tongue-tied, the dupe and slave of a
   party, placed on the theater of the United States and acting the farce of
   President.

   It is of little importance, in a constitutional sense, to know what the
   terms to be proposed might be, because any terms other than those which
   the Constitution prescribes to a President are criminal. Neither do I see
   how Mr. Burr, or any other person put in the same condition, could have
   taken the oath prescribed by the Constitution to a President, which is, "I
   do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of
   President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability
   preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."

   How, I ask, could such a person have taken such an oath, knowing at the
   same time that he had entered into the Presidency on terms unknown in the
   Constitution, and private, and which would deprive him of the freedom and
   power of acting as President of the United States, agreeably to his
   constitutional oath?

   Mr. Burr, by not agreeing to terms, has escaped the danger to which they
   exposed him v and the perjury that would have followed, and also the
   punishment annexed thereto. Had he accepted the Presidency on terms
   unknown in the Constitution, and private, and had the transaction
   afterwards transpired (which it most probably would, for roguery is a
   thing difficult to conceal), it would have produced a sensation in the
   country too violent to be quieted, and too just to be resisted; and in any
   case the election must have been void.

   But what are we to think of those Members of Congress, who, having taken
   an oath of the same constitutional import as the oath of the President,
   violate that oath by tampering to obtain a President on private
   conditions? If this is not sedition against the Constitution and the
   country, it is difficult to define what sedition in a representative can
   be.

   Say not that this statement of the case is the effect of personal or party
   resentment. No. It is the effect of sincere concern that such corruption,
   of which this is but a sample, should, in the space of a few years, have
   crept into a country that had the fairest opportunity that Providence ever
   gave, within the knowledge of history, of making itself an illustrious
   example to the world.

   What the terms were, or were to be, it is probable we never shall know; or
   what is more probable that feigned ones, if any, will be given. But from
   the conduct of the party since that time we may conclude that no taxes
   would have been taken off, that the clamor for war would have been kept
   up, new expenses incurred, and taxes and offices increased in consequence;
   and, among the articles of a private nature, that the leaders in this
   seditious traffic were to stipulate with the mock President for lucrative
   appointments for themselves.

   But if these plotters against the Constitution understood their business,
   and they had been plotting long enough to be masters of it, a single
   article would have comprehended everything, which is, That the President
   {thus made) should be governed in all cases whatsoever by a private junta
   appointed by themselves. They could then, through the medium of a mock
   President, have negatived all bills which their party in Congress could
   not have opposed with success, and reduced representation to a nullity.

   The country has been imposed upon, and the real culprits are but few; and
   as it is necessary for the peace, harmony and honor of the Union to
   separate the deceiver from the deceived, the betrayer from the betrayed,
   that men who once were friends in the worst of times should be friends
   again, it is necessary, as a beginning, that this dark business be brought
   to full investigation. Ogden's letter is direct evidence of the fact of
   tampering to obtain a conditional President. He knows the two or three
   Members of Congress that commissioned him, and they know who commissioned
   them.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   FEDERAL CITY,

   Foner's footnote: In the Presidential election of 1800, neither Jefferson,
   Aaron Burr, the New York politician who later turned traitor, nor John
   Adams, had a clear majority of the electoral votes. The election was,
   therefore, thrown into the House of Representatives. The charge that Burr
   intrigued with the Federalists in the House to secure the election has
   been substantiated by historical investigation. Fortunately, however,
   Hamilton did not join in the conspiracy, believing that despite his
   democratic philosophy Jefferson was preferable to Burr. Jefferson was
   finally elected by the House on the thirty-sixth ballot.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   LETTER V I (Philadelphia Aurora of May 14, 1803)

   Religion and War is the cry of the Federalists; Morality and Peace the
   voice of Republicans. The union of morality and peace is congenial but
   that of religion and war is a paradox, and the solution of it is
   hypocrisy.

   The leaders of the Federalists have no judgment; their plans no
   consistency of parts; and want of consistency is the natural consequence
   of want of principle.

   They exhibit to the world the curious spectacle of an Opposition without a
   cause, and conduct without system. Were they, as doctors, to prescribe
   medicine as they practise politics, they would poison their patients with
   destructive compounds.

   There are not two things more opposed to each other than war and religion;
   and yet, in the double game those leaders have to play, the one is
   necessarily the theme of their politics, and the other the text of their
   sermons. The week-day orator of Mars, and the Sunday preacher of Federal
   grace, play like gamblers into each other's hands, and this they call
   religion.

   Though hypocrisy can counterfeit every virtue, and become the associate of
   every vice, it requires a great dexterity of craft to give it the power of
   deceiving. A painted sun may glisten, but it cannot warm. For hypocrisy to
   personate virtue successfully it must know and feel what virtue is, and as
   it cannot long do this it cannot long deceive. When an orator foaming for
   war breathes forth in another sentence a plaintive piety of words, he may
   as well write HYPOCRISY on his front.

   The late attempt of the Federal leaders in Congress (for they acted
   without the knowledge of their constituents) to plunge the country into
   war merits not only reproach but indignation. It was madness, conceived in
   ignorance and acted in wickedness. The head and the heart went partners in
   the crime.

   A neglect of punctuality in the performance of a treaty is made a cause of
   war by the Barbary Powers, and of remonstrance and explanation by
   civilized Powers. The Mahometans of Barbary negotiate by the sword-they
   seize first, and expostulate afterwards; and the Federal leaders have been
   laboring to barbarize the United States by adopting the practise of the
   Barbary States, and this they call honor. Let their honor and their
   hypocrisy go weep together, for both are defeated. Their present
   Administration is too moral for hypocrites, and too economical for public
   spendthrifts.

   A man the least acquainted with diplomatic affairs must know that a
   neglect in punctuality is not one of the legal causes of war, unless that
   neglect be confirmed by a refusal to perform; and even then it depends
   upon circumstances connected with it. The world would be in continual
   quarrels and war, and commerce be annihilated, if Algerine policy was the
   law of nations.

   And were America, instead of becoming an example to the Old World of good
   and moral government and civil manners, or, if they like it better, of
   gentlemanly conduct toward other nations, to set up the character of
   ruffian, that of word and blow, and the blow first, and thereby give the
   example of pulling down the little that civilization has gained upon
   barbarism, her independence, instead of being an honor and a blessing,
   would become a curse upon the world and upon herself.

   The conduct of the Barbary Powers, though unjust in principle, is suited
   to their prejudices, situation and circumstances. The crusades of the
   Church to exterminate them fixed in their minds the unobliterated belief
   that every Christian power was their mortal enemy.

   Their religious prejudices, therefore, suggest the policy, which their
   situation and circumstances protect them in. As a people, they are neither
   commercial nor agricultural, they neither import nor export, have no
   property floating on the seas, nor ships and cargoes in the ports of
   foreign nations. No retaliation, therefore, can be acted upon them, and
   they sin secure from punishment.

   But this is not the case with the United States. If she sins as a Barbary
   Power, she must answer for it as a civilized one. Her commerce is
   continually passing on the seas, exposed to capture, and her ships and
   cargoes in foreign ports to detention and reprisal. An act of war
   committed by her in the Mississippi would produce a war against the
   commerce of the Atlantic States, and the latter would have to curse the
   policy that provoked the former.

   In every point, therefore, in which the character and interest of the
   United States be considered, it would ill become her to set an example
   contrary to the policy and custom of civilized powers, and practised only
   by the Barbary Powers, that of striking before she expostulates.

   But can any man, calling himself a legislator, and supposed by his
   constituents to know something of his duty, be so ignorant as to imagine
   that seizing on New Orleans would finish the affair or even contribute
   toward it? On the contrary it would have made it worse.

   The treaty right of deposit at New Orleans and the right of the navigation
   of the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico are distant things. New Orleans
   is more than a hundred miles in the country from the mouth of the river,
   and, as a place of deposit, is of no value if the mouth of the river be
   shut, which either France or Spain could do, and which our possession of
   New Orleans could neither prevent nor remove.

   New Orleans in our possession, by an act of hostility, would have become a
   blockaded port, and consequently of no value to the Western people as a
   place of deposit. Since, therefore, an interruption had arisen to the
   commerce of the Western states, and until the matter could be brought to a
   fair explanation, it was of less injury to have the port shut and the
   river open than to have the river shut and the port in our possession.

   That New Orleans could be taken required no stretch of policy to plan, nor
   spirit of enterprise to effect. It was like marching behind a man to knock
   him down: and the dastardly slyness of such an attack would have stained
   the fame of the United States. Where there is no danger cowards are bold,
   and Captain Bobadils are to be found in the Senate as well as on the
   stage. Even Gouverneur, on such a march, dare have shown a leg.

   The people of the Western country to whom the Mississippi serves as an
   inland sea to their commerce must be supposed to understand the
   circumstances of that commerce better than a man who is a stranger to it;
   and as they have shown no approbation of the war-whoop measures of the
   Federal senators it becomes presumptive evidence they disapprove them.

   This is a new mortification for those war-whoop politicians; for the case
   is, that finding themselves losing ground and withering away in the
   Atlantic States, they laid hold of the affair of New Orleans in the vain
   hope of rooting and reinforcing themselves in the Western States; and they
   did this without perceiving that it was one of those ill-judged
   hypocritical expedients in politics, that whether it succeeded or failed
   the event would be the same.

   Had their motion (See Foner's footnote at the end of this letter.) [that
   of Ross and Morris] succeeded, it would have endangered the commerce of
   the Atlantic States and ruined their reputation there; and on the other
   hand the attempt to make a tool of the Western people was so badly
   concealed as to extinguish all credit with them.

   But hypocrisy is a vice of sanguine constitution. It flatters and promises
   itself everything; and it has yet to learn, with respect to moral and
   political reputation, it is less dangerous to offend than to deceive.

   To the measures of Administration, supported by the firmness and integrity
   of the majority in Congress, the United States owe, as far as human means
   are concerned, the preservation of peace, and of national honor. The
   confidence which the Western people reposed in the Government and their
   representatives is rewarded with success. They are reinstated in their
   rights with the least possible loss of time; and their harmony with the
   people of New Orleans, so necessary to the prosperity of the United
   States, which would have been broken, and the seeds of discord sown in its
   place, had hostilities been preferred to accommodation, remains
   unimpaired. Have the Federal ministers of the Church meditated on these
   matters? and laying aside, as they ought to do, their electioneering and
   vindictive prayers and sermons, returned thanks that peace is preserved,
   and commerce, without the stain of blood?

   In the pleasing contemplation of this state of things the mind, by
   comparison, carries itself back to those days of uproar and extravagance
   that marked the career of the former Administration, and decides, by the
   unstudied impulse of its own feelings, that something must then have been
   wrong. Why was it that America, formed for happiness, and remote by
   situation and circumstances from the troubles and tumults of the European
   world, became plunged into its vortex and contaminated with its crimes?

   The answer is easy. Those who were then at the head of affairs were
   apostates from the principles of the Revolution. Raised to an elevation
   they had not a right to expect, nor judgment to conduct, they became like
   feathers in the air, and blown about by every puff of passion or conceit.

   Candor would find some apology for their conduct if want of judgment was
   their only defect. But error and crime, though often alike in their
   features, are distant in their characters and in their origin. The one has
   its source in the weakness of the head, the other in the hardness of the
   heart, and the coalition of the two describes the former Administration.

   Had no injurious consequences arisen from the conduct of that
   Administration, it might have passed for error or imbecility, and been
   permitted to die and be forgotten. The grave is kind to innocent offense.
   But even innocence, when it is a cause of injury, ought to undergo an
   inquiry.

   The country, during the time of the former Administration, was kept in
   continual agitation and alarm; and that no investigation might be made
   into its conduct, it intrenched itself within a magic circle of terror,
   and called it a SEDITION LAW. Violent and mysterious in its measures and
   arrogant in its manners, it affected to disdain information, and insulted
   the principles that raised it from obscurity. .

   John Adams and Timothy Pickering were men whom nothing but the accidents
   of the times rendered visible on the political horizon. Elevation turned
   their heads, and public indignation has cast them to the ground. But an
   inquiry into the conduct and measures of that Administration is
   nevertheless necessary.

   The country was put to great expense. Loans, taxes and standing armies
   became the standing order of the day. The militia, said Secretary
   Pickering, are not to be depended upon, and fifty thousand men must be
   raised. For what? No cause to justify such measures has yet appeared. No
   discovery of such a cause has yet been made. The pretended Sedition Law
   shut up the sources of investigation, and the precipitate flight of John
   Adams closed the scene. But the matter ought not to sleep here.

   It is not to gratify resentment, or encourage it in others, that I enter
   upon this subject. It is not in the power of man to accuse me of a
   persecuting spirit. But some explanation ought to be had. The motives and
   objects respecting the extraordinary and expensive measures of the former
   Administration ought to be known. The Sedition Law, that shield of the
   moment, prevented it then, and justice demands it now.

   If the public have been imposed upon, it is proper they should know it;
   for where judgment is to act, or a choice is to be made, knowledge is
   first necessary. The conciliation of parties, if it does not grow out of
   explanation, partakes of the character of collusion or indifference.

   There has been guilt somewhere; and it is better to fix it where it
   belongs, and separate the deceiver from the deceived, than that suspicion,
   the bane of society, should range at large, and sour the public mind. The
   military measures that were proposed and carried on during the former
   Administration could not have for their object the defense of the country
   against invasion. This is a case that decides itself; for it is
   self-evident, that while the war raged in Europe, neither France nor
   England could spare a man to send to America.

   The object, therefore, must be something at home, and that something was
   the overthrow of the representative system of government, for it could be
   nothing else. But the plotters got into confusion and became enemies to
   each other. Adams hated and was jealous of Hamilton, and Hamilton hated
   and despised both Adams and Washington. Surly Timothy stood aloof, as he
   did at the affair of Lexington, and the part that fell to the public was
   to pay the expense.

   But ought a people who, but a few years ago, were fighting the battles of
   the world for liberty had no home but here, ought such a people to stand
   quietly by and see that liberty undermined by apostasy and overthrown by
   intrigue? Let the tombs of the slain recall their recolleclection, and the
   forethought of what their children are to be revive and fix in their
   hearts the love of liberty.

   If the former Administration can justify its conduct, give it the
   opportunity. The manner in which John Adams disappeared from the
   Government renders an inquiry the more necessary. He gave some account of
   himself, lame and confused as it was, to certain Eastern wise men who came
   to pay homage to him on his birthday. But if he thought it necessary to do
   this, ought he not to have rendered an account to the public? They had a
   right to expect it of him.

   In that tete-a-tete account, he says, "Some measures were the effect of
   imperious necessity, much against my inclination." What measures does Mr.
   Adams mean, and what is the imperious necessity to which he alludes?
   "Others (says he) were measures of the Legislature, which, although
   approved when passed, were never previously proposed or recommended by
   me." What measures, it may be asked, were those, for the public have a
   right to know the conduct of their representatives?

   "Some (says he) left to my discretion were never executed, because no
   necessity for them, in my judgment, ever occurred."

   What does this dark apology, mixed with accusation, amount to, but to
   increase and confirm the suspicion that something was wrong?
   Administration only was possessed of foreign official information, and it
   was only upon that information communicated by him publicly or privately,
   or to Congress, that Congress could act; and it is not in the power of Mr.
   Adams to show, from the condition of the belligerent powers, that any
   imperious necessity called for the warlike and expensive measures of his
   Administration.

   What the correspondence between the Administration and Rufus King in
   London, or Quincy Adams in Holland, or Berlin, might be, is but little
   known. The public papers have told us that the former became cup-bearer
   from the London underwriters to Captain Truxton, for

   which, as Minister from a neutral nation, he ought to have been censured.
   It is, however, a feature that marks the politics of the Minister, and
   hints at the character of the correspondence.

   I know that it is the opinion of several members of both Houses of
   Congress, that an inquiry with respect to the conduct of the late
   Administration ought to be gone into. The convulsed state into which the
   country has been thrown will be best settled by a full and fair exposition

   of the conduct of that Administration, and the causes and object of that
   conduct. To be deceived, or to remain deceived, can be the interest of no
   man who seeks the public good; and it is the deceiver only, or one
   interested in the deception, that can wish to preclude inquiry.

   The suspicion against the late Administration is that it was plotting to
   overturn the representative system of government, and that it spread
   alarms of invasions that had no foundation as a pretense for raising and
   establishing a military force as the means of accomplishing that object.

   The law, called the Sedition Law, enacted, that if any person should write
   or publish, or cause to be written or published, any libel [without
   defining what a libel is] against the Government of the United States, or
   either House of Congress, or against the President, he should be punished
   by a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment not
   exceeding two years.

   But it is a much greater crime for a President to plot against a
   constitution and the liberties of the people, than for an individual to
   plot against a President; and consequently, John Adams is accountable to
   the public for his conduct, as the individuals under his Administration
   were to the Sedition Law.

   The object, however, of an inquiry, in this case, is not to punish, but to
   satisfy; and to show, by example, to future Administrations, that an abuse
   of power and trust, however disguised by appearances, or rendered
   plausible by pretense, is one time or another to be accounted for.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   New Jersey, March 12, 1803.

   BORDENTOWN, ON THE DELAWARE,

   Foner's footnote: On February 14, 1803, Senator James Ross of Pittsburgh
   offered a series of resolutions in the United States Senate which called
   on President Jefferson to call out 50,000

   militiamen and to use them together with the land and naval forces of the
   United States, to take possession of such place or places on the island of
   New Orleans as he might deem fit for a place of deposit. The Senator aimed
   to place the responsibility for the consequences of this action on
   Jefferson's shoulders. Basically the resolution was part of the Federalist
   strategy to get the United States into a war with France by seizing New
   Orleans.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   LETTER VII (Trenton (New Jersey) True-American, April 21, 1803)

   The malignant mind, like the jaundiced eye, sees everything through a
   false medium of its own creating. The light of heaven appears stained with
   yellow to the distempered sight of the one, and the fairest actions have
   the form of crimes in the venomed imagination of the other.

   For seven months, both before and after my return to America in October
   last, the apostate papers styling themselves "Federal" were filled with
   paragraphs and essays respecting a letter from Mr. Jefferson to me at
   Paris; and though none of them knew the contents of the letter, nor the
   occasion of writing it, malignity taught them to suppose it, and the lying
   tongue of injustice lent them its aid.

   That the public may no longer be imposed upon by Federal apostasy, I will
   now publish the letter, and the occasion of its being written.

   The treaty negotiated in England by John Jay, and ratified by the
   Washington Administration, had so disgracefully surrendered the right and
   freedom of the American flag, that all the commerce of the United States
   on the ocean became exposed to capture, and suffered in consequence of it.
   The duration of the treaty was limited to two years after the war; and
   consequently America could not, during that period, relieve herself of the
   chains which the treaty had fixed upon her. This being the case, the only
   relief that could come must arise out of something originating in Europe
   that would, in its consequences, extend to America. It had long been my
   opinion that commerce contained within itself the means of its own
   protection; but as the time for bringing forward any new system is not
   always happening, it is necessary to watch its approach and lay hold of it
   before it passes away.

   As soon as the late Emperor Paul of Russia abandoned his coalition with
   England and became a neutral power, this crisis of time, and also of
   circumstances, was then arriving; and I employed it in arranging a plan
   for the protection of the commerce of neutral nations during war that
   might, in its operation and consequences, relieve the commerce of America.
   The plan, with the pieces accompanying it, consisted of about forty pages.
   The Citizen Bonneville, with whom I lived in Paris, translated it into
   French; Mr. Skipwith, the American Consul, Joel Barlow and myself had the
   translation printed and distributed as a present to the foreign ministers
   of all the neutral nations then resident in Paris. This was in the summer
   of 1800.

   It was entitled "Maritime Compact" (in French Pacte Maritime). (The French
   compact is included by foner at the end of this letter.) The plan,
   exclusive of the pieces that accompanied it, consisted of the following
   preamble and article:

   MARITIME COMPACT

   Being an UNARMED ASSOCIATION of Nations for the protection of the Rights
   and Commerce of Nations that shall be neutral in time of War.

   Whereas, the vexations and injuries to which the rights and commerce of
   neutral nations have been, and continue to be, exposed during the time of
   maritime war, render it necessary to establish a law of nations for the
   purpose of putting an end to such vexations and injuries, and to guarantee
   to the neutral nations the exercise of their just rights.

   We, therefore, the undersigned Powers, form ourselves into an association,
   and establish the following as a law of nations on the seas.

   ARTICLE THE FIRST

   Definition of the Rights of Neutral Nations

   The rights of nations, such as are exercised by them in their intercourse
   with each other in time of peace, are, and of right ought to be, the
   rights of neutral nations at all times; because,

   First, those rights not having been abandoned by them, remain with them.

   Secondly, because those rights cannot become forfeited or void, in
   consequence of war breaking out between two or more other nations.

   A war of nation against nation being exclusively the act of the nations
   that make the war, and not the act of the neutral nations, cannot, whether
   considered in itself or in its consequences, destroy or diminish the
   rights of the nations remaining in peace.

   ARTICLE THE SECOND

   The ships and vessels of nations that rest neuter and at peace with the
   world during a war with other nations have a right to navigate freely on
   the seas as they navigated before that war broke out, and to proceed to
   and enter the port or ports of any of the belligerent powers, with the
   consent of that Power, without being seized, searched, visited, or any
   ways interrupted, by the nation or nations with which that nation is at
   war.

   ARTICLE THE THIRD

   For the conservation of the aforesaid rights, we, the undersigned Powers,
   engaging to each other our sacred faith and honor, DECLARE

   That if any belligerent Power shall seize, search, visit, or any ways
   interrupt any ship or vessel belonging to the citizens or subjects of any
   of the Powers composing this Association, then each and all of the said
   undersigned Powers will cease to import, and will not permit to be
   imported into the ports or dominions of any of the said undersigned
   Powers, in any ship or vessel whatever, any goods, wares, or merchandise,
   produced or manufactured in, or exported from, the dominions of the Power
   so offending against the Association hereby, established and proclaimed.

   ARTICLE THE FOURTH

   That all the ports appertaining to any and all of the Powers composing
   this Association shall be shut against the flag of the offending nation.

   ARTICLE THE FIFTH

   That no remittance or payment in money, merchandise, or bills of exchange,
   shall be made by any of the citizens, or subjects, of any of the Powers
   composing this Association, to the citizens or subjects of the offending
   nation, for the term of one year, or until reparation be made. The
   reparation to be _____ times the amount of the damages sustained.

   ARTICLE THE SIXTH

   If any ship or vessel appertaining to any of the citizens or subjects of
   any of the Powers composing this Association shall be seized, searched,
   visited or interrupted by any belligerent nation, or be forcibly prevented
   entering the port of her destination, or be seized, searched, visited, or
   interrupted in coming out of such port, or be forcibly prevented from
   proceeding to any new destination, or be insulted or visited by any agent
   from on board any vessel of any belligerent power, the government or
   executive power of the nation to which the ship or vessel so seized,
   searched, visited or interrupted belongs, shall, on evidence of the fact,
   make public proclamation of the same, and send a copy thereof to the
   government, or executive, of each of the Powers composing this
   Association, who shall publish the same in all the extent of his
   dominions, together with a declaration, that at the expiration of --- days
   after publication, the penal articles of this Association shall be put in
   execution against the offending nation.

   ARTICLE THE SEVENTH

   If reparation be not made within the space of one year, the said
   proclamation shall be renewed for one year more, and so on.

   ARTICLE THE EIGHTH

   The Association chooses for itself a flag to be carried at the mast-head
   conjointly with the national flag of each nation composing this
   Association.

   The flag of the Association shall be composed of the same colors as
   compose the rain-bow, and arranged in the same order as they appear in
   that phenomenon.

   ARTICLE THE NINTH

   And whereas it may happen that one or more of the nations composing this
   Association may be, at the time of forming it, engaged in war or become so
   in future, in that case, the ships and vessels of such nation shall carry
   the flag of the Association bound round the mast to denote that the nation
   to which she belongs is a member of the Association and a respecter of its
   laws.

   N.B. This distinction in the manner of carrying the flag is merely for the
   purpose that neutral vessels having the flag at the mast-head may be known
   at first sight.

   ARTICLE THE TENTH

   And whereas it is contrary to the moral principles of neutrality and peace
   that any neutral nation should furnish to the belligerent Powers, or any
   of them, the means of carrying on war against each other, We, therefore,
   the Powers composing this Association, declare that we will each one for
   itself prohibit in our dominions the exportation or transportation of
   military stores, comprehending gun-powder, cannon and cannon-balls,
   firearms of all kinds, and all kinds of iron and steel weapons used in
   war. Excluding therefrom all kinds of utensils and instruments used in
   civil or domestic life, and every other article that cannot, in its
   immediate state, be employed in war.

   Having thus declared the moral motives of the foregoing article, we
   declare also the civil and political intention thereof, to wit,

   That as belligerent nations have no right to visit or search any ship or
   vessel belonging to a nation at peace and under the protection of the laws
   and government thereof, and as all such visit or search is an insult to
   the nation to which such ship or vessel belongs and to the government of
   the same, We, therefore, the Powers composing this Association, will take
   the right of prohibition on ourselves to whom it properly belongs, and by
   whom only it can be legally exercised, and not permit foreign nations, in
   a state of war, to usurp the right of legislating by proclamaion for any
   of the citizens or subjects of the Powers composing this Association.

   It is, therefore, in order to take away all pretense of search or visit,
   which by being offensive might become a new cause of war, that we will
   provide laws and publish them by proclamation, each in his own dominion,
   to prohibit the supplying or carrying to the belligerent Powers, or either
   of. them, the military stores or articles before mentioned, annexing
   thereto a penalty to be levied or inflicted upon any persons within our
   several dominions transgressing the same.

   And we invite all persons, as well of the belligerent nations as of our
   own, or of any other, to give information of any knowledge they may have
   of any transgressions against the said law, that the offenders may be
   prosecuted.

   By this conduct we restore the word contraband {contra and ban) to its
   true and original signification, which means against law, edict or
   proclamation; and none but the government of a nation can have, or can
   exercise, the right of making laws, edicts or proclamations, for the
   conduct of its citizens or subjects.

   Now We, the undersigned Powers, declare the aforesaid articles to be a law
   of nations at all times, or until a congress of nations shall meet to form
   some law more effectual.

   And we do recommend that, immediately on the breaking out of war between
   any two or more nations, deputies be appointed by all neutral nations,
   whether members of this Association or not, to meet in congress in some
   central place to take cognizance of any violations of the rights

   of neutral nations.

   Signed, etc.

   For the purpose of giving operation to the aforesaid plan of an unarmed
   association, the following paragraph was subjoined:

   It may be judged proper for the order of business, that the Association of
   Nations have a president for a term of years, and the presidency to pass
   by rotation to each of the parties composing the Association.

   In that case, and for the sake of regularity, the first president to be
   the executive power of the most northerly nation composing the
   Association, and his deputy or minister at the congress to be president of
   the congress-and the next most northerly to be vice-president, who shall
   succeed to the presidency, and so on. The line determining the
   geographical situation of each to be the latitude of the capital of each
   nation.

   If this method be adopted it will be proper that the first president be
   nominally constituted in order to give rotation to the rest. In that case
   the following article might be added to the foregoing, viz. The
   constitution of the Association nominates the EMPEROR PAUL to be first
   President of the Association of Nations for the protection of neutral
   commerce and securing the freedom of the seas.

   The foregoing plan, as I have before mentioned, was presented to the
   Ministers of all the neutral nations then in Paris, in the summer of 1800.
   Six copies were given to the Russian General Springporten; and a Russian
   gentleman who was going to Petersburg took two expressly for the purpose
   of putting them into the hands of Paul. I sent the original manuscript, in
   my own handwriting, to Mr. Jefferson, and also wrote him four letters,
   dated the first, fourth, sixth, sixteenth of October, 1800, giving him an
   account of what was then going on in Europe respecting neutral commerce.

   The case was that in order to compel the English Government to acknowledge
   the rights of neutral commerce, and that free ships make free goods, the
   Emperor Paul, in the month of September following the publication of the
   plan, shut all the ports of Russia against England. Sweden and Denmark did
   the same by their ports, and Denmark shut up Hamburg. Prussia shut up the
   Elbe and the Weser.

   The ports of Spain, Portugal and Naples were shut up and, in general, all
   the ports of Italy except Venice, which the Emperor of Germany held; and
   had it not been for the untimely death of Paul, a haw of Nations, founded
   on the authority of nations, for establishing the rights of neutral
   commerce and the freedom of the seas, would have been proclaimed and the
   Government of England must have consented to that law, or the nation must
   have lost its commerce; and the consequence to America would have been
   that such a law would, in a great measure

   if not entirely, have released her from the injuries of Jay's Treaty.

   Of all these matters I informed Mr. Jefferson. This was before he was
   President, and the letter he wrote me after he was President was in answer
   to those I had written to him and the manuscript copy of the plan I had
   sent here. Here follows the letter:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   March 18, 1801.

   WASHINGTON,

   DEAR SIR:

   Your letters of October first, fourth, sixth, sixteenth, came duly to
   hand, and the papers which they covered were, according to your
   permission, published in the newspapers, and in a pamphlet, and under your
   own name. These papers contain precisely our principles, and I hope they
   will be generally recognized here. Determined as we are to avoid, if
   possible, wasting the energies of our people in war and destruction, we
   shall avoid implicating ourselves with the Powers of Europe, even in
   support of principles which we mean to pursue. They have so many other
   interests different from ours that we must avoid being entangled in them.
   We believe we can enforce those principles as to ourselves by peaceable
   means, now that we are lively to have our public councils detached from
   foreign views. The return of our citizens from the frenzy into which they
   had been wrought, partly by ill conduct in France, partly by artifices
   practised upon them, is almost extinct, and will, I believe, become quite
   so. But these details, too minute and long for a letter, will be better
   developed by Mr. [John] Dawson, the bearer of this, a member of the late
   Congress, to whom I refer you for them. He goes in the Maryland, sloop of
   war, which will wait a few days at Havre to receive his letters to be
   written on his arrival at Paris. You expressed a wish to get a passage to
   this country in a public vessel. Mr. Dawson is charged with orders to the
   captain of the Maryland to receive and accommodate you back if you can be
   ready to depart at such a short warning. Rob't R. Livingston is appointed
   Minister Plenipotentiary to the Republic of France, but will not leave
   this, till we receive the ratification of the Convention by Mr. Dawson. I
   am in hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments worthy of
   former times. In these it will be your glory to have steadily labored and
   with as much effect as any man living. That you may long live to continue
   your useful labors and to reap the reward in the thankfulness of nations
   is my sincere prayer. Accept assurances of my high esteem and affectionate
   attachment.

   THOMAS JEFFERSON.

   This, citizens of the United States, is the letter about which the leaders
   and tools of the Federal faction, without knowing its contents or the
   occasion of writing it, have wasted so many malignant falsehoods.

   It is a letter which on account of its wise economy and peaceable
   principles, and its forbearance to reproach, will be read by every good
   man and every good citizen with pleasure; and the faction mortified at its
   appearance will have to regret they forced it into publication. The least
   atonement they can now offer is to make the letter as public as they have
   made their own infamy, and learn to lie no more.

   The same injustice they showed to Mr. Jefferson they showed to me. I had
   employed myself in Europe, and at my own expense, in forming and promoting
   a plan that would, in its operation, have benefited the commerce of
   America; and the faction here invented and circulated an account in the
   papers they employ that I had given a plan to the French for burning all
   the towns on the coast from Savannah to Baltimore.

   Were I to prosecute them for this (and I do not promise that I will not,
   for the liberty of the press is not the liberty of lying) there is not a
   Federal judge, not even one of midnight appointment, but must, from the
   nature of the case, be obliged to condemn them. The faction, however,
   cannot complain they have been restrained in anything. They have had their
   full swing of lying uncontradicted; they have availed themselves,
   unopposed, of all the arts hypocrisy could devise; and the event has been,
   what in all such cases it ever will and ought to be, the ruin of
   themselves.

   The characters of the late and of the present Administrations are now
   sufficiently marked, and the adherents of each keep up the distinction.
   The former Administration rendered itself notorious by outrage,
   coxcombical parade, false alarms, a continual increase of taxes and an
   unceasing clamor for war; and as every vice has a virtue opposed to it the
   present Administration moves on the direct contrary line.

   The question, therefore, at elections is not properly a question upon
   persons, but upon principles. Those who are for peace, moderate taxes and
   mild government will vote for the Administration that conducts itself by
   those principles, in whatever hands that Administration may be.

   There are in the United States, and particularly in the Middle States,
   several religious sects, whose leading moral principle is PEACE. It is,
   therefore, impossible that such persons, consistently with the dictates of
   that principle, can vote for an Administration that is clamorous for war.
   When moral principles, rather than persons, are candidates for power, to
   vote is to perform a moral duty, and not to vote is to neglect a duty.

   That persons who are hunting after places, offices and contracts, should
   be advocates for war, taxes and extravagance, is not to be wondered at;
   but that so large a portion of the people who had nothing to depend upon
   but their industry, and no other public prospect but that of paying taxes,
   and bearing the burden, should be advocates for the same measures, is a
   thoughtlessness not easily accounted for. But reason is recovering her
   empire, and the fog of delusion is clearing away.

   PROPOSALS FOR AN ASSOCIATION OF NATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF

   THE RIGHTS AND COMMERCE OF NATIONS THAT SHALL BE NEUTRAL

   IN TIME OF WAR

   Whereas the inconvenience and injuries to which the commerce of neutral
   nations is exposed in time of maritime war, render it absolutely necessary
   that measures be taken to prevent a continuance of the same, and to secure
   to them during the time of such war the exercise of their just rights- We
   the undersigned, each in behalf of the Nation he represents, enter into
   the following association.

   Art. 1.

   That the common rights of nations, such as are exercised by them in time
   of Peace in their intercourse with each, ought not and cannot of Right, be
   injured or interrupted in consequence of war breaking out between any two
   or more of them.

   2

   That ships and vessels of nations that shall be neutral during such war,
   have a right to pass unmolested on the seas and to enter the port, or
   ports, of any of the belligerent powers unmolested by the party with which
   that nation is at war. Provided that nothing herein contained shall be
   construed to give to any ship or vessel a right of entering such ports,
   otherwise than in conformity to laws of the country to which it shall
   enter; nor to give protection to any cargoes prohibited by the laws of
   that country.

   3

   For the maintenance of the aforesaid Rights, we the undersigned powers
   declare, and for the performance thereof bind ourselves in honor to each
   other that if any belligerent power shall seize or injuriously molest any
   ship or vessel belonging to the citizens or subjects of any of the powers
   composing this association, and all and each one of the parties composing
   the same will cease to import and will not permit to be imported in any
   ship or vessel whatever any goods, wares, or merchandise, manufactured or
   unmanufactured, from the nation so offending against this association,
   that all the ports appertaining to the powers composing this association
   shall be shut against the flag ships and vessels of the of Tending nation
   and furthermore that no remittances in money, goods and bills of exchange
   shall be made by any of the citizens and subjects of any of the powers
   composing this association to the citizens or subjects of the nation so of
   Tending for the space of one year or until reparation be made as is
   hereinafter expressed.

   4

   When any ship or vessel belonging to any of the citizens or subjects
   composing this association shall be seized by the ship or ships of the
   belligerent powers and be forced into port, or be forcibly prevented
   entering the port to which she is going, or be seizedor molested in coming
   therefrom, the Executive government of the nation to which the shipor
   vessel so seized or molested belong, shall immediately on ascertaining the
   fact, make proclamation of same, and send a copy thereof to the executive
   of each of the powers composing this association, each of which shall
   within ten days after receiving the same make publication thereof
   subjoining thereto the following proclamation:

   We therefore the of do in our own name, and in the name of the nations
   associated for the protection of the Rights of neutral nations of which
   association we are a member, declare, that all goods, wares, and
   merchandise produced or manufactured in the country or Dominions of (here
   insert the name of the offending nation) are forbidden to be imported into
   any of our ports for the term of one year, or until reparation be made to
   the party injured; the representation to be three times the value of the
   vessel and cargo according to the invoice, and that in the meantime all
   ships and vessels of (here insert the name of the offending nation), are
   forbidden to enter any of our ports, and that all remittances from any of
   our to the of in money goods or bills of exchange do cease until
   reparation be made as aforesaid.

   5

   In case reparation be not made within the space of one year, the
   proclamation shall be renewed for the space of one year more and so on.

   6

   The association establishes a flag for itself to be carried by every ship
   and vessel of every nation composing this association. This flag to be a
   pennant at the head of the main mast, and is to be composed of the same
   colors as compose the Rainbow, and arranged in the same order as they
   appear in that Phenomenon.

   7

   The ships of the Powers that now are, or in any future time shall be in a
   state of war, and members of this association, shall not carry the flag at
   the masthead, but the flag shall be bound round the main mast to denote
   they are members of the association and bound to respect the laws thereof.

   8

   As soon as seven of the Powers of Europe, or six of them with the United
   States of America shall have subscribed to this association, a Congress,
   composed of one member or more, from each power shall meet to confer upon
   what further measures, shall be adopted for securing the Rights of neutral
   nations and establishing the permanent code of marine laws.

   LETTER VIII (Philadelphia Aurora of June 7, 1805)

   Much has been said, and much remains to be said, of that undescribed and
   undescribable nothing, called federalism. It is a word without a meaning,
   and designates a faction that has no principles. Ask a man who called
   himself a federalist, what federalism is, and he cannot tell you. Ask him,
   what are its principles, and he has none to give. Federalism, then, with
   respect to government, is similar to atheism with respect to religion, a
   nominal nothing without principles. The federal papers, especially those
   of New England, have often said, that "religion and federalism must go
   together." But if their religion is related to their federalism; if it is
   as destitute of morals as their federalism is of principles; and I fear it
   is; it will do them no good in this world or the next. It will condemn
   them as imposters and hypocrites in both.

   Those who once figured as leaders under the assumed and fraudulent name of
   federalism (but who are since gone, not into honorable and peaceable
   retirement, like John Dickinson and Charles Thomson (John Dickinson, the
   respectable author of the farmer's letters before the revolution began.
   Charles Thomson, the faithful secretary of the old congress during the
   revolution.- Author.) but into obscurity and oblivion, like John Adams and
   John Jay), had some plans in contemplation which they concealed from their
   deluded adherents, but those plans can be discovered through the gauzy,
   but clumsy, veil of conduct those leaders adopted. "No cover is large
   enough to hide itself" says the Spanish proverb.

   It requires more artifice and management to disguise and conceal sinister
   designs than schemers are aware of. A man never turns a rogue but he turns
   a fool. He incautiously lets out something by which those he intended to
   cheat or impose upon begin to find him out. Whereas truth is a straight
   forward thing, even an ignorant man will not blunder in a true story-nor
   can an artful man keep a false story straight.

   But those leaders, supposing themselves in a higher position than what
   common observation would reach, presume, on their supposed consequence and
   the expected credulity of their adherents, to impose on the nation by
   clamorous and false pretences, for the purpose of raising a standing army
   of fifty thousand men; and when they had got that army the mask would have
   been thrown off, and their deluded adherents would have paid the price of
   their duplicity by being enslaved.

   But in the midst of this career of delusion and imposition, those leaders
   became fools. They did everything they ought not to have done. They
   advocated plans which showed that their intention and their cause were not
   good. They labored to provoke war. They opposed everything which led to
   peace. They loaded the country with vexatious and unnecessary taxes, and
   then opposed the reduction of them. They opposed a reduction of useless
   offices that served no other purpose than to maintain their own partisans
   at the expense of the public. In short, they run themselves a-ground
   first, by their extravagance and next by their folly. Blinded by their own
   vanity, and though bewildered in the wilderness of their own projects,
   they foolishly supposed themselves above detection. They had neither sense
   enough to know, nor logic enough to perceive, that as we can reason upward
   from cause to effect, so also can we reason downward from effect to cause,
   and discover, by the means they make use of, the motives and object of any
   party; for when the means are bad, the motive and the end to be obtained
   cannot be good.

   The manners also, and language of any party is another clue that leads to
   a discovery of their real characters. When the cause and principles of a
   party are good, its advocates make use of reason, argument, and good
   language. Truth can derive no advantage from boisterous vulgarity. But
   when the motives and principles of a party are bad, it is necessary to
   conceal them; and its abettors having principles they dare to acknowledge
   and cannot defend, avoid everything of argument, and take refuge in abuse
   and falsehood.

   The federal papers are an instance of the justness of this remark. Their
   pages are crowded with abuse, but never with argument; for they have no
   principles to argue from: and as to falsehood, it is become so naturally
   their mother tongue, especially in New England, that they seem to have
   lost the power as well as the disposition, of speaking the truth. Those
   papers have been of great aid to the republican cause, not only by the
   additional disgrace they have brought on their own disgraceful faction,
   but by serving as a foil to set off, with greater eclat, the decency and
   well principled arguments of the republican papers. I have had some
   experience, perhaps as much as most men have had in the various turns of
   political life, but I never saw a greater set of fools undertake to
   conduct a party than the leaders of the federalists have been, and the
   editors of their papers. They correspond to the story told of a man who
   was become so proud and famous for lying that he disdained speaking truth
   lest he should lose his character.

   Cannot those stupid people see, or, according to some dogmas, of their
   own, are their hearts hardened, that they shall not see, that the more
   vulgar and abusive they are, the more ground they lose in the estimation
   of the public. Every election, especially in New England, is wearing them
   down, till they will be lost even as a faction, and Massachusetts and
   Connecticut will recover their former character. Everything this faction
   does hastens its exit. The abusive vulgarity of Hulbert, a pettyfogging
   attorney of Sheffield, in Massachusetts, and one of its legislators, has
   contributed to bring forward the funeral. In his late unprincipled speech
   in the legislature of that state, he has driven another nail in the coffin
   of the federal faction, and I leave to the New England Palladium to clinch
   it. It is a paper worthy of being the buffoon of such a faction, and of
   such an hypocritical impostor- Thus much for the character of parties and
   the method of ascertaining their motives and objects. I now proceed to
   other matters.

   When I returned to America in November 1802 (after an absence of more than
   fourteen years) I found the country in a state of disquietude. The people
   were divided into two classes, under the names of republicans and
   federalists, and in point of numbers appeared to be nearly balanced. The
   republicans were the majority in congress, and all the administration were
   of that description; but they were assailed with outrageous abuse in the
   federal papers, but never by argument. I am enough acquainted with life
   and the world, to know, that abuse is the evidence of want of argument,
   and that those who use it, have no right on their side. There is a
   dignified calmness in conscious rectitude, which descends not to abuse. It
   can reason but it cannot rage. It cannot quit the strong fortress of
   rectitude to skirmish in the fields of vulgarity.

   It was not difficult to perceive, that this division and agitation arose
   from some reports spread during the administration of John Adams, and in
   the latter time of General Washington, which one part of the people
   believed, and the other did not; and the point to be ascertained was
   whether those reports were true or false. If either of those cases could
   be ascertained effectually, it would unite the people. The chief of those
   reports, was the danger of an invasion from France; and this was made a
   cause for borrowing, by loan, at the high rate of eight per cent, laying
   on a land tax of two million dollars annually; besides a greater number of
   other taxes; and for raising a standing army of fifty thousand men.

   Now, if the danger was real, it ought to have been provided against. If it
   was a fiction, with the design of raising an army to be employed to
   accomplish some concealed purpose, the country ought to be informed of it.
   The party styling themselves federalists appeared to believe the danger,
   and the republicans to ridicule it as fabulous; and in this state the
   parties stood. It was, however, equally the interest of both to know the
   truth, on which ever side the truth might fall.

   Being at Washington in the winter of 1802-3, I talked with some members of
   congress on the subject, particularly with Mr. Breckenridge, senator from
   Kentucky, the same person who brought in the bill for repealing John
   Adams's judiciary law, and the midnight appointments made in the
   consequence of it. This repeal saved the country thirty-two thousand
   dollars annually, besides freeing it from an intended judiciary despotism.

   I spoke to him of the propriety of congress appointing a committee, or by
   some other method as they might think proper, to enquire into the conduct
   of the former administration, that of John Adams, and to call upon him to
   produce the information whether official or otherwise, which he went upon,
   if he had any, for putting the country to such vast expence, under the
   idea, real or pretended, of an invasion from France. This would be giving
   John Adams a fair chance of clearing himself, if he could, from the
   suspicion that his administration was a gross imposition on the public;
   and on the other hand, if the imposition should be proved, it would
   enlighten the country, and put it on its guard against future impositions.

   Mr. Breckenridge agreed with me in the propriety and fitness of the
   measure. He saw that information was wanted, and that it would be useful,
   because when the truth should be known, it would compose the people. John
   Adams had gone away in what may be called a clandestine manner, without
   surrendering into the hands of his successor, as he ought to have done in
   person, any account of the affairs of the executive department, foreign or
   domestic. There are no papers or documents that I know of, and I believe
   there are none, because there can be none in the secretary of state's
   office, that will justify John Adams in the expence to which his
   administration put the country; or even afford ground for suspicion that
   either France or England intended to invade the United States. For what
   purpose then was an army to be raised. The projectors of such a measure
   must have had some object in view, and as that object has never been
   explained, it ought to be enquired into. It is bad policy, and also a bad
   precedent, expecially in public affairs, to let imposition slide away
   without detection.

   At the time I talked with Mr. Breckenridge on this subject, I expected
   that Mr. Shjpwith formerly (Mr. Skip with resigned the consulship during
   the administration of John Adams. I believe on account of a rude insulting
   letter he received from Timothy Pickering then secretary of state. Mr.
   Jefferson re-appointed Mr. Skipwith.-Author.) and at this time, American
   consul at Paris, and Joel Barlow would soon arrive, and I did not wish the
   enquiry to be gone into till they came. After the fall of Robespierre and
   the establishment of the directory constitution, these two gentlemen and
   myself (Mr. Monroe being recalled) had better opportunities of knowing the
   sentiments and intentions of the French government with respect to
   American than other persons had; and they can be evidence equally with
   myself, that no intention existed in the French government to invade
   America; nor was any preparation made for such an attempt, nor could it be
   made. The possibility of such a thing did not exist. The French navy at
   that time was nearly annihilated; her ports blockaded by the British; and
   she had to fight by land, single handed, against almost the whole of
   Europe. She had it not in her power to spare a regiment, much less could
   she spare an army, to send to America; and if she could have spared one,
   she had not the means of transporting it, nor the convoy to protect it.
   All the circumstances as well as the evidence that can be provided, will
   show that the administration of John Adams was a fraudulent and expensive
   imposition on the country; and that the army to be raised was intended for
   some secret purpose, and not for the purpose of defence. If John Adams was
   not conscious of something wrong, and apprehensive of some consequences,
   why did he abscond in the hasty and private manner he did? or why did his
   partisans want to put Aaron Burr in the presidency. In the days of the
   black cockades John Adams had one so enormous and so valiantly large, that
   he appeared to be suspended by it; but when his midnight hour arrived, his
   valor fled and himself also.

   The voluntary embassy of Dr. Logan to Paris appears to have disconcerted
   John's administration, and discomfited its leaders; because it served to
   expose and put an end to their projects. When Dr. Logan called on Timothy
   Pickering, secretary of state, with Mr. Skipwith's dispatches from Paris,
   Timothy, before he knew their contents, though Logan knew the whole, began
   to talk of invasions and dangers, and the necessity of preparation. "It
   may be very well" said Logan, "to have the militia in good order." "The
   militia, sir!" said Timothy, "the militia never did any good and never
   will. We must have any army of fifty thousand men." When Logan was coming
   away, Timothy said to him at the door, "Sir, the government don't thank
   you." (Timothy Pickering's reflection on the militia deserves a rebuff. It
   was the militia that fought at Bunker's hill, under Warren, a military
   general. It was by the aid of numerous reinforcements of militia to join
   General Gates that Burgoyne was taken. It was by a volunteer militia under
   Starf{, a volunteer general, that Col. Baum, a Hessian officer, was
   defeated at Bennington, in Vermont, which was the prelude to the capture
   of Burgoyne. But perhaps Timothy reasons from himself; and if he makes
   himself the standard by which to judge of the merits of the militia there
   is ground for his saying the militia never did any good and never will.
   Timothy's first public employment was very harmless, that of a teacher of
   psalmody. When the revolution began he learned the manual exercise, and
   then taught it. He was afterwards appointed a colonel of a regiment of
   militia, and when the affairs of Lexington and Concord took place, April
   19, 1775, and the British were retreating from Concord back to Boston, an
   order was sent to Timothy, to march with his regiment, and post himself at
   a certain place to cut off their retreat. Timothy marched but he stopped
   short of the place, and drew up his men, and went to prayers, till the
   British passed it. His prayers saved him from the dangers of that day. I
   do not know that he sung psalms. Perhaps not. The enemy might have
   overheard him. Had Timothy done his duty on that occasion, and put his
   trust in God without loitering away his time, the whole party of the
   British, about two thousand, must have been prisoners, for they could not
   have got back into Boston; and the slaughter at Bunker's hill, the 17th of
   June following, could not have taken place. The whole force of the British
   at Boston at that time was about four thousand; one half of which were on
   this expedition.-Author.)

   When Logan waited on General Washington, who had been then appointed
   lieutenant general of the army then raising, of which John was commander
   in chief!-the General received him coldly and sternly, and said to him in
   a haughty tone, "and pray sir, what right have you, that are but a private
   citizen, to interfere in matters of government?" Logan very prudently
   replied, "I have no answer, sir, to make to that," and withdrew. The state
   of Pennsylvania, soon after this, elected Dr. Logan one of its senators in
   congress.

   Circumstances often unriddle and explain themselves, and it happens so in
   this case; for if the administration, and those leaders connected with it,
   were sincere in their belief that the danger was real, and that the
   country (as Gouverneur Morris expressed it, in his funeral oration on
   Hamilton) was "menaced with dangers from without," and that France
   intended an invasion; and if, at the same time, they had no concealed
   object in contemplation themselves, they would welcome the messenger that
   should bring them good tidings that all was well. But if, on the contrary,
   they new they were acting a fraud, and heating the country with falsehoods
   and false alarms for the purpose of procuring loans, levying new taxes,
   and raising an army to accomplish some concealed purpose that could not be
   accomplished without that treachery, they would be enraged at him; and
   this accounts for the rude reception Dr. Logan received from that
   administration. Thousands who supported that administration from a belief
   that it was acting right, have since abandoned it from a conviction that
   it acted deceitfully wrong, and this also accounts for the great majority
   at the last presidential election. We have no alarms now, nor should we
   have had any then, if the present administration had existed at that time.

   It requires only a prudent and honest administration to preserve America
   always in peace. Her distance from the European world frees her from its
   intrigues. But when men get into power, whose heads, like the head of John
   Adams, are filled with "strange notions" and counter revolutionary
   principles and projects, things will be sure to go wrong. John Adams, who
   was more the dupe of a party than the leader of it, entered on the office
   of president with his head turned by the elevation he was lifted to; and
   his principles (if ever he had any), corrupted. He turned out to be a
   counter revolutionist; and if the concealed objects of his administration
   had succeeded, the federal constitution would have been destroyed, and
   that by persons under the assumed and fraudulent name of federalists.

   "As General Washington (said John Adams) has no children, it will be right
   to make the government in the family of Lund Washington." Perhaps John
   intended this as a sly introduction of himself and his hopeful son Quincy,
   in preference to any of the Washingtons; for this same John Adams was one
   of the chiefs of a party in congress at Yorktown in Pennsylvania, in the
   latter end of the year 1777 and beginning of '78, for dismissing
   Washington from the command of the army, because, they said, he was not
   capable of it and did nothing. Yet under John's administration the name of
   Washington was made use of, for the purpose of introducing and covering a
   counter revolutionary system. Such is the inconsistency of faction and of
   men who have no fixed principles!

   The independence of America would have added but little to her own
   happiness, and been of no benefit to the world, if her government had been
   formed on the corrupt models of the old world. It was the opportunity of
   beginning the world anew, as it were; and of bringing forward a new system
   of government in which the rights of all men should be preserved that gave
   value to independence. The pamphlet Common Sense, the first work I ever
   published, embraced both those objects. Mere independence might at some
   future time, have been effected and established by arms, without
   principle, but a just system of government could not. In short, it was the
   principle,' at that time, that produced the independence; for until the
   principle spread itself abroad among the people, independence was not
   thought of, and America was fighting without an object. Those who know the
   circumstances of the times I speak of, know this to be true.

   I am not persecuting John Adams, nor any other man, nor did I ever
   persecute any; but I see the propriety, and even the necessity of
   instituting an enquiry into the confused state of affairs during his
   administration. All the circumstances and the evidence combined with them,
   justify the suspicion that during that administration the country was
   grossly imposed upon, and put to so great and unnecessary expence, which
   the present administration has to pay off; and that some concealed
   counter-revolutionary scheme was in contemplation. The leaders,
   separately, might hide from each other what his own particular object was.
   Each of them might have a different one. But all of them agreed in the
   preliminary project, that of raising an army: and the case would have
   been, that when they had collected that army, they would have broken into
   distinct parties, like the generals of Alexander's army, and destroyed
   each other, to decide who should be the reigning usurper.

   Symptoms of disgust had already begun to appear among the chiefs. Hamilton
   despised Washington; Adams was jealous of Hamilton; and Hamilton had a
   perfect contempt for Adams. But in the end, John, I believe would have
   come poorly off. He was not a man of the sword, but only of the cockade.

   I purposely delayed entering upon this subject till the presidential
   election should be over. Had I published it before that time the clamor of
   faction would have said it was an electioneering trick. Now, they cannot
   say it. The choice made at that election was the spontaneous choice of the
   people, and is therefore the more honorable both to the electors and the
   elected. The country at this time, compared with what it was two or three
   years ago, is in a state of tranquility; and in a fit disposition of
   calmness to take the matters herein stated into consideration before the
   next meeting of congress. It is by keeping a country well informed upon
   its affairs, and discarding from its councils everything of mystery, that
   harmony is preserved or restored among the people, and confidence reposed
   in the government.
