   To the Council of the Five Hundred  January 28, 1798

   PARIS,

   CITIZENS REPRESENTATIVES :

   Though it is not convenient to me, in the present situation of my affairs,
   to subscribe to the loan toward the descent upon England, my economy
   permits me to make a small patriotic donation. I send a hundred livres,
   and with it all the wishes of my heart for the success of the descent, and
   a voluntary offer of any service I can render to promote it.

    There will be no lasting peace for France, nor for the world, until the
   tyranny and corruption of the English government be abolished, and
   England, like Italy, become a sister Republic. As to those men, whether in
   England, Scotland, or Ireland, who, like Robespierre in France, are

   covered with crimes, they, like him, have no other resource than
   committing more. But the mass of the people are the friends of liberty:
   tyranny and taxation oppress them, but they deserve to be free.

    Accept, Citizens Representatives, the congratulations of an old colleague
   in the dangers we have passed and on the happy prospect before us.

   Salut et Respect.

   THOMAS PAINE.
