   Second Street Jan. 24. 1782

   Sir

   As some convenience may arise to you in your difficult office by knowing
   matters before hand I communicate to you the following.

   Some officers of the Army were with me this morning, by deputation, to
   request me to draw up a petition for them to general Washington respecting
   their pay, and I find it is intended to be a general one &mdash; As I am sensible
   of the inability of the Treasury to answer immediate demands, and that it
   is renewing care, to the general who already knows their wants I entered
   into some conversation with them on the subject by mentioning &mdash; that the
   state of the Treasury was now improving &mdash; that the Taxes laid this year were
   real and valuable and that any necessary demands just now might rather
   injure than promote their interest, and that though I would wish to oblige
   them, I should rather they would in this instance excuse me, as I know,
   exclusive of the reasons already mentioned it would be only adding to the
   distress of the general &mdash;

   From some expressions they used, I believe they do not expect an immediate
   payment, but only a payment of their interest. I forbore to enquire much as
   I wished them to suspend their petition &mdash; But if the payment of the
   interest will satisfy them for the present, and the Treasury can do it, or
   begin to do it, it may answer a good purpose &mdash; If you should hear no more
   on the subject it will be well &mdash; if you should, the hint may be of some
   use, as it would be a pity, and might be a misfortune, to have any thing like
   the scene of last year reacted

   I am Sir your Ob. Hble Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
