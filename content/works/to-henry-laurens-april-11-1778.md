   To Henry Laurens  April 11, 1778

   LANCASTER,

   SIR:

   I take the liberty of mentioning an affair to you which I think deserves
   the attention of Congress. The persons who came from Philadelphia some
   time ago with, or in company with, a flag from the enemy, and were taken
   up and committed to Lancaster jail for attempting to put off counterfeit
   Continental money, were yesterday brought to trial and are likely to
   escape by means of an artful and partial construction of an Act of this
   State for punishing such offences. The Act makes it felony to counterfeit
   the money emitted by Congress, or to circulate such counterfeits knowing
   them to be so. The offenders' counsel explained the word "emitted" to have
   only a retrospect meaning by supplying the idea of "which have been"
   "emitted by Congress. Therefore say they the Act cannot be applied to any
   money emitted after the date of the Act. I believe the words "emitted by
   Congress" means only, and should be understood, to distinguish Continental
   money from other money, and not one time from another time. It has, as I
   conceive, no reference to any particular time, but only to the particular
   authority which distinguishes money so emitted from money emitted by the
   state. It is meant only as a description of the money, and not of the time
   of striking it, but includes the idea of all time as inseparable from the
   continuance of the authority of Congress. But be this as it may; the
   offense is Continental and the consequences of the same extent. I can have
   no idea of any particular State pardoning an offence against all, or even
   their letting an offender slip legally who is accountable to all and every
   State alike for his crime. The place where he commits it is the least
   circumstance of it. It is a mere accident and has nothing or very little
   to do with the crime itself. I write this hoping the information will
   point out the necessity of the Congress supporting their emissions by
   claiming every offender in this line where the present deficiency of the
   law or the partial interpretation of it operates to the injustice and
   injury of the whole continent.

   I beg leave to trouble you with another hint. Congress I learn has
   something to propose through the Commissioners on the cartel respecting
   the admission and stability of the Continental currency. As forgery is a
   sin against all men alike, and reprobated by all civil nations, query,
   would it not be right to require of General Howe the persons of Smithers
   and others in Philadelphia suspected of this crime; and if he, or any
   other commander, continues to conceal or protect them in such practices,
   that, in such case, the Congress will consider the crime as the act of the
   commander-in-chief. Howe affects not to know the Congress-he ought to be
   made to know them; and the apprehension of personal consequences may have
   some effect on his conduct.

   I am, dear sir, Your obedient and humble servant,

   T. PAINE.

   Since writing the foregoing the prisoners have had their trial; the one is
   acquitted and the other convicted only of a fraud; for as the law now
   stands, or rather as it is explained, the counterfeiting-or circulating
   counterfeits-is only a fraud. I do not believe it was the intention of the
   Act to make it so, and I think it misapplied lenity in the Court to suffer
   such an explanation, because it has a tendency to invite and encourage a
   species of treason, the most prejudicial to us of any or all the other
   kinds. I am aware how very difficult it is to make a law so very perfect
   at first as not to be subject to false or perplexed conclusions. There
   never was but one Act (said a Member of the House of Commons) which a man
   might not creep out of, i.e. the Act which obliges a man to be buried in
   woolen.

   T. P.
