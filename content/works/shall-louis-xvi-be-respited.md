   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Paine refused to support the Girondin proposal calling for a popular
   referendum to decide the king's fate. At the same time, however, while
   voting the king guilty of treason, he refused to vote for the death
   penalty. He had this address translated and read to the French National
   Convention on January 19, 1793 by Bancal, a Girondist delegate. Marat, the
   great Jacobin leader, interrupted the speaker to charge that the
   translation was incorrect and that the sentiments could not be those of
   Paine. The incident revealed that troubled times were in store for Paine.

   **

   THE decision come to in the Convention yesterday in favor of death has
   filled me with genuine sorrow-

   Marat {interrupting)-I deny the right of Thomas Paine to vote on such a
   subject; as he is a Quaker, of course his religious views run counter to
   the infliction of capital punishment. (There is considerable disorder,
   which, however, is allayed by shouts for "free speech." Then Bancal
   continues the reading of the translation.)

   I may lay claim to the possession of a certain amount of experience; I
   have taken no inconsiderable part in the struggle for freedom during the
   Revolution of the United States of America: it is a cause to which I have
   devoted almost twenty years of my existence. Liberty and humanity have
   ever been the words that best expressed my thoughts, and it is my
   conviction that the union of these two principles, in all cases, tends
   more than anything also to insure the grandeur of a nation. I am aware of
   the excitement and anger aroused by the perils to which France, and
   especially Paris, have been subjected; and yet, if we could only catch a
   glimpse of the future, long after all this excitement and anger have
   passed away, it is not unlikely that the action which you have sanctioned
   today will assume the aspect of having been performed from a spirit of
   revenge rather than from a spirit of justice. (Murmurs.) My solicitude for
   the welfare of France has now been transformed into concern for her honor.

   Should I, after returning to America, spend my leisure in writing a
   history of the French Revolution, it would give me greater satisfaction to
   be able to set down a multitude of mistakes prompted by a feeling of
   compassion rather than to record a single deed prompted by even a just
   severity. I voted against the resolution that the Convention should submit
   its judgment to the decision of the people; I did so, however, in the
   expectation that it would not decide in favor of death, but rather in
   favor of a penalty for which I believe the nation would have voted;
    namely, imprisonment during the war and exile afterward. Such a
   punishment, embracing as it would the whole family, would be more
   effective than any other that can be imagined.

   I have not altered my views as to the undesirability of leaving the
   punishment to the decision of the primary assemblies, for I consider that
   there is a better method of dealing with the matter. The Convention has
   been chosen in order that it may establish a constitution, which
   constitution must be subsequently ratified by the primary assemblies. As a
   necessary consequence, another assembly must then be elected. Now, it is
   not probable that the Convention now sitting can continue for more than
   five or six months.

   The selection that shall be made of the new deputies will voice the
   opinion of the people as strongly on the justice of your sentence as would
   the result of an appeal to the primary assemblies. As then, our functions
   must soon terminate, we should be careful to pay due regard to the welfare
   of those who shall succeed us. We should not, by adopting measures
   calculated to enlarge the number of our enemies or to reduce that of our
   friends-especially when our financial position may be worse than it is
   to-day-place difficulties in the path of the latter. Let us not,
   therefore, decide any question hastily or rashly.

   France's sole ally is the United States of America. It is the only nation
   upon which France can depend for a supply of naval stores, because all the
   kingdoms of northern Europe are either now waging war against her, or
   shortly will be. Now, it is an unfortunate circumstance that the
   individual whose fate we are at present determining has always been
   regarded by the people of the United States as a friend to their own
   revolution. Should you come, then, to the resolution of putting Louis to
   death, you will excite the heartfelt sorrow of your ally. If I were able
   to speak the French language, I would appear in person at your bar, and,
   in the name of the American people, ask that Louis be respited-

   Thuriot-The words you are reading are not those of Thomas Paine.

   Marat-I denounce the translator. Such opinions are not Thomas Paine's. The
   translation is incorrect.

   Garran-It is a correct translation of the original, which I have
   read.(Great confusion, Paine ascends the tribune and, standing beside
   Bancal, declares that the opinions just delivered are his own.)

   Bancal continues to read the translation:

   It is my fondest desire that when an ambassador has been sent by your
   executive committee to Philadelphia, he may carry with him the tidings
   from France of the respite granted by the National Convention to Louis,
   solely because of its friendship for America. In the name of the citizens
   of that Republic, I beg that you delay the execution. Do not, I beseech
   you, bestow upon the English tyrant the satisfaction of learning that the
   man who helped America, the land of my love, to burst her fetters, has
   died on the scaffold.

   Marat (rushing into the middle of the chamber)-Paine's reason for voting
   against the death penalty is that he is a Quaker.

   Paine-I have been influenced in my vote by public policy as well as by
   moral reasons.
