Title: Observations on Jay's Treaty
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:52 EDT 2014

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   After he was released from prison Paine stayed as a guest for
   eighteen months at the house of James Monroe. It was there in Paris, early
   in 1795, that he penned these observations on Jay's Treaty with Great
   Britain. This agreement was signed in London in November, 1794, and it is
   not clear just how Paine knew of its terms before they were made public.
   At any rate, his criticism of the treaty was echoed by many people in
   America after its text was published in the Philadelphia Aurora of July 2,
   1795. For the agreement obtained no assurance that the British would stop
   the seizure of American ships or the impressment of American seamen. In
   return for Britain's agreement to give up the Northwestern posts and for
   permission for American vessels to enter the British West Indies, Jay
   agreed to the prohibition of export from the United States, in American
   vessels, of sugar, coffee, cocoa and cotton. He also agreed to permit
   British creditors to collect private debts from southern planters in
   America. Washington signed the treaty reluctantly, and only because he was
   led to believe that the only alternative was a war with England. But his
   action alienated many people including his fellow-planters in the South.
   The criticism of the President, heretofore subdued, was now openly
   expressed.

   The United States of America are negotiating with Spain respecting the
   free navigation of the Mississippi1, and the territorial limits of this
   large river, in conformity with the treaty of peace, with England dated
   thirtieth November, 1782. As the brilliant successes of the French
   Republic have forced England to grant us what was in all justice our due,
   so the continuation of the prosperity of the Republic, will force Spain to
   make a treaty with us on the points in controversy.

   Since it is certain that all that we shall obtain from Spain will be due
   to the victories of France, and as the inhabitants of the western part of
   the United States (which part contains or covers more than half the United
   States), have decided to claim their rights to the free navigation of the
   Mississippi, would it not be a wiser policy for the Republican Government
   (who have only to command to obtain) to arrogate all the merit, by making
   our demands to Spain one of the conditions of France, to consent to
   restore peace to the Castilians?

   They have only to declare they will not make peace, or that they will
   support with all their might, the just reclamations of their allies
   against these Powers-against England for the surrender of the frontier
   posts, and for the indemnities due through their depredations on our
   trade, and against Spain for our territorial limits, and the free
   navigation of the Mississippi. This declaration would certainly not
   prolong the war a single day more, nor cost the Republic an obole, while
   it would assure all the merit of success to France, and besides produce
   all the good effects mentioned above.

   It may perhaps be observed that the negotiation is already finished with
   England, and perhaps in a manner which will not be approved of by France.
   That may be (though the terms of this arrangement may not be known); but
   as to Spain, the negotiation is still pending, and it is evident that if
   France makes the above Declaration as to this Power (which declaration
   would be a demonstrative proof of what she would have done in the other
   case if circumstances had required it), she would receive the same credit
   as if the Declaration had been made relatively to the two Powers.

   In fact, the decree or resolution (and perhaps this last would be
   preferable) can be worded in terms which would declare that in case the
   arrangement with England were not satisfactory, France will nevertheless,
   maintain the just demands of America against that Power. A like
   declaration, in case Mr. Jay should do anything reprehensible, and which
   might even be approved of in America, would certainly raise the reputation
   of the French Republic to the most eminent degree of splendor, and lower
   in proportion that of her enemies.

   It is very certain that France cannot better favor the views of the
   British party in America, and wound in a most sensible manner the
   Republican Government of this country, than by adopting a strict and
   oppressive policy with regard to us. Everyone knows that the injustices
   committed by the privateers and other ships belonging to the French
   Republic against our navigation were causes of exultation and joy to this
   party, even when their own properties were subjected to these
   depredations, while the friends of France and the Revolution were vexed
   and most confused about it.

   It follows then that a generous policy would produce quite opposite
   effects-it would acquire for France the merit that is her due; it would
   discourage the hopes of her adversaries, and furnish the friends of
   humanity and liberty with the means of acting against the intrigues of
   England, and cement the Union, and contribute toward the true interests of
   the two Republics.

   So sublime and generous a manner of acting, which would not cost anything
   to France, would cement in a stronger way the ties between the two
   Republics. The effect of such an event, would confound and annihilate in
   an irrevocable manner all the partisans for the British in America.

   There are nineteen-twentieths of our nation attached through inclination
   and gratitude to France, and the small number who seek uselessly all sorts
   of pretexts to magnify these small occasions of complaint which might have
   subsisted previously will find itself reduced to silence, or have to join
   their expressions of gratitude to ours.

   The results of this event cannot be doubted, though not reckoned on: All
   the American hearts will be French, and England will be afflicted.

   AN AMERICAN.
