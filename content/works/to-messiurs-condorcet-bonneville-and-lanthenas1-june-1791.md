   To Messiurs Condorcet, Bonneville, and Lanthenas1  June, 1791.

   PARIS,

   GENTLEMEN :

   I have been informed by M. Duchatelet that it is the purpose of certain
   persons to begin the publication of a work entitled Le Republicain.

   Being the citizen of a land that recognizes no majesty but that of the
   people, no government except that of its own representatives, and no
   sovereignty except that of the laws, I tender you my services in helping
   forward the success of those principles which honor a nation and
   contribute to the advancement of the entire world; and I tender them not
   only because my country is bound to yours by the ties of friendship and
   gratitude, but because I venerate the moral and political character of
   those who have taken part in the present enterprise, and feel proud of
   being their associate. Unfortunately all my productions have been composed
   in English, and can be of slight advantage to the cause, except through
   the medium of translation, so that, I suppose, the services I would render
   can never be commensurate with my desires. Moreover, I shall have to spend
   a portion of this summer in England and Ireland.

   The public are generally aware that I subscribe the words COMMON SENSE to
   whatever I publish, and, therefore, I shall use this pen-name in my
   contributions to your work, so that no one may commit the error of
   attributing to me productions in which I have had no share. At the same
   time, I shall try to render my opinions on the political situation so
   self-evident that their tendency cannot be mistaken. If such definiteness
   of expression be always desirable, it is especially necessary in the
   present circumstance, because we are confronting a situation concerning
   which there should be no possibility of misunderstanding our ideas. For
   this reason the title of your publication gives me much satisfaction. The
   words "The Republican" imply that it is solely concerned about the
   Res-publica, namely, the interests of the state, and that includes all the
   ideas we should entertain of government in general.

   The very word "Monarchy" signifies, in its primary meaning, the despotic
   rule of one individual, though that individual be a madman, a tyrant, or a
   hypocrite; kings and courtiers have, indeed, succeeded in giving it a
   gentler meaning but, for all that, the very term is in itself an insult to
   a people, for it is susceptible of no other significance than that which I
   have attached to it. In this relation, then, France is not a monarchy, and
   to style it so is to insult her. The abject servitude which is the
   concomitant of monarchical government no more exists in France now than it
   does in America, and therefore she should regard it as a thing to be
   scorned.

   One of the absurd notions which the dishonesty or the ignorance of  the
   supporters of monarchy have scattered through the world is that, while the
   republican form of government may be suited to a small country, the
   monarchical is the only one that harmonizes with a large one. But this
   opinion, though by the agencies of courts it has been spread broadcast
   through monarchical countries, is in accordance neither with principle nor
   with experience.

   No government can be considered to have completely fulfilled its functions
   if it is not thoroughly acquainted with all the varied interests and all
   the different parts of the nation. For this reason it might be said that
   monarchy is adapted rather to a small country in which the monarch may
   easily become familiar with the affairs of the entire population. On the
   other hand, how can a single individual become familiar with the affairs
   of an extensive territory embracing a multiplicity of diverse interests?
   His helpless ignorance of matters that affect the people must necessarily
   lead to the establishment of a tyrannical form of government. As evidence
   of the truth of this proposition, we have only to point to Spain, Russia,
   Germany, Turkey and the whole of Asia. That I may live to see the freedom
   of these lands is my ardent desire.

   In fact, the only system of government that can insure anything like
   adequate attention to every portion of an extended territory is the
   government that has its source in popular representation.

   Such representation is the most potent and vigorous organ of the opinion
   of a nation. It acts so powerfully on the minds of citizens that they
   approve of it even without knowing why. Every part of France, no matter
   how far away it may be from its center, is aware that that center
   constitutes France, and that in its center it has its integral being. This
   is the feeling of the citizen, however remote may be his abode: he knows
   that his rights are protected, and, if he is a soldier, he is assured that
   he is not enslaved by a tyrant, but that he is the citizen of a free
   nation, and, therefore, bound to defend it.

   It is true that certain countries, such as Holland, Berne, Genoa, Venice,
   etc., call themselves Republics; but these countries do not merit such a
   designation. All the principles upon which they are founded are in direct
   contradiction to every republican sentiment, and they are really in a
   condition of absolute servitude to an aristocracy.

   During the early period of a revolution mistakes are likely enough to be
   committed-mistakes in principle or in practise; or perhaps, mistakes both
   in principle and practise. When men are in the early stage of freedom,
   they are not all sufficiently instructed to be able to inform one an-
   other mutally of their several opinions, and so they become the victims of
   a sort of timidity that hinders them from reaching at a single bound that
   elevation which they have the right to attain. We have witnessed symptoms
   of this imperfection at the beginning of the present Revolution.
   Fortunately, they were manifested before the Constitution was fully
   established, so that whatever defects were apparent could be corrected.

   Hereditary succession is never founded on right; consequently, it has no
   real existence. To sanction such a fallacy is to sanction the fallacy of
   the right of certain individuals, either now born or about to be born, to
   the possession of human beings as their property! It is to declare that
   our posterity is to be classed with the animal creation, destitute alike
   of will and of right! Such a conception debases human nature and should
   forever be effaced from the soul of that humanity which it dishonors.

   Nay, so opposed to the rights of man is hereditary succession that even if
   we, instead of our descendants, should at some future period return to
   life, we should not then have the right to abdicate those rights which
   would be our own peculiar possession. On what argument, therefore, can we
   base our claim to rob of their rights children who will one day become men
   ? How is it we are unable to see the wrong we inflict upon our posterity
   when we attempt to prolong the rule o-L- those infamous despots the
   continuance of whose vices, and of whose vices alone, we can surely
   foretell?

   Only when the French Constitution conforms to the Declaration of Rights
   can France be justly entitled to be called a civic empire; because then
   only will its government be the empire of laws based upon the grand
   republican principles of Elective Representation and the Rights of Man. On
   the other hand, Monarchy and Hereditary succession are totally
   inconsistent with the very fundamental principles of constitutional
   government.

   I venture to think that the preceding opinions will show you that I am a
   sound Republican. Indeed, my conviction of the stability of these
   principles is so firm that I look forward to their triumph in France as
   well as in America. The pride of human nature will emphasize their truth,
   contribute to their success and inspire mankind with a feeling of shame at
   the thought of the very existence of Monarchy.

   I remain, Messieurs, with great respect, Your friend

   THOMAS PAINE.
