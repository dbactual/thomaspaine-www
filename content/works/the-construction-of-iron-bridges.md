Title: The Construction of Iron Bridges
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:53 EDT 2014

   As bridges and the method of constructing them are becoming objects of
   great importance throughout the United States, and as there are at this
   time proposals for a bridge over the Delaware, and also a bridge beginning
   to be erected over the Schuylkill at Philadelphia, I present the public
   with some account of the construction of iron bridges.

   The following memoir on that subject written last winter at the Federal
   City, was intended to be presented to Congress. But as the session would
   necessarily be short, and as several of its members would be replaced by
   new elections at the ensuing session, it was judged better to let it lie
   over. In the meantime, on account of the bridges now in contemplation, or
   begun, I give the memoir the opportunity of appearing before the public,
   and the persons concerned in those works.

   N.B.-The two models mentioned in this memoir will, I expect, arrive at
   Philadelphia by the next packet from the Federal City and will remain for
   some time in Mr. Peale's museum.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   June, 1803.

   BORDENTOWN,

   To THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES

   I have deposited in the office of the Secretary of State, and under the
   care of the Patent Office, two models of iron bridges; the one in paste-
   board, the other cast in metal. As they will show by inspection the manner
   of constructing iron bridges, I shall not take up the time of Congress
   with a description of them.

   My intention in presenting this memoir to Congress is to put the country
   in possession of the means and of the right of making use of the
   construction freely; as I do not intend to take any patent right for it.

   As America abounds in rivers that interrupt the land communication, and as
   by violence of floods and the breaking tap of the ice in the spring, the
   bridges depending for support from the bottom of the river are frequently
   carried away, I turned my attention, after the Revolutionary War was over,
   to find a method of constructing an arch that might, without rendering the
   height inconvenient or the ascent difficult, extend at once from shore to
   shore, over rivers of three, four or five hundred feet and probably more.

   The principle I took to begin with and work upon was that the small
   segment of a large circle was preferable to the great segment of a small
   circle. The appearance of such arches, and the manner of forming and
   putting the parts together, admit of many varieties, but the principle
   will be the same in all. The bridge architects that I conversed with in
   England denied the principle, but it was generally supported by
   mathematicians, and experiment has now established the fact.

   In 1786, I made three models, partly at Philadelphia, but mostly at
   Bordentown in the State of New Jersey. One model was in wood, one in cast
   iron, and one in wrought iron connected with blocks of wood, representing
   cast iron blocks, but all on the same principle, that of the small segment
   of a large circle.

   I took the last mentioned one with me to France in 1787 and presented it
   to the Academy of Sciences at Paris for their opinion of it. The Academy
   appointed a committee of three of their own body-Mons. Le Roy, the Abbe
   Bossou, and Mons. Borda. The first was an acquaintance of Dr. Franklin,
   and of Mr. Jefferson, then minister at Paris. The two others were
   celebrated as mathematicians. I presented it as a model for a bridge of a
   single arch of four hundred feet span over the river Schuylkill at
   Philadelphia. The committee brought in a report which the Academy
   adopted-that an arch on the principle and construction of the model, in
   their opinion, might be extended four hundred feet, the extent proposed.

   In September of the same year, I sent the model to Sir Joseph Banks,
   president of the Royal Society in England, and soon after went there
   myself.

   In order to ascertain the truth of the principle on a larger scale than
   could be shown by a portable model five or six feet in length, I went to
   the iron-foundry of Messrs. Walker, at Rotherham, County of Yorkshire, in
   England, and had a complete rib of 90 feet span, and 5 feet of height from
   the chord line to the center of the arch, manufactured and erected. It was
   a segment of a circle of 410 feet diameter; and until this was done no
   experiment on a circle of such an extensive diameter had ever been made in
   architecture, or the practicability of it supposed.

   The rib was erected between a wall of a furnace belonging to the ironworks
   and the gable end of a brick building, which served as butments. The
   weight of iron in the rib was three tons, and we loaded it with double its
   weight in pig-iron. I wrote to Mr. Jefferson who was then at Paris, an
   account of this experiment, and also to Sir Joseph Banks in London, who in
   his answer to me says-"I look for many other bold improvements from your
   countrymen, the Americans, who think with vigor, and are not fettered with
   the trammels of science before they are capable of exerting their mental
   faculties to advantage."

   On the success of this experiment, I entered into an agreement with the
   iron-founders at Rotherham to cast and manufacture a complete bridge, to
   be composed of five ribs of 210 feet span, and 5 feet of height from the
   chord line, being a segment of a circle 610 feet diameter, and sent it to
   London to be erected as a specimen for establishing a manufactory of iron
   bridges to be sent to any part of the world.

   The bridge was erected at the village of Paddington, near London, but
   being in a plain field, where no advantage could be taken of butments
   without the expense of building them, as in the former case, it served
   only as a specimen of the practicability of a manufactory of iron bridges.
   It was brought by sea, packed in the hold of a vessel, from the place
   where it was made; and after standing a year was taken down without injury
   to any of its parts, and might be erected anywhere else.

   At this time my bridge operations became suspended. Mr. Edmund Burke
   published his attack on the French Revolution and the system of
   representative government, and in defense of government by hereditary
   succession, a thing which is in its nature an absurdity, because it is
   impossible to make wisdom hereditary; and therefore, so far as wisdom is
   necessary in a government, it must be looked for where it can be found,
   sometimes in one family, sometimes in another. History informs us that the
   son of Solomon was a fool. He lost ten tribes out of twelve (2 Chron. ch.
   x). There are those in later times who lost thirteen.

   The publication of this work by Mr. Burke, absurd in its principles and
   outrageous in its manner, drew me, as I have said, from my bridge
   operations, and my time became employed in defending a system then
   established and operating in America, and which I wished to see peaceably
   adopted in Europe. I therefore ceased my work on the bridge to employ
   myself on the more necessary work, "Rights of Man," in answer to Mr.
   Burke.

   In 1792, a convention was elected in France for the express purpose of
   forming a Constitution on the authority of the people, as had been done in
   America, of which convention I was elected a member. I was at this time in
   England and knew nothing of my being elected till the arrival of the
   person who was sent officially to inform me of it.

   During my residence in France, which was from 1792 to 1802, an iron bridge
   of 236 feet span, and 34 of height from the chord line, was erected over
   the river Wear near the town of Sunderland, in the County of Durham,
   England. It was done chiefly at the expense of the two members of
   Parliament for that county, Milbanke and Burdon.

   It happened that a very intimate friend of mine, Sir Robert Smyth (who was
   also an acquaintance of Mr. Monroe, the American Minister, and since of
   Mr. Livingston), was then at Paris. He had been a colleague in Parliament
   with Milbanke, and supposing that the persons who constructed the iron
   bridge at Sunderland had made free with my model, which was at the
   iron-works where the Sunderland bridge was cast, he wrote to Milbanke on
   the subject, and the following is that gentleman's answer.

   "With respect to the iron bridge over the river Wear at Sunderland, it
   certainly is a work well deserving admiration, both for its structure and
   utility, and I have good grounds for saying that the first idea was
   suggested by Mr. Paine's bridge exhibited at Paddington. What difference
   there may be in some part of the structure, or in the proportion of
   wrought and cast iron, I cannot pretend to say, Burdon having undertaken
   to build the bridge, in consequence of his having taken upon himself
   whatever the expense might be beyond between three and four thousand
   pounds sterling, subscribed by myself and some other gentlemen.

   "But whatever the mechanism might be, it did not supersede the necessity
   of a center." (It is the technical term, meaning the boards and numbers
   which form the arch upon which the permanent materials are laid; when a
   bridge is finished the workmen say they are ready to strike center, that
   is to take down the scaffolding.-Author) (The writer has here confounded a
   center with a scaffolding.) "Which center (continues the writer) was
   esteemed a very ingenious piece of workmanship, and taken from a plan
   sketched out by Mr. Nash, an architect of great merit, who had been
   consulted in the outset of the business when a bridge of stone was in
   contemplation. "With respect therefore to any gratuity to Mr. Paine,
   though ever so desirous of rewarding the labors of an ingenious man, I do
   not feel how, under the circumstances already described, I have it in my
   power, having had nothing to do with the bridge after the payment of my
   subscription, Mr. Burdon then becoming accountable for the whole. But if
   you can point out any mode according to which it would be in my power to
   be instrumental in procuring him any compensation for the advantages the
   public may have derived from his ingenious model, from which certainly the
   outline of the bridge at Sunderland was taken, be assured it will afford
   me very great satisfaction. (The original is in my possession.-Author.)

   "RA. MILBANKE."

   The year before I left France, the Government of that country had it in
   contemplation to erect an iron bridge over the river Seine, at Paris. As
   all edifices of public construction came under the cognizance of the
   Minister of the Interior (and as their plan was to erect a bridge of five
   iron arches of 100 feet span each, instead of passing the river with a
   single arch, and which was going backward in practise, instead of forward,
   as there was already an iron arch of 230 feet in existence) I wrote the
   Minister of the Interior, the citizen Chaptal, a memoir on the
   construction of iron bridges. The following is his answer:

   "The Minister of the Interior to the citizen Thomas Paine,-I have
   received, citizen, the observations that you have been so good as to
   address to me upon the construction of iron bridges. They will be of the
   greatest utility to us when the new kind of construction goes to be
   executed for the first time. With pleasure, I assure you, citizen, that
   you have rights of more than one kind to the thankfulness of nations, and
   I give you, cordially, the particular expression of my esteem.

   "-CHAPTAL." (The original, in French, is in my possession.-Author.)

   A short time before I left France, a person came to me from London with
   plans and drawings for an iron bridge of one arch over the river Thames at
   London, of 600 feet span, and 60 feet of height from the chord line. The
   subject was then before a committee of the House of Commons, but I know
   not the proceedings thereon.

   As this new construction of an arch for bridges, and the principles on
   which it is founded, originated in America, as the documents I have
   produced sufficiently prove, and is becoming an object of importance to
   the world, and to no part of it more than to our own country, on account
   of its numerous rivers, and as no experiment has been made in America to
   bring it into practise further than on the model I have executed myself
   and at my own expense, I beg leave to submit a proposal to Congress on the
   subject, which is:

   To erect an experiment rib of about 400 feet span, to be the segment of a
   circle of at least 1,000 feet diameter, and to let it remain exposed to
   public view, so that the method of constructing such arches may be
   generally known.

   It is an advantage peculiar to the construction of iron bridges that the
   success of an arch of a given extent and height can be ascertained without
   being at the expense of building the bridge; which is, by the method I
   propose, that of erecting an experiment rib on the ground where advantage
   can be taken of two hills for butments.

   I began in this manner with the rib of 90 feet span and 5 feet of height,
   being a segment of a circle of 410 feet diameter. The undertakers of the
   Sunderland bridge began in the same manner. They contracted with the
   iron-founder for a single rib, and, finding it to answer, had five more
   manufactured like it and erected into a bridge consisting of six ribs, the
   experiment rib being one.

   But the Sunderland bridge does not carry the principle much further into
   practise than had been done by the rib of 90 feet span and 5 feet in
   height, being, as before said, a segment of a circle of 410 feet diameter;
   the Sunderland bridge being 206 feet span and 34 feet of height, gives the
   diameter of the circle of which it is a segment to be 444 feet, within a
   few inches, which is but a larger segment of a circle 30 feet more
   diameter.

   The construction of those bridges does not come within the line of any
   established practise of business. The stone architect can derive but
   little from the theory of practise of his art that enters into his
   construction of an iron bridge; and the iron-founder, though he may be
   expert in moulding and casting the parts, when the models are given him,
   would be at a loss to proportion them, unless he was acquainted with all
   the lines and properties belonging to a circle.

   If it should appear to Congress that the construction of iron bridges will
   be of utility to the country, and they should direct that an experiment
   rib be made for that purpose, I will furnish the proportions for the
   several parts of the work and give my attendance to superintend the
   erection of it.

   But, in any case, I have to request that this memoir may be put on the
   journals of Congress, as an evidence hereafter that this new method of
   constructing bridges originated in America.
