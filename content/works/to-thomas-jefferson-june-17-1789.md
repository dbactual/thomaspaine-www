   Dear Sir

   I received your last to the 21st May. I am just now informed of Msrs.
   Parker and Cutting setting off tomorrow morn for Paris by whom this
   will be delivered to you &mdash; Nothing new is showing here &mdash; The 
   trial of Hastings, and the Examination of evidence before the house of 
   Commons into the Slave Trade still continue. I wrote Sir Joseph Banks an 
   account of my Experiment Arch &mdash; In his answer
   he informs me of its being read before the Royal Society who expressed
   "great satisfaction at the Communication." &mdash; "I expect," says Sir 
   Joseph, "many improvements from your Countrymen who think with vigor, and 
   are in a great measure free from those shackles of Theory which are imposed 
   on the minds of our people before they are capable of exerting their mental
   facilities to advantage." &mdash; Inthe close of his letter he says: "We have
   lost poor Ledyard &mdash; he had agreed with certain Moors to conduct him to
   Sennar &mdash; The time for their departure was arrived when he found himself
   Ill, and took a large dose of Emetic Tartar, burst a blood vessel in the
   operation which carried him off in three days. We sincerely lament his
   loss, as the papers we have received from him are full of those emanations
   of spirit, which taught you to construct a Bridge without any reference to
   the means used by your predecessors in that art." I have wrote to the Walkers 
   and proposed to them to manufacture me a
   complete Bridge and erect it in London and afterwards put it up to Sale. 
   &mdash; I do this by way of bringing forward a Bridge over the Thames which
   appears to me the most advantageous of all objects for, if only a fifth
   of the persons, at a half penny each pass over a new Bridge as now pass
   over the old ones the tolls will pay 25 per cent besides what will arise
   from carriage and horses &mdash; Mrs. Williams tells me that her letters from
   America mention Dr. Franklin as being exceedingly Ill &mdash; If you go to 
   America this year I hope you will advise Congress not to send
   any Minister to this Country &mdash; It would be all money thrown away 
   &mdash; the greater distance America keeps at the better &mdash;

   I shall be glad you would give me a line when you set off for America so
   that I can write to you before your departure &mdash;  I have been to see the 
   Cotton Mills &mdash; the Potteries &mdash; the Steel furnaces making
   tin plate manufacture &mdash; white lead manufactur &mdash; all those things 
   might be easily carried on in America &mdash; I saw a few days ago part of 
   a handbill of what was called a geometrical wheelbarrow &mdash; but cannot 
   find where it is to be seen &mdash; The Idea is one of those that needed only 
   to be thought of &mdash; for
   it is very easy to conceive that if a wheelbarrow &mdash; as it is called, be
   driven round a piece of land &mdash; a sheet of Paper may be placed in it so 
   as to receive by the tracings of a Pencil, regulated by a little mechanism 
   &mdash; the figure and content of the land &mdash; and that neither 
   Theodolite nor chain are necessary &mdash;
   
   I wrote this at Mr. Parker Lodgings &mdash; 
   
   your affectionate friend and Obedient Humble Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
