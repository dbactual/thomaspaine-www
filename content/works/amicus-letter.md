   Mr. Aitkin,

   Although the present times are not favourable to plans of domestic
   utility, yet from the Continental union and wisdom on one side, and the
   distracted councils and disjointed orders and operations on the other, we
   may reasonably look forward to a period of happy conclusion. I presume I
   shall not be judged premature in furnishing the public through your
   Magazine, with some hints towards a plan for raising a fund for the
   purpose of portioning off young married people, with a reasonable
   sufficiency to begin the world with, who would otherwise have nothing, and
   that with very little expense to their parents, - and likewise for raising
   another fund for the purpose of supporting us in our old age, which, when
   the numberless vicissitudes of life are duly considered, and how
   frequently the pleasing prospects of today, are clouded with the
   misfortunes to-morrow, such a plan cannot fail of being considered as a
   necessary and valuable appendage to our present circumstances.

   I believe the plan for portioning off young married people is entirely
   new, and if effected, would greatly tend to the improvement of America, by
   enabling them to settle on small plantations, or to occupy new, and at
   present uncultivated lands, or establish themselves in manufacturers.

   Many funds have been raised in England for the support of old age, most of
   which have failed, because, in order to lure subscribers, they propose
   making a larger dividend to the incumbent members, then the fund could
   possibly support; neither did any of these societies ever published their
   calculations, on which only, if justly done, the probability of the fund
   being able to support itself could be grounded; but appear to have made
   their proposals at a venture. What I intend laying before the public is, a
   series of calculations, with explanations fitted to the meanest capacity,
   shewing the average probability which every person has to depend on, and
   the benefits he may justly expect therefrom.

   Amicus
