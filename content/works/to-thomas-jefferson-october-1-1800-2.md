   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Dear Sir

   I wrote to you from Havre by the ship Dublin Packet in the year 1797. It
   was then my intention to return to America, but there were so many British
   frigates cruising in sight of the port, and which after a few days knew
   that I was at Havre waiting to go to America, that I did not think it 
   to trust myself to their discretion, and the more so, as I had no
   confidence in the Capt. of the Dublin Packet (Clay). 
   
   I mentioned to you
   in that letter, which I believe you received through the hands of Col.
   Burr, that I was glad, since you were not President, (paragraph crossed out)

   The Commissioners Ellsworth and Co. have been here about eight
   months, and three more useless mortals never came upon public business.
   Their presence appears to me to have been rather an injury than a benefit.
   They set themselves up for a faction as soon as they arrived. I was then
   in Belgia. - 
   
   Upon my return to Paris I learned they had made a point of not
   returning the visits of Mr. Skipwith and Barlow, because, they said, they
   had not the confidence of the executive. Every known republican was
   treated in the same manner. I learned from Mr. Miller of Philadelphia, who had 
   occasion to see them
   upon business, that they did not intend to return my visit, if I made one.
   This, I supposed, was intended I should know, that I might not make
   one. It had the contrary effect. I went to see Mr. Ellsworth. I told him I
   did not come to see him as a Commissioner, nor to congratulate him upon
   his mission; that I came to see him because I had formerly known him in
   Congress. - I mean not, said I, to press you with any questions or to engage 
   you in any conversation upon the business you are come upon, but I will
   nevertheless candidly say that I know not what expectations the Government
   or the people of America may have of your mission, or what expectations
   you may have yourselves, but I believe you will find you can do but
   little. The treaty with England lies at the threshold of all your
   business - The American Government never did two more foolish things than
   when it signed that Treaty, and recalled Mr. Monroe, who was the only man
   could do them any service. - Mr. Ellsworth put on the dull gravity of a judge, 
   and was silent. - I added,
   you may, perhaps, make a treaty, like that you have made with England, which
   is a surrender of the rights of the American flag; for the principle that
   neutral ships make neutral property must be general or not at all. - I then
   changed the subject, for I had all the talk to myself upon this topic and
   inquired after Samuel Adams (I asked nothing about John), Mr. Jefferson,
   Mr. Monroe and others of my friends, and the melancholy case of the yellow
   fever, of which he gave me as circumstantial an account as if he had been
   summing up a case to a Jury. Here my visit ended, and had Mr. Ellsworth been 
   as cunning as a Statesman,
   or as wise as a Judge, he would have returned my visit that he might
   appear insensible of the intention of mine.

   I now come to the affairs of this Country and of Europe. You will, I
   suppose, have heard before this arrives to you, of the battle of Maringo in
   Italy where the Austrians were defeated &mdash; of the armistice in consequence
   thereof, and the surrender of Milan, Genoa,&c. to the french &mdash; of the
   successes of the french Army in Germany &mdash; and the extension of the 
   armistice in that quarter &mdash; of the preliminaries of Peace signed at 
   Paris &mdash; Of the refusal of the Emperor to ratify these preliminaries 
   &mdash; of the
   breaking of the Armistice by the french Government in consequence of that
   refusal &mdash; Of the *gallant* expedition of the Emperor to put himself at 
   the head of his Army &mdash; of his pompous arrival there &mdash; Of his having 
   made his will &mdash; Of prayers being put in all his Churches for the 
   preservation of the life of this Hero &mdash; Of General Moreau announcing to 
   him, immediately on his
   arrival at the army that hostilities would commence the day after the
   next at sunrise unless he signed the treaty or gave security that he would
   sign within 45 days &mdash; Of his surrendering up three of the principal
   Keys of Germany, Ulm, Philipsburg, and Ingolstadt, as security that he
   would sign them. This is the state things are now in, at the time of writing 
   this letter;
   but it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign the
   preliminaries was motivated upon a note from the king of England to be
   admitted to the Congress for negotiating Peace, which was consented to by
   the french upon the condition of an Armistice at Sea, which England,
   before knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused.
   From all which it appears to me, judging from Circumstances, that the
   Emperor is now so completely in the hands of the french, that he has no
   way of getting out but by a peace. The Congress for the peace is  to be
   held at Luneville, a town in france. Since the affair of Rastad the
   french Commissioners will not trust themselves with the Emperor's
   territory.

   I now come to domestic Affairs. I know not what the Commissioners have
   done but from a paper I enclose to you, which appears to have some
   authority, it is not much. The paper as you will perceive is considerably
   prior to this letter. I know that the Commissioners before this piece
   appeared intended setting off. It is therefore probable that what they
   have done is conformable to what this paper mentions - which certainly will
   not atone for the expence their mission has incurred, neither are they by
   all the accounts I hear of them men fitted for the business.

   But independently of these matters there appears to be a state of
   circumstances rising, which if it goes on, will render all partial
   treaties unnecessary. In the first place, I doubt if any peace will be made
   with England; and in the second place, I should not wonder to see a
   coalition formed against her, to compel her to abandon her insolence on
   the Seas. This brings me to speak of the manuscripts I sent you.

   The piece No. 1, without any title, was written in consequence of a
   question put to me by Bonaparte. As he supposed I knew England and English
   Politics he sent a person to me to ask, that in case of negotiating a
   Peace with Austria, whether it would be proper to include England. This
   was when Count St. Julian was in Paris, on the part of the Emperor
   negotiating the preliminaries: - which as I have before said the Emperor
   refused to sign on the pretense of admitting England.

   The piece No. 2, entitled, *On the Jacobinism of the English at Sea*, was
   written when the English made their insolent and impolitic expedition to
   Denmark, and is also an auxiliary to the politics of No. 1. - I shewed it to
   a friend who had it translated into french and printed in the form of a
   Pamphlet, and distributed gratis among the foreign ministers, and persons
   in the government. It was immediately copied into several of the french
   Journals, and into the official Paper, the Moniteur. It appeared in this
   paper one day before the last despatch arrived from Egypt; which agreed
   perfectly with what I had said respecting Egypt. It hit the two cases of
   Denmark and Egypt in the exact proper moment.

   The piece No. 3 entitled *Compact Maritime* is the sequel of No. 2
   digested in form. It is translating at the time I write this letter, and I
   am to have a meeting with the Senator Garat upon the subject. The pieces
   2 & 3 go off in manuscript to England by a confidential person where
   they will be published.

   By all the news we get from the North there appears to be something
   meditating against England. It is now given for certain that Paul has
   embargoed all the English vessels and English property in Russia, till some
   principle be established for protecting the Rights of Neutral Nations, and
   securing the liberty of the Seas. The preparations in Denmark continue 
   notwithstanding the Convention that
   she has been made with England, which leaves the question with respect to the
   right set up by England to stop and search neutral Vessels, undecided. I
   send you the paragraphs upon the subject.

   The tumults are great in all parts of England on account of the excessive
   price of corn and bread, which has risen since the harvest. I attribute it
   more to the abundant encrease of paper, and the non-circulation of Cash,
   than to any other Cause. People in Trade can push the paper off as fast as
   they receive it, as they did by continental money in America; but as
   farmers have not this opportunity, they endeavour to secure themselves by
   going considerably in advance.

   I have now given you all the great articles of Intelligence for I trouble
   not myself with little ones, and consequently not with the Commissioners,
   nor any thing they are about, nor with John Adams otherwise than to wish
   him safe home, and a better and wiser man in his place.

   In the present state of circumstances and the prospects arising from them,
   it may be proper for America to consider, whether it is worth her while to
   enter into any treaty at this moment, or to wait the event of those
   Circumstances, which if they go on will render partial treaties useless by
   deranging them. But if, in the mean time, she enters into any treaty it ought 
   to be with a condition to the following purpose Reserving to herself the right 
   of joining in an Association of Nations for the protection of the rights of
   Neutral Commerce and the security of the liberty of the Seas.

   The pieces 2, 3, may go to the press. They will make a small pamphlet and
   the printers are welcome to put my name to it. It is best it should be
   put. From thence they will get into the newspapers. I know that the
   faction of John Adams abuses me pretty heartily. They are welcome. It does
   not disturb me, and they lose their labour; and in return for it I am doing
   America more service, as a neutral nation, than their expensive
   Commissioners can do and she has that service from me for nothing. The
   piece No. 1 is only for your own amusement and that of your friends &mdash; 
   I come now to speak confidentially to you on a private subject. 
   
   When Mr.
   Ellsworth and Davies return to America, Murray will return to Holland, and
   in that case, there will be nobody in Paris but Mr. Skipwith that has been
   in the habit of transacting business with the french Government since the
   revolution began. He is on a good standing with them, and if the chance of the 
   day should
   place you in the presidency you cannot do better than appoint him for any
   purpose you may have occasion for in France. He is an honest man and will
   do his Country Justice, and that with Civility and good manners to the
   government he is commissioned to act with; a faculty which that Northern
   Bear Timothy Pickering wanted, and which the Bear of that Bear, John
   Adams, never possessed.

   I know not much of Mr. Murray, otherwise than of his unfriendliness to
   every American who is not of his faction, but I am sure that Joel Barlow
   is a much fitter man to be in Holland than Mr. Murray. It is upon the
   fitness of the man to the place that I speak for I have not communicated
   a thought upon the subject to Barlow, neither does he know, at the time of
   my writing this (for he is at Havre), that I have intention to do it.

   I will now, by way of relief, amuse you with some account of the progress
   of Iron Bridges. 
   
   The french revolution and Mr. Burke's attack upon it,
   drew me off from any pontifical Works. Since my coming from England in
   92, an Iron Bridge of a single arch 236 feet span, versed sine 34 feet,
   has been cast at the Iron Works of the Walkers where my Model was, and
   erected over the river Waer at Sunderland in the County of Durham in
   England. The two members in Parliament for the County Mr. Bourdon and Mr.
   Milbank were the principal subscribers; but the direction was committed
   to Mr. Bourdon. A very sincere friend of mine, Sir Robt Smyth who lives
   in france, and whom Mr. Monroe well knows, supposing they had taken their 
   plan from my Mode, wrote to Mr. Milbank upon the subject. Mr.
   Milbank answered the letter, which answer I have by me and I give you
   word for word the part concerning the Bridge. "With respect to the Bridge
   over the river Waer at Sunderland it certainly is a Work well deserving
   admiration both for its structure and utility, and I have good grounds for
   saying that the first Idea was taken from Mr. Paine's bridge exhibited at
   Paddington. But with respect to any compensation to Mr. Paine, however
   desirous of rewarding the labours of an ingenious man, Mr. Paine, I see not how 
   it is in my power, having had nothing to do with the bridge after the payment 
   of my subscription, Mr. Bourdon being accountable for the whole. But if you
   can point out any mode by which I can be instrumental in procuring for Mr.
   Paine Compensation for the advantages which the public may have derived
   from his ingenious model, from which certainly the outlines of the Bridge
   at Sunderland was taken, be assured it will afford me great satisfaction."

   I have now made two other models. One in pasteboard five feet span, and
   five inches of height from the cord. It is in the opinion of every person
   who has seen it one of the most beautiful objects the eye can behold. I
   then cast a model in metal following the construction of that in
   paste-board and of the same dimensions. The whole was executed in my own
   Chamber. It is far superior in strength, elegance, and readiness in
   execution to the model I made in America, and which you saw in Paris. I
   shall bring those models with me when I come home, which will be as soon
   as I can pass the Seas in safety from the piratical John Bulls.

   I suppose you have seen, or have heard of the Bishop of Llandaff's Answer
   to my second part of The Age of Reason. As soon as I got  copy of it I
   began a third part, which served also as an answer to the Bishop; but as
   soon as the clerical Society for Promoting *Christian Knowledge* knew of my
   intention to answer the Bishop, they prosecuted, as a Society, the printer
   of the first and second parts, to prevent that answer appearing.
   No other reason than this can be assigned for their prosecuting at the
   time they did, because the first part had been in circulation above three
   years and the second part more than one, and they prosecuted immediately
   on knowing that I was taking up their Champion.
   The bishop's Answer, like Mr. Burke's attack on the french revolution,
   served me as a background to bring forward other subjects upon with more
   advantage than if the background was not there. This is the motive that
   induced me to answer him, otherwise I should have gone on without taking
   any notice of him. I have made and am still making additions to the
   manuscript and shall continue to do so till an opportunity arrive for
   publishing it.

   If any American frigate should come to france and the direction of it
   fall to you I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of
   returning. The abscess under which I suffered almost two years is entirely
   healed of itself, and I enjoy exceeding good health. This is the first of
   October, and Mr. Skipwith has just called to tell me the Commissioners set
   off for Havre tomorrow. This will go by the frigate but not with the
   knowledge of the Commissers. - Remember me with much affection to my
   friends and accept the same to yourself.
