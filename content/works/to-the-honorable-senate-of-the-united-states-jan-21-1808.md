   From the records of the American State Papers, No. 189, 10th Congress, First Session.

   *To the honorable the Senate of the United States:*  New York, *January* 21, 1808.

   THE purport of this address is to state a claim I feel myself entitled to
   make on the United States, leaving it to their representatives in Congress
   to decide on its worth and its merits. The case is as follows:

   Towards the latter end of the year 1780, the continental money had become
   so depreciated, a paper dollar not being more than a cent, that it seemed
   next to impossible to continue the war.

   As the United States were then in alliance with France, it became
   necessary to make France acquainted with our real situation. I therefore
   drew up a letter to Count de Vergennes, stating undisguisedly the true
   case; and concluding with the request, whether France could not, either as
   a subsidy or a loan, supply the United States with a million sterling, and
   continue that supply, annually, during the war.

   I showed the letter to Mr. Marbois, secretary to the French minister. His
   remark upon it was, that a million sent out of the nation exhausted it
   more than ten millions spent in it. I then showed it to Mr. Ralph Isard,
   member of Congress for South Carolina. He borrowed the letter of me, and
   said, "We will endeavor to do something about it in Congress."

   Accordingly Congress appointed Colonel John Laurens, then aid to
   General Washington, to go to France and make representation of our
   situation, for the purpose of obtaining assistance. Colonel Laurens wished
   to decline the mission, and that Congress would appoint Colonel Hamilton;
   which Congress did not choose to do.

   Colonel Laurens then came to state the case to me. He said he was enough acquainted 
   with the military difficulties of the army, but that he was not enough acquainted 
   with political affairs, nor with the resources of the
   country, to undertake the mission; "but," said he, "if you will go with
   me, I will accept it;" which I agreed to do, and did do.

   We sailed from Boston in the Alliance frigate, Captain Barry, the
   beginning of February, 1781, and arrived at L'Orient the beginning of
   March. The aid obtained from France was six millions livres as a present,
   and ten millions as a loan, borrowed in Holland, on the security of
   France. We sailed from Brest in the French Resolve frigate the 1st of
   June, and arrived at Boston the 25th of August, bringing with us two
   millions and a half of livres in silver, and convoying a ship and a brig
   laden with clothing and military stores. The money was transported in
   sixteen ox teams to the National Bank at Philadelphia, which enabled the
   army to move to Yorktown to attack, in conjunction with the French army
   under Rochambeau, the British army under Cornwallis. As I never had a cent
   for this service, I feel myself entitled, as the country is now in a state
   of prosperity, to state the case to Congress.

   As to my political works, beginning with the pamphlet *Common Sense*,
   published the beginning of January, 1776, which awakened America to a
   declaration of independence, as the President and Vice President both
   know, as they were works done from principle, I cannot dishonor that
   principle by asking any reward for them. The country has been benefited by
   them, and I make myself happy in the knowledge of it. It is, however,
   proper to me to add, that the mere independence of America, were it to
   have been followed by a system of Government, modelled after the corrupt
   system of the English Government, it would not have interested me with the
   unabated ardor it did. It was to bring forward and establish the
   representative system of Government, as the work itself will show, that
   was the leading principle with me in writing that work, and all my other
   works during the progress of the revolution. And I followed the same
   principle in writing the *Rights of Man*, in England.

   There is a resolve of the old Congress, while they sat at New York, of a
   grant of three thousand dollars to me. The resolve is put in handsome
   language, but it has relation to a matter which it does not express.
   Elbridge Gerry was chairman of the committee who brought in the resolve.
   If Congress should judge proper to refer this memorial to a committee, I
   will inform that committee of the particulars of it.

   I have also to state to Congress, that the authority of the old Congress
   was become so reduced towards the latter end of the war, as to be unable
   to hold the States together. Congress could do no more than recommend, of
   which the States frequently took no notice; and, when they did, it was
   never uniformly.

   After the failure of the five per cent. duty recommended by Congress, to
   pay the interest of a loan to be borrowed in Holland, I wrote to
   Chancellor Livingston, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Robert
   Morris, Minister of Finance, and proposed a method for getting over the
   whole difficulty at once; which was, by adding a continental Legislature
   to Congress, who should be empowered to make laws for the Union, instead
   of recommending them; so the method proposed me their full approbation. I
   held myself in reserve, to take the subject up whenever a direct occasion
   occurred.

   In a conversation afterwards with Governor Clinton, of New York, now Vice
   President, it was judged that, for the purpose of going fully into the
   subject, and to prevent any misconstruction of my motive or object, it
   would be best that I received nothing from Congress, but leave it to the
   States individually to make me what acknowledgment they pleased.

   The State of New York made me a present of a farm, which, since my return
   to America, I have found it necessary to sell; and the State of
   Pennsylvania voted me five hundred pounds, their currency. But none of the
   States to the east of New York, or the south of Philadelphia, ever made
   the least acknowledgment. They had received benefits from me, which they
   accepted, and there the matter ended. This story will not tell well in
   history. All the civilized world know I have been of great service to
   the United States, and have generously given away talent that would have
   made me a fortune.

   I much question if an instance is to be found in ancient or modern times
   of a man who had no personal interest in the cause he took up, that of
   independence and the establishment of a representative system of
   Government, and who sought neither place nor office after it was
   established, that persevered in the same undeviating principles as I have
   done, for more than thirty years, and that in spite of difficulties,
   dangers, and inconveniences, of which I have had my share.

   THOMAS PAINE.
