Title: Letters on the Bank
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:51 EDT 2014

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   After the publication of his Dissertations Paine did not abandon the
   controversy raging over the repeal of the Bank of North America's charter.
   He continued to defend the bank in a series of letters in the Pennsylvania
   Packet, the Pennsylvania Gazette and the Freeman's Journal. These letters
   have never been reprinted and do not appear in any previous collection of
   Paine's writings.

   The first letter in this series appeared in the Pennsylvania Packet of
   March 25, 1786, and the last one was published in the Pennsylvania Gazette
   of March 7, 1787. During this period the bank's charter had been repealed
   and restored. Paine's letters were extremely important in rallying popular
   support for the restoration of the bank's charter, and he was subjected to
   bitter attacks from the anti-bank forces in the legislature. He was
   attacked in the press as a drunkard and turn-coat. "I cannot conceive,"
   wrote "Atticus," "in the wide extent of creation, a being more deserving
   of our abhorrence and contempt, than a writer, who having formerly
   vindicated the principles of freedom, abandons them to abet the cause of a
   faction, who exerts the little talent which Heaven has allotted him, . . .
   to vilify measures which it is his duty to respect, and . . . [devote] his
   pen to the ruin of his country." The city mechanics, however, supported
   Paine, and in the autumn elections of 1786 indicated by their vote that
   they agreed with him on the issues involved in the controversy.

   AS I have always considered the bank as one of the best institutions that
   could be devised to promote the commerce and agriculture of the country,
   and recover it from the ruined condition in which the war had left both
   the farmer and the merchant, as well as the most effectual means to banish
   usury and establish credit among the citizens, I have always been a friend
   to it.

   When the opposition to the bank first began last year, there were many
   people inclined to think that it arose from no other motives than those of
   party prejudice and ignorance of the business: But there were others who
   hesitated not to say that a large majority of the late assembly had formed
   their plan for carrying their funding bill, and were speculating on the
   purchase and sale of certificates, and determined to destroy every thing
   which they supposed might not unite with that scheme.

   Which of these suppositions are best founded, or whether both of them are
   not too true, will be sufficiently known before the next election. One
   thing, however, is already proved, which is, that the late assembly have
   created one of the greatest fields of speculation ever known in
   Pennsylvania. The funding acts produce an interest, in many cases, of
   between twenty and thirty per cent, and the country is loaded with taxes
   to pay the speculations. In the mean time the opposition to the bank is
   kept up to amuse the people.

                                                                                                              
   Common Sense

   The bubble of Silas Deane and the bubble of the opposition to the bank
   have several circumstances in them that are alike. As an honest friend to
   the public I set myself to detect the one, and with the same motives of
   sincerity I shall pursue the other.

   The leaders of this opposition having undertaken what they did not
   understand, are endeavoring to strengthen themselves by making it a party
   matter between the constitutionalists and the republicans. They find
   themselves losing ground and now seek to shelter their misconduct and
   mismanagement under this resource.

   The bank as a national question has nothing to do with party. As a means
   of increasing the commerce and promoting the agriculture and prosperity of
   the country it is supported by numbers of the constitutionalists as well
   as republicans.

   It would be a very poor excuse for a representative of Bucks or Berks, or
   any of the counties whose property depends on the ready sale and
   exportation of its produce, to tell their constituents, that though the
   attack on the bank last year had operated to reduce the market for their
   produce, and retard the exportation of it, yet the loss must be submitted
   to, for it was a party matter. A man in office may live by his party, or a
   man in power, and fond of displaying it, may make some sacrifices to
   preserve it. But what is this to the farmer; he must live by his labor and
   the produce of his farm.

   Nothing is more certain than that if the bank was destroyed, the market
   for country produce would be monopolized by a few monied men, who would
   command the price as they pleased. And it is a matter much to the honor of
   some merchants in the city who by their fortunes could engross the trade
   to themselves that they support the bank as a public benefit to the
   commerce of the state.

   Were there no other use of a bank than that of affording a safe convenient
   place where people who have spare cash by them which they do not
   immediately want, may lodge it until they had occasion for it; this alone,
   I say, were there no other use in a bank is a material advantage to the
   community, because it keeps the money in use and circulation that would
   otherwise be locked up. There are in this city nearly six hundred people
   who constantly send their spare cash to the bank in this manner. They
   receive no interest for it, and in the mean time the country has the use
   of the money. Take away the bank and this money returns into the chests
   and coffers of its owners, where it lies locked up in death and darkness,
   and is, in the mean time, of no more use to the community than if it was
   in the mine.

   If there are any who suppose that I have engaged myself in this business
   merely on account of the bank, I wish they would state their reasons. I am
   ready to satisfy any man either publicly or privately on this, or any
   other circumstance relating to my conduct therein. I know how and where
   the opposition began, and the manner it has been conducted, even to the
   writing of the report of the committee of the late house of assembly. And
   the persons concerned in this opposition have for ten years past known me
   too well even to believe that I am governed by self-interested motives.

   TO THE PRINTERS

   AS the Press ought to be as sacred to liberty, as the privilege of Speech
   is to the Members of Assembly in debate, you will please to insert the
   following in your paper.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   In the Pennsylvania Packet of last Tuesday is a publication signed Common
   Sense which begins in the following manner.

   "The bubble of Silas Deane. and the bubble of the opposition against the
   bank, have several circumstances in them that are alike. As an honest
   friend to the public I set myself to detect the one, and with the same
   motives of sincerity I shall pursue the other."

   "The concluding paragraph in that publication is, If there are any who
   suppose that I have engaged myself in this business merely on account of
   the bank, I wish them to state their reasons. I am ready to satisfy any
   man either publicly or privately on this or any other circumstance
   relating to my conduct therein. I know how and where the opposition began,
   and the manner it has been conducted, even to the writing the report of
   the committee of the late house of assembly. And the persons concerned in
   this opposition, have for ten years past known me too well to believe that
   I am governed by self-interested motives."

   Here is a fair and open opportunity given to any man either to charge me
   with it, or inform himself respecting it.

   The pamphlet on the affair of the bank, under the signature of Common
   Sense, was published on the first day of the meeting of the present
   setting of the house, nearly six weeks ago. If the arguments used in that
   pamphlet in support of a public bank as beneficial to the state could have
   been refuted, or the facts or matters stated therein contradicted, it
   ought to have been done. It is a public question, a subject that concerns
   the interest of every man in the state, and any lights that could have
   been thrown thereon, either by those who were for, or those who were
   against such an institution, would have been acceptable to the public. No
   subject of debate that has been agitated before the legislature of
   Pennsylvania ever drew together such crowded audiences as attended the
   house during the four days the debate lasted. And it was very easy to
   discover from the countenance of the people that the debate has
   illuminated their minds, though it has been lost upon the opposing party
   in the house.

   But instead of answering the pamphlet, or instead of making the charge I
   publicly invited, or obtaining the information I offered, the member from
   Fayette county, who can be at no loss to know my suspicions of his
   integrity on this business, which I shall in my subsequent publication lay
   before the public, gets up in his place, impertinently introduces the
   pamphlet to the house, and calls the writer of it "an unprincipled author
   whose pen is let out for hire."

   Respect to the representative body of a free people, however wrong some of
   them, in my opinion, may be on this subject; the decency proper to be
   observed in such a place, and on such an occasion, and the manners due to
   a numerous and respectable audience, restrained me to silence, or I should
   have been justified in rising and contradicting him by the most plain and
   unequivocal word the English language can express.

   I appeal to the honor, the feelings of any person, let his opinion
   respecting the institution of a bank be what it may, whether there can be
   a greater influence of meanness, and depravity, or a greater prostitution
   of legislative privilege, than, for a man, sheltered under the sanctioned
   authority of a representative, and speaking in his place, to make use of
   that opportunity to abuse private characters: for though the name was not
   mentioned, the person alluded to was sufficiently understood.

   A perfect unlimited freedom of speech must be allowed in legislative
   debates; and that liberty includes every other the tongue is capable of,
   if a man is base enough to use it. Had he charged an individual with
   breaking open a house, or robbing on the highway, or had he declared that
   the circumstances of any private man were on the point of bankruptcy and
   thereby ruined his credit and his family, he might be called to order by
   the speaker or any of the members, but this is all. The privilege of the
   house protects him. There is no law can lay hold of him. This, then, being
   the situation of a member, restrained by no checks but the sense of honor
   and the force of principle, none who esteemed his own character would
   exceed the bounds.

   From conduct like this the opposition to the bank can derive no
   reputation; and the suspicion will naturally spread, that where such
   methods are used something bad must be at the bottom. But if Mr. Smilie
   chose to make such an attack, why did he not do it in the first day's
   debate, I could then have answered him on the last day: but be reserved
   himself till just before the vote was taken, and when it could not be
   contradicted, for reasons too obvious to be mentioned.

   In the debate of Friday evening a member from the city mentioned one of
   the causes of the opposition to the bank, and connected it with an
   allusion which, probably related to Mr. Smilie. As I am acquainted with
   the circumstance, I shall lay it before the public, and they will then
   judge of Mr. Smilie's political honesty in this business, and have a
   better insight into the opposition than they have yet had.

   Last year the vote for taking away the charter of the bank was upwards of
   50 to 12. The vote last Saturday for restoring it with an additional
   clause, was 30 to 39. Mr. Clymer, though strongly in support of the bank,
   voted against it in this question, because he was against the additional
   clause. If his vote had been for it, the numbers would have stood 31 to
   38-consequently four more votes would have re-established the bank, and
   restored its full usefulness again to the country.

   In the present house are twenty-four members who were members of the late
   house, and who voted for taking away the charter; yet with this number of
   clogged votes, the question for re-establishing had nearly been carried.
   On the question for restoring the charter, without the additional clause,
   the majority against it was thirteen.

   By this state of the business in the house, and the great change of
   sentiment that is spreading through both the city and country, it is
   visible, that the people are recovering from the delusion and bubble of
   the last year.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA,



   TO THE PRINTERS

   AS the Press ought to be as Sacred to Liberty, as the privilege of a
   Speech is to the Members of Assembly in debate, you will please to insert
   the following in your paper.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   As I intend to begin and continue a series of publications on the
   usefulness of a public bank, to the trade, commerce and agriculture of the
   state, and as it is proper that a man's motives on public affairs should
   be known, I shall, in this publication endeavor, as concisely as I can, to
   bring into one view, such parts of my own conduct, as relates thereto. In
   doing this, certain parts of Mr. Smilie's conduct will necessarily make
   their appearance.

   As to the improper use which that member made of the privilege of speech
   in the house, of styling me an unprincipled author, he is welcome to it,
   and I give him my consent to repeat it as often as he pleases and where
   ever he chooses. I shall make a few remarks on this part of the subject,
   and then proceed to more material matter.

   While those members of the house who style themselves constitutionalists,
   as well as those who act as the leaders of that party, appeared to me to
   pursue right measures and proceed on right principles, they had what
   assistance it was in my power to give them.

   In the winter of 1778, a very strong opposition was made to the form of
   the constitution. As the constitution was then on an experiment, and the
   enemy in full force in the country, the opposition was injudicious. To
   this may be added another reason, which is, that the constitution, by
   having only a single house, was the best calculated form of civil
   government that could be devised for carrying on the war; because the
   simplicity of its structure admitted of dispatch, and dispensed with
   deliberation. But that which was then its blessing is now its curse.
   Things are done too rashly.

   As the opposition was becoming formidable, the persons then in office and
   power, or those who hoped or expected to be so, became somewhat seriously
   alarmed, and they applied very solicitously to me to help them. I did so,
   and the service was gratis; and so has been every other which they have
   had from me, from that day to the present hour; and they might still have
   had it, and on the same terms, had they purchased just and wise measures
   of government, and an honest system of politics. The service here alluded
   to is in a number of publications, entitled "A Serious Address to the
   People of Pennsylvania on the Present State of Their Affairs." Before the
   appearance of those publications, the newspapers were filled with pieces
   in opposition to the constitution; none appeared afterwards, it is
   therefore reasonable to conclude they had some effect. The
   constitutionalists got full possession of the government-they enjoyed
   their places and offices, and here the matter ended.

   When the war ceased, there were these of all parties, as well of this
   state as of other states, who thought it unreasonable, as well as
   dishonorable to the country, to suffer the service of a man who had been a
   volunteer in its cause for so many years, to pass off unacknowledged. The
   principal mover in this business was the commander in chief. The state of
   New York (being the place where the war ended) made the first step, and I
   mention it with a just sense of the generosity and gentility of their
   conduct.

   The last time General Washington was in Philadelphia, he engaged the late
   president, Mr. Dickinson, to move the same matter in this state, which
   engagement that gentleman very honorably and friendly fulfilled, and the
   supreme executive council unanimously concurred with him in recommending
   it to the consideration of the assembly.

   In this manner it came before the house, and at a time when those who
   style themselves constitutionalists (for they are not so in principle)
   were by a turn of elections reinstated in the power they had lost for two
   or three years before. I mean the late house of assembly.

   The matter respecting myself, on the recommendation of council, was before
   them at the very time they began their attack on the bank. It is therefore
   inconsistent, and even absurd, to suppose, that I could have any
   self-interested motives in opposing that attack, when they were on the
   point of deciding on a matter that immediately concerned my interest.
   Therefore my opposition to their politics at that critical time must be
   placed to other motives.

   The recommendation of council respecting me was, in one of the stages of
   it, brought on in the house, a short time before the attack on the bank
   broke out. I shall place Mr. Smilie's declaration in the house at that
   time, against what he said in the same house a few days ago, and the event
   will probably be, that people will believe neither what he then said, nor
   what he now says.

   Mr. Smilie then said, that "excepting General Washington, there was not a
   more disinterested patriot in America, than Mr. Paine." He now says, that
   "Mr. Paine is an unprincipled author, whose pen is let out for hire." Thus
   you see my trumpeter can blow all sorts of tunes. And I am very sorry that
   such a high encomium as he has given me should stand upon such loose
   authority as himself. But the "balance" in this case is, that what I
   suffer by his praise, is made up to me by his censure. (Mr. Smilie, who
   loves to talk about what he does not understand, is always exposing his
   want of knowledge, in haranguing about the balance of trade.-Author.)

   But to return to my point. As it could not be interest that induced me to
   oppose their attack on the bank at the time here alluded to, it is proper
   I should declare what the motive was.

   It was friendship to them. I saw very clearly they were going to destroy
   themselves by a rash, mad, unjust, tyrannical proceeding, and that they
   might not, I endeavored in the most pressing and friendly manner to
   remonstrate with them, to point out the consequence, and caution them
   against it.

   For this purpose, and with this design, I had repeated conversations with
   Mr. Smilie on the subject, as he appeared to make himself one of the most
   violent in the business. Not a soul belonging to the bank, or that had the
   least connection with it, or any other person, knew what I was then doing.
   For as it was from motives of friendship that I then spoke, I kept it to
   myself, and it went no further than from me to them.

   But Mr. Smilie is not the only one that I urged the same matters to. And I
   will here take the liberty (I hope I shall be pardoned in it) in
   mentioning the name of a gentlemen whose friendship and acquaintance I
   have always esteemed and wish to preserve-Colonel J. D. Smith.

   As I knew he had a general acquaintance with the persons concerned in the
   opposition, there was scarcely a day passed, while the matter was before
   the house last year, that I did not go to him, and in the strongest and
   sincerest terms I could use, endeavor to impress him with the danger his
   friends were running into. That they would ruin the whole interest of the
   constitutional party by it. That the proceeding was so arbitrary and
   unjust, so despotic and tyrannical, that no body of men who went on such
   grounds, could support themselves or be supported in it. That the event
   would not only be the total overthrow of the constitutional party in the
   state, among whom were many that I sincerely esteemed, but that it would
   overset the constitution: because it could not fail to create an
   apprehension which would grow into a belief, that a single legislature, by
   having it in its power to act with such instant rashness, and without
   restrained, was a form of government that might be as dangerous to
   liberty, as a single person.

   I expressed many of the same arguments to the then speaker, and it always
   appeared to me, from their manner of conversation on the subject, that
   there was something in the conduct and principles of the late house they
   did not approve, and strongly implied a wish that the matter had not been
   so rashly gone into.

   But it is the fate of friendship, that where it is not accepted it is sure
   to offend. I do not apply this to the two last mentioned gentlemen; I
   should be unjust to them if I did. The matter, however, respecting myself
   in the house, went heavily on, after my sentiments on the attack on the
   bank were known. The acknowledgment the house made to me was not equal to
   the money I had relinquished to the state, exclusive of the service. The
   acknowledgment was connected with a proposition to renew the matter at a
   future day, and in this manner it now stands before the present house,
   there being at this time a committee on the business. Therefore I can have
   no interest in acting as I now do in opposition to a majority of the
   house, and it must be equally as clear that I am acting disinterestedly.

   As the bill for abolishing the charter of the bank lay over till the last
   meeting of the late house, there was a probability the house would see its
   error, and reject what it had so rashly began. I therefore published
   nothing on the subject, during that time.

   On my return to Philadelphia, in the winter, I found that experience had,
   in some measure, effected what reason and the right of things could not.
   Many who had been clamorous against the bank began to question the
   legality of the measure, and to apprehend ill effects from it.

   The stockholders of the bank resolved to commence a suit; but the wound
   given to the faith of the state, together with the arbitrary principles on
   which the late house acted, were matters that concerned the people. They
   therefore brought their complaints before the present house from different
   parts of the state by memorial. Those memorials exhibit a charge of'
   delinquency against the late house and call on the present house to
   redress the injury by undoing an just act. This is the ground the
   memorials go on. But it happens in this case that the matter of right is
   interwoven with a matter of interest. All the settled parts of
   Pennsylvania which carry on trade with the city and draw from thence
   returns of money by the sale of their produce, felt their interest hurt as
   well as their rights invaded. The attack on the bank operated as an attack
   on their pockets as well as on their principles. The city felt the same
   injury, and therefore they joined from a twofold motive in a demand of
   justice.

   All this while the originating moving cause of the opposition to the bank
   remained a secret. Clamor filled the place of reason and argument.
   Influence, monopoly and danger, were held out to the people, and the
   mis-led multitude caught the bait.

   But notwithstanding all this cry of influence, this clamor of monopoly, it
   is influence and monopoly that have produced the attack on the bank. There
   are certain men in Philadelphia, whether friends or otherwise to the
   revolution matters not, they are monied men. These men view a public bank
   as standing in the way of their private interest. Their wealth is not of
   so much value to them as it would be if the bank was demolished, and
   therefore they say down with the bank. To accomplish this point, so
   agreeable to their wishes, and advantageous to their wealth, they have
   been working through the ignorance of the late house in matters of
   commerce, and the nature of banks, and on the prejudices of others as
   leaders of that party, to demolish the bank. It might be error in the
   former, but it is willful mischief in the latter; and as mischief is not
   lessened by the apology of error, nor increased by the criminality of
   design, therefore those who sacrificed to prejudice, are, as to matters of
   public trust, alike the objects of public reprobation.

   As one of the gentlemen who oppose the bank, as standing in the way of his
   private interest, has not made any great secret of his reasons, there can
   be no impropriety in making him and his reasons public.

   The gentleman I here mean is Mr. George Emlen. However worthy or
   respectable a man may be in private life, yet when he from self-interested
   motives privately opposes a public institution, or get[s] others to do it,
   because it puts the credit of an honest, industrious tradesman, just and
   punctual in his dealings, though not so rich as himself, on a level with
   his wealth, it is but fair those reasons should be public.

   The reasons Mr. Emlen has given for not signing the memorial lately
   presented to the house, and for his opposition to the bank, are, "that
   while the bank stands a monied man has no chance-that his money is not so
   valuable to him now as it would be then-that if the bank was demolished he
   could buy country produce for exportation cheaper." If these are just
   reasons for demolishing the bank, let it be demolished- if they are
   popular reasons let them have their effect. But at any rate let them be
   known that they may be judged of.

   These being Mr. Emlen's reasons for demolishing the bank, can any thing be
   more inconsistent and suspicious than that the members of assembly who
   have, all this while, been holding out to their country constituents that
   the bank is injurious to the former and the middling sort of people, can,
   I say, any thing be more inconsistent than to see men of such contrary
   declarations acting in concert to destroy the bank.

   This is the age of negotiation, compromise and coalition: but here is one
   that for wisdom or folly, exceeds them all. The coalition of lord North
   and Charles Fox is innocent childishness compared to this. How powerfully
   must Mr. Emlen's reason operate on the worthy loquacious member from
   Fayette county. How strong must be his conviction that the bank is
   injurious to the farmer, when Mr. Emlen assures him that were it not for
   the bank he could buy the farmer's produce for less money.

   When I found that this coalition had taken place, and that Mr. Emlen was
   the friend of Mr. Smilie, and Mr. Smilie of Mr. Emlen, and that the
   entertainment of his table was open to the opposing members to the bank, I
   could not but be struck at the strangeness of the connection, and that Mr.
   Smilie might not be ignorant that he was made a dupe of, or subject
   himself to worse suspicions, I informed a friend of his, Dr. Hutchinson,
   of it, and desired him to communicate Mr. Emlen's reasons for opposing the
   bank to Mr. Smilie. This is at least three weeks ago.

   Having now stated to the public the circumstance I alluded to in my former
   piece, I shall reserve the continuation of the subject to a future paper.

   COMMON SENSE.

   April 6.

   PHILADELPHIA,

   TO THE PUBLIC

   NUMBER III

   AS the debates and proceedings of the Assembly, on the report of the
   committee (to whom were referred the memorials of a very large and
   respectable number of freemen, in divers parts of the state, in behalf of
   the injured honor of the fame, and complaining of the im- proper,
   unconstitutional and faithless conduct of the late house, in their
   proceedings respecting the Bank of North-America) are advertised to be
   published in a pamphlet, by the person who usually attends the Assembly
   for the purpose of taking down debates, and as those debates, if correctly
   taken, will serve to set forth the unjust and arbitrary proceedings of the
   late house, and to show the exceeding usefulness of a public Bank to the
   landed and commercial interest of the state, I shall, (after the present
   number) discontinue the remarks I have to offer on the subject, until
   those debates are in the hands of the public.

   Having thus mentioned my intention, I shall confine my present remarks to
   such matters as more immediately relate to those debates. Whoever will
   take a review of them, cannot but perceive that the speakers in opposition
   to the Bank are those, who from their remote situation feel themselves
   very little, if at all, interested in the prosperity of the more settled
   and improved parts of the state. Their ideas of government, agriculture
   and commerce, are drawn from the limited to their own frontier
   habitations; and their politics seem calculated to suit their particular
   situations, at the expense and detriment of the rest. By attempting this,
   they injure themselves and the event in this instance, as in all others of
   narrow and contracted politics, will turn out to their own disadvantage.

   If those persons could not perceive that a Bank was beneficial to the
   landed interest, it must be-either because they have yet no produce to
   sell or export, or because they have no commercial intercourse with the
   market where the Bank is established at. But even in this case their
   policy is ill calculated, and badly applied.

   The time will come, when they will have produce for sale and exportation,
   and consequently will then want a market and a ready means of turning it
   into cash; and whether that produce is brought to Philadelphia market or
   goes to Baltimore, the consequences to themselves will be nearly the same.
   The quick intercourse of commercial intelligence that passes between the
   two markets of Philadelphia and Baltimore, immediately operates to
   regulate the price of the one by the other; and whenever it fails here,
   from whatever cause it may be, it falls there.

   There are two stages or degrees into which the landed interest in
   Pennsylvania progressively divides itself, viz. settlers and farmers.
   And as a man's ideas are generally produced in him by his present
   situation and condition, it will naturally follow, that if you investigate
   his situation you will get into the channel his thoughts run in, and find
   out their source, direction and extent.

   The frontier parts of the state are called settlements, and the improved
   parts farms. A settler is not yet a farmer; he is only in the way of being
   so. In the stage of a settler, his thoughts are engrossed and taken up in
   making a settlement. If he can raise produce enough for the support of his
   family, it is the utmost of his present hopes. He has none to bring to
   market, or to sell, and therefore commerce appears nothing to him; and he
   cries out, that a Bank is of no use. But the case is, he is not yet in a
   condition to participate of its usefulness. When he is, he will think
   otherwise.

   But the improved parts of the state, having undergone the hardship and
   labor attending the making new settlements, are now become farms, and the
   occupiers of them are farmers. The others, as I have before observed, are
   yet but settlements, and many of them only laid out to be such, and the
   occupiers of them are settlers. Therefore, when a back county member says
   that the Bank is of no use to the farmer, he means the settler, who has
   yet no produce to sell, and knows nothing about the matter. Of the
   twenty-eight who voted for restoring the Charter of the Bank, twenty-five
   are country members. Those gentle- men, by residing in the improved parts
   of the state, from whence the staple commodities of the country are
   brought, are certainly better judges of the usefulness of a public bank,
   than those, who, from their distance, have no commercial intercourse with
   the market, and never visit it but when they are sent as representatives.

   As to paper money, which so frequently occurs in the speeches of the back
   county members, I will, in a few words, explain their motive and meaning
   for it.

   Not one of them will take it when it is made; but all of them will borrow
   it of the public, under the name of a Loan Office, let the value of it be
   little or much, and trust the payment to the chance of depreciation, or
   other future events. According to the ideas which some of them threw out,
   they would continue striking an additional quantity every year, till the
   value of the first emissions was so reduced, that they would strike
   themselves out of debt, at the expence of all the settled and improved
   parts of the state.

   But however paper money may suit a borrower, it is unprofitable, if not
   ruinous in the end, to every other person. The farmer will not take it for
   produce, and he is right in refusing it. The money he takes for his year's
   produce must last him the year round; and the experience he has had of the
   instability of paper money has sufficiently instructed him, that it is not
   worth a farmer's while to exchange the solid grain and produce of a farm
   for the paper of an Assembly, whose politics are changing with every new
   election, and who are here one year and gone another.

   But the persons against whose immediate interest paper money operates the
   strongest, are the manufacturers and mechanics.

   We all know there is no part of the continent where manufacturers and
   mechanics flourish so much as in the New-England states. They were famed
   for them before the war, and are so at this day.

   But the circumstance which gave spring to those arts among them was, their
   banishing the use of paper money, which they effectually did many years
   before the war. The consequence was, that all the hard money that their
   export trade brought in remained among them; and as none of it could be
   spared to send abroad to purchase foreign manufactures necessity obliged
   them to manufacture for themselves. It was by banishing paper money, that
   they established the arts, and retained among them a sufficiency of hard
   money.

   I know some of the persons who put themselves at the head of the
   opposition against the Bank last year said (for I was present), that they
   wished there was not a hard dollar in the country.

   If this wish were, or could be, carried in practice there could then be no
   other than paper money; the consequence of which would be, that all the
   hard money which the exports of the country brought in would be
   immediately sent out again, to purchase foreign manufactures and trinkets.

   We are frequently passing acts to encourage manufactures, but the most
   effectual encouragement would be, to banish the practice of paper money.
   We have the experience of the New England states before us, which is
   preferable' to all the reasoning that can be offered on the subject.

   An independent country and paper money is a ridiculous connection. It is a
   weak, flimsy, idle system of government. We have as good a chance as other
   nations to share in the current coin of the world, gold and silver, did
   those who exercise the power of government understand it.

   ON THE ADVANTAGES OF A PUBLIC BANK

   IF the experience of other countries on the science of Banking be a matter
   worth attending to, there can be no hesitation in pronouncing in favor of
   a well-regulated public Bank. I shall therefore introduce this part of the
   subject by taking a concise view of the conduct of other nations on this
   subject.

   In countries under a despotic government there are no public banks,
   because in such countries those who have wealth think it safer to conceal
   than to expose it. Public banks, therefore, are the offspring only of free
   countries, or of those which approach the nearest thereto; and in
   proportion as the people share in the government, in nearly that
   proportion do public banks prosper and are encouraged.

   In Holland and in England, where the people, by their right of election
   and representation, participate in the government of the country, more
   than in any other of the same importance in Europe, that participation
   protects their wealth, and they trust it to a bank with safety: by this
   means all the money of the country is brought into use: whereas in
   countries where the people have no share in the government, and live under
   the continual apprehension of the power exercised over them, the rich
   secret their money, or keep it locked up for their own use only; and the
   bulk of the people, from the want of its free and confidential
   circulation, are kept poor.

   It is not so much the quantity of wealth, as the quantity that circulates,
   that constitutes the monied riches of a country. If we may credit history
   and reports, there is more money in some countries, where the generality
   of the people are wretched and poor, than in some others that are esteemed
   rich; but in the one it is hoarded, and in the other it is dispersed by
   circulation and gives briskness and vigor to industry and improvement. One
   of the best methods to increase wealth in a country is to increase the
   circulation of it, by inducing every part of it to be brought forth, and
   constantly moving. A pound hoarded for a year, and then paid away, pays
   but one debt of twenty shillings in that time; but the same pound paid
   away every day, does the same service three hundred and sixty five times
   over.

   Public banks, therefore, being the offspring of free countries, and of
   free countries only, or of such as approach the nearest thereto, and are
   not instituted in despotic governments, it is no reputation to the
   political principles of those persons, who endeavored to suppress the
   institution of a public bank in this state.

   The superior advantages of a public bank in a country to those of private
   ones are very evident. Private banks can only be set up by men of large
   fortune, and therefore they would be a monopoly in the hands of a very
   few: but in a public bank divided into shares, the monopolizing system is
   destroyed, and the business thrown open and any man in any part of the
   country may be a banker by being a stockholder.

   In a private bank, the true condition of it can be known only to the
   proprietor. This being the case, he may extend his credit too much beyond
   his capital. He may trade or speculate with the money deposited in his
   hands, and either by ill fortune in his projects, or fraudulent designs,
   may break. But in a public bank, there are too many people concerned to
   admit of secrecy; and the business is conducted by established rules,
   which cannot be dispensed with, or departed from. The directors are
   refrained from trading with the capital of the bank, or the money
   deposited there, and therefore the security of a public bank is greater
   than that of a private one. The proprietor likewise of a private bank be
   he ever so substantial will die; and when this happens, his affairs will
   be in the hands of executors, who are not always the best people to settle
   with: But in a public bank this never happens; its affairs never go into
   the hands of executors, because the directorship being filled up by
   election, never dies.

   Had the persons who formed the scheme for opposing the bank been the
   institutors of it, it would then have been held out as one of the finest
   things imaginable. But such is the intoxicating spirit of party, and such
   the operation of envy, that where it cannot do the service that is wanted,
   it endeavors to prevent its being done. But in the instance of opposing
   the institution of the bank, the spirit of party carries something like a
   double face. Those who have been most clamorous against it, however they
   may conduct themselves in other places are nevertheless making use of its
   convenience. If they are now convinced of the usefulness of such an
   institution, they ought to be candid enough to say it.

   One of the clamors against the bank was, that none but persons interested
   in the institution were its advocates and supporters. This is very true,
   if rightly understood, for every man is interested in supporting an
   institution that is of general utility. The stockholders are but a very
   small part of the numerous body of the citizens of the state, who are
   seeking to preserve and retain so useful an institution as a public bank.
   All the countries that are arrived at a degree of opulence sufficient to
   carry on any kind of trade by means of the produce of their lands, are as
   much if not more, interested in the matter than a stockholder. In short,
   every man who has any concern with money matters, and that every one has
   more or less, is in some degree benefited by an institution that serves,
   like the heart to the body, to give circulation through the state.

   Another of the clamors was, that people could not borrow money as before.
   For this they may in a great measure thank their representatives, who by
   the instability of their political conduct, and the levity they have shown
   in making and unmaking of laws, violating faith, and tampering with credit
   and paper money, have made one man afraid to trust another; and this will
   ever be the case while such methods are practiced.

   But the most beneficial system of loaning, for the general interest of the
   country, is by means of a public bank. Loans for short periods serve to
   pay the farmer, the miller, the tradesman, the workman, etc. and hundreds
   are served in the course of a year to one that would be served by loans
   for a long period of time. The former system of loans was excellently
   adapted to the circumstances of the country at that time. It enabled
   people to make farms; but now that the farms are made, the best
   encouragement to the farmer is to provide means to buy and pay, in real
   money, for the produce he has to sell.

   If the money that now compose the capital of the bank could possibly be
   spared by the stockholders, which it cannot, and lent to individuals in
   different parts of the country for a number of years, only a very few
   persons could be served, compared with the numbers served now, and those
   only who had already considerable property to give in security; and the
   first borrowers would exclude all others from the chance of borrowing
   during the time for which they had borrowed themselves. He therefore who
   puts his money in the bank, lends it to a more general good, than if he
   were to trust it to the use of one person only for a number of years.

   I shall conclude this paper with a declaration, that in this place may not
   be improper, which is, That from the first establishment of the bank, to
   the present hour, I have been its friend and advocate; yet I have never
   made the least use of it, or received the least personal service or favor
   from it, by borrowing or discounting notes, or in any other shape or
   manner whatever or of any person concerned with it directly or indirectly.
   I have kept cash at the bank, and the bank is at this time in account to
   me between eight and nine hundred pounds, for money which I brought from
   New York, and deposited there ever since last September, and for which I
   do not receive a single farthing interest. This money the country has had
   the use of, and I think it safer under the care of the bank, until I have
   occasion to call for it, than in my own custody.

   COMMON SENSE.

   ADDRESSED TO THE OPPOSERS OF THE BANK

   ERROR like guilt is unwilling to die. However strong the conviction, or
   clear the detection, it still disdains to yield, and though defeated
   struggles to survive. The opposers to the Bank, finding their cause as
   unpopular as it is unjust, are endeavoring to confound what they cannot
   confuse, and to recover by contrivance what they lost by misconduct.
   Failing in the onset, they seek to embarrass the issue, and escape
   undefeated in the fog of perplexity.

   New devices, as frivolous as they are unjust, are couched under new
   pretenses, and held out to divide or to deceive. A small reinforcement, by
   any means obtained, might serve as a prop to their consequence, or an
   apology to their defeat.

   When men have rashly plunged themselves into a measure, the right or wrong
   of it is soon forgotten. Party knows no impulse but spirit, no prize but
   victory. It is blind to truth, and hardened against conviction. It seeks
   to justify error by perseverance, and denies to its own mind the operation
   of its own judgment. A man under the tyranny of party spirit is the
   greatest slave upon earth, for none but himself can deprive him of the
   freedom of thought.

   The obscure promoters of the opposition to the Bank imagined that their
   consequence would be lessened, and their influence circumscribed by the
   growing circumstances of the country. They hated the means that should
   raise it above themselves, and beheld the Bank as an instrument of public
   prosperity. The lower was the ebb, the easier they would ascend to the
   surface, and the more visible they would appear. Their sphere of
   importance was that of a general poverty, and their hopes depended on its
   duration. "Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven," was the language
   of Lucifer, and the same motives served to instigate the opposition.

   In this plan they were joined by a band of usurers, whose avarice of 50
   and 60 per cent, was consequently opposed by the operation of the Bank,
   which discounted at the legal interest of six per cent. They were further
   supported by the speculators in the funding scheme, who were calculating
   to draw from the public an annual interest of 20 and 30 per cent, and
   encrease the value of the capital in their hands at least one hundred per
   cent. This is a caracature which the public are truly interested in having
   explained. What but this .could bring an assemblyman of the constitutional
   party and an usurer together.

   Unjust measures must be supported by unjust means. No sooner was their
   scheme reprobated by men of integrity and independent principles, but
   invention was put to the rack, and truth to defiance, to weaken the credit
   of those who opposed the injustice of their proceedings. This man was
   bribed and that man was hired, and slander and falsehood, the ministering
   angels of malevolence, had full employment.

   So far as any of their insinuations regard me, I put them to defiance, I
   challenge any man amongst them to come forth and made the assertion. I
   dare them to it; and with all the calm composure of integrity disdain
   their insinuations, and leave them to lick the file and bleed away their
   venom. An insinuation, which a man who makes it does not believe himself,
   is equal to lying. It is the cowardice of lying. It unites the barest part
   of that vice with the meanest of all others. An open liar is a highwayman
   in his profession, but an insinuating liar is a thief sculking in the
   night.

   Could the opposition to the Bank succeed in effecting its downfall, the
   consequence would be their own destruction as a party in the state. The
   attempt has already reduced their numbers and exasperated the country, and
   could they accomplish the end, it would be fatal to them. But they are
   happy in not having discernment enough to foresee the effects of their own
   measures. They persist because they have begun, and shun the prudence that
   would teach them to retreat.

   Had the Bank closed its accounts as the opposition supposed it would at
   the passing of the repealing act, the confusion and distress in this city,
   and the effects that would have followed to the country, would have
   brought vengeance on the heads of the promoters of that measure. The
   quantity of cash that would have been taken away and for ever removed from
   this state, by the stockholders in distant parts, would have brought on a
   famine of money. I know one gentlemen who would have drawn out twenty-four
   thousand dollars, none of which would ever more have returned among us. Is
   there any man except a madman or an idiot, that will say we have too much
   money and want to have less. Can it be for the interest of this state to
   banish the wealth it possesses, at the very time it is complaining of the
   scarcity of cash.

   The leaders of the opposition in this city are chiefly composed of those
   who live by posts and offices under the government, and if there are but
   taxes enough to pay their salaries, the distress would not reach their
   interest.

   The opposition in the House of Assembly is chiefly supported by members
   from whom such an opposition has an indelicate appearance. It has the
   appearance of envy at the prosperity of all the old settled parts of the
   state. The commerce and traffic of the Back Country members and the parts
   they represent goes to Baltimore. From thence are their imports purchased
   and there do their exports go. They come here to legislate and go there to
   trade. In questions of commerce, and by commerce I mean the exports as
   well as the imports of a country, they are neither naturally nor
   politically interested with us, and the delicacy of the case when matters
   of this kind are agitated should have with them a greater weight. What
   advantage persons thus situated can propose to themselves from a
   dissolution of the Bank at Philadelphia is not easy to perceive. The money
   drawn away by the stockholders in distant parts, though removed from this
   state, would not be deposited at Baltimore. It is very possible that a
   branch of the present Bank may extend there, and in this view they are
   defeating their own future interest: If one part of the state is thus to
   go on in opposing the other, no great good can arise to either. The
   principle is ungenerous and the policy injurious, and the more it is
   reflected upon the worse it will appear.

   The cry and bubble, the falsehoods and insinuations that were raised
   against the Bank have sunk and wasted away as groundless clamors always
   will. The politics founded on such contrivances never succeed, and the
   event serves to involve the projectors in disgrace. A very little serious
   thinking was sufficient to convince any man, that the more money could be
   retained in the country the better, and that to break up the Bank and
   banish so large a capital from the state as the stockholders in distant
   parts have deposited with us, never more to return among us; could answer
   no man's purpose who had his living to work for, though it might not
   affect those who live by posts and offices. Would not that politician be
   considered as a madman in England, who should propose to break up the Bank
   in that nation, and send away to Holland and other countries the money
   which those foreigners have deposited with them: and he must be equally as
   vile a politician who proposes the same thing here.

   So far as the part I have taken in the business has gone, it has been
   applied to preserve the money in the country, by supporting the Bank; and
   in this undertaking I am certain of the approbation of every serious
   thinking man who wishes to see the country in prosperous circumstances.

   As for the crazy brained politicians who began and promoted the attack on
   the Bank, I have had experience enough of their abilities for several
   years past to know them sufficiently, and that a country under the
   management of their politics would be a perpetual scene of distraction and
   poverty.

   I did not leave them when they were weak and distressed, but in the height
   of their prosperity, and in full possession of the government. I very
   explicitly and candidly stated to them my reasons for reprobating their
   conduct, and that at a time when themselves know it was against my
   interest to do it; and I very freely gave them my opinion (such as it was)
   that those unjust and despotic proceedings would work their downfall. But
   they were intoxicated with power, government with power, government-mad,
   too blind to foresee the consequence, and too confident to be advised.
   They trusted to the transitory popularity obtained by delusion, and
   supposed that a multitude deceived was never to be convinced.

   But there are certain points in this business, which ought always to be
   kept in view.

   The Bank originated on the inability of the government to carry on the
   war, and at a time when some of its present opposers were on the point of
   abandoning the cause. I speak this because I know it. But so unhappy is
   the spirit of envy, that it can be just to no merit but its own. The
   services which the Bank rendered have been a poison to those little minds,
   that at once receive and hate the good that others perform.

   On the fall of the continental currency a band of usurers arose, and those
   who wanted to borrow paid from thirty to sixty per cent for their loans.
   These men are among the enemies of the Bank.

   On the establishment of the Bank, nearly the whole of its abilities to
   lend were rendered to Congress, and so pressing and necessitous were the
   requisitions of that body, and so devoted was the Bank to the support of
   the public cause, that in more instances than one the Bank ran the risk of
   losing its whole capital. At this time the present opposers of the Bank
   lay snug with what hard money they had in their pockets, and contributed
   none of it to supply the public exigency.

   On the termination of the war, all risk and danger being over, those same
   persons, so quiet then, and so noisy since, formed the scheme of setting
   up another Bank. Not from any public principle or for any public purpose;
   not to expel the enemy, for he was already expelled; but merely with a
   view to make money and profit. They had no hard money, God help them, not
   they, while there was danger of losing it; but when that danger was over,
   they could find hard money for a new bank. To carry this plan, and draw
   new associates to it, they proposed revising the Test-laws, which, as
   their scheme of a new Bank did not succeed, they afterwards voted against.

   Disappointed in their plan of setting up another Bank, they immediately
   struck off on the contrary tack, propagated a report that Banks were
   injurious and dangerous, and brought in a bill to demolish that Bank they
   had attempted to rival. How they should ever expect that men who had
   reputations yet unlost should join or concur with them in such a
   contradictory and unprincipled round of projects, is a proof how little
   they regard reputation themselves. Their conduct is in itself a satire
   upon hypocrisy, and equalled only by the impudence of acting it.

   When the demands of Congress on the Bank ceased with the war, it was then
   enabled to employ its capital in promoting the domestic prosperity of the
   country; and it was fortunate for Pennsylvania that she possessed such a
   resource as the Bank, at the close of a war which had ruined her commerce,
   reduced her farmers, and impoverished her monied men; when she had, as it
   were, the world to begin anew, and when, had it not been for the
   intervention of the Bank, the usurers would have devoured the land.

   The Bank went on, and no complaint was heard against it. Its impartial
   punctuality served to collect and restore the shattered remains of credit,
   and replace the confidence which the war and paper currencies had
   destroyed.

   At this time, without provocation, without cause, and without any motive
   that was wise, just or honorable, the Assembly, unwarranted by their
   constituents, and unjustified by the pretence, commenced an attack upon
   its charter. They fabricated the tales they wished to have believed, and
   set them up for the voice of the people. A few runners out of doors kept
   up the alarm, and the public, unacquainted with the business, and
   unsuspicious of the deception, were trepanned into the lure.

   That they had not the support of the people, is evident from the
   disapprobation which the two succeeding elections show to their conduct.
   They dismissed from their trust the promoters of that measure, and elected
   others, to redress the injustice their predecessors had committed.

   If the inhabitants of the back western parts of the state are not
   benefited by the establishment of a Bank within the state; it is because
   their trade and commerce is carried out of it. They neither increase its
   exports nor consume its imports, nor bear a proportionate share of the
   public burdens. Yet were the state of Maryland, to which place their
   commerce is carried, to emit a paper currency, there are none of those
   persons but would prefer a Pennsylvania bank note at Baltimore, that could
   at any time be changed into hard money, to the paper currency of a state
   of which they are not members. Therefore, instead of opposing the Bank on
   this narrow policy, they would have acted consistently with their interest
   to have supported it, and joined their endeavors to establish a branch of
   it in that state.

   As to paper currencies, when we consider the fluctuating disposition of
   legislatures, the uncertainty of their movements, the probability of the
   division and separation of a state, disputes about the residence of
   government, and numerous other occurrences that may take place in a state,
   there can be no confidence placed in them. They stand on such a contingent
   foundation, on such a changeable connection of circumstances, and subject
   to such a multitude of events, not easy to foresee, and always liable to
   happen, that paper currencies can never be trusted to either as riches or
   as a medium of commerce; because a medium must in the nature of it be
   subject to the least possible fluctuation, or it is not a medium, and
   paper is subject to the greatest fluctuation of all other things, being
   capable of sinking to no value at all, of which this country has
   sufficient experience.

   Pennsylvania being the center of the thirteen states, her situation, with
   the assistance of a Bank, enabled her to carry on a trade upon the produce
   of other states. Through the medium of the Bank, for Bank notes had credit
   in all the states, she imported their productions, exported them again,
   became importers for those states, and gained a profit upon the trade. By
   this means the riches of Pennsylvania were increased, and many industrious
   people furnished with employment. Of this branch was the tobacco trade.

   But matters of this kind form no part of the politics of the opposition.
   It is more agreeable to them to keep the country low and poor, that they
   may govern it the easier, than to see it prosperous, and beyond the reach
   of their influence.

   These are some of the principal outlines in tracing the subject of the
   Bank. As to several little matters that have been started, as well in the
   assembly as out of it, they are not worth wasting the public time upon.

   It is of very little or no consequence to the generality of people, and a
   matter which they do not trouble themselves about, because it does not
   affect them one way or the other, in what manner the stockholders of the
   Bank conduct their private concerns, regulate their elections, and do many
   other domestic matters. Those who best know the business, best know how to
   manage it, and the object with the public is best answered, when that
   business is best performed. Those who place their money there, are the
   properest people to take care of it, and the better it is taken care of,
   the more security there is in the Bank.

   The greater quantity of money which the credit of the Bank can bring into
   the state, the better for the people; for it is not the money collected
   within the state, but the monies drawn to it from distant parts, monies
   which would not be here were it not for the Bank, that forms the principal
   capital of the Bank.

   As to the domestic matters of the Bank, even the opposition is obliged to
   be silent. The business of it has been conducted with unimpeached
   faithfulness and good management. Therefore the best, and only certain
   line to proceed on, in restoring its legal re-establishment, is to keep as
   near is possible to the line of its original charter. Of this we have had
   an experienced security, to which innovations may be dangerous and fatal.
