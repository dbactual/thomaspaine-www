   To William Short  June 22, 1790

   LONDON,

   DEAR SIR:

   The paper No. 1 is the beginning of the letter which I mentioned in the
   few lines which I wrote you by Mr. Hushinson. I now send it because it
   contains some soft reproaches to the M. de la Fayette which I wish him to
   know of.

   But the principal subject of that letter I have thrown into another form
   and it contained in the Paper No. 2. My design in doing this is that it
   may be translated into French and published. It will make a little
   pamphlet such as they sell for three or four Sous in Paris. When it is
   published in French it may be published here as a translation, but you
   will see by the purport of it that it cannot come out here as an English
   production. But I wish you first to take it to the M. de la Fayette and
   closet yourself for half an hour with him and read and talk over the
   contents, and do not forget to tell him at the same time that I have
   appointed you my Minister Plenipo to reproach him for his inattention to
   me for the letters I have written to him, which were merely for his
   service and not for my own.

   I know the character of this Country so well that nothing but carrying a
   high-hand can manage them. Yet they are the greatest Cowards on Earth as
   all Bullies are, if you impress them rightly. Unaccustomed to wars at home
   or on their own coast, they have no idea of a War but at a distance, and
   that they are only to read the accounts of it in the news-paper. Of this
   sort of war they make a mere trade and ever will.

   If the present dispute is in negotiation or is to be negotiated it will be
   of use to impress them with what France and Spain can do for the Ministry
   here have committed themselves so fully that unless more reasons can be
   shown than what the Ministry will like to give out themselves, they will
   be surely afraid to close the business, and on the other hand if they
   intend a war the contents of the enclosed will operate to detain their
   fleets at home, for such will be the fears and clamors of the John Bulls
   that the Coast must be guarded at the risk of all other enterprises, and
   whether their views are to the Baltic, the West Indies or elsewhere the
   same event will follow, that is, the fleet must keep at home. If France
   could now have the combined fleets in the Channel and Paul Jones in the
   North Sea frightened the Bulls' last war, she would know at once how to
   manage this perverse Country.

   As the Bulls never talk but of one thing at a time, the whole talk now is
   Electione[e]ring. When that is over they will talk again about Peace and
   War. I believe the utmost force that this Country could now put to Sea is
   not 20 Ships of the line, and which has no Land Troops on Board worth
   mentioning. She cannot man her fleet but under a great length of time
   because the greatest part of her seamen are abroad. Therefore France and
   Spain gain nothing by delay.

   Last Sunday Evening I was at the Marquis de la Lucerne's and I shall dine
   there on Thursday next. M. le Portier, who is a great Revolutionist and
   who lived in M. Noailles' family when ambassador here and is a great
   Champion for the Marquis de la Fayette, is uneasy for consequences on the
   14th of July. He hears all that passes among the Duke of Luxemburgh who,
   he says, is an outrageous Aristocrat and the rest of that Tribe. The
   Duke's Sons had gone to Falmouth to take the Packet for Lisbon but were
   recalled and returned to London. He tells me they are all set off again,
   he knows not where, and he is afraid they have mischief in their hearts.

   If on consultation it should be concluded to translate and publish the
   enclosed I must desire you to send me some of the publications and also
   the original which I shall publish here as a translation for I have no
   time to make a copy, it being now near five o'clock and it goes off at
   Six. But you must put these under Cover to me and send in M.
   Lucerne'sdispatches. The Porter will take care that they come safe to me.

   The American Papers mention that the Exports of Flour, Grain, Rice, Corn
   last year was 15 Millions of Dollars. The clearances from Philadelphia
   last year was 1258 Free; it never amounted to 800 before the revolution.
   This is great encouragement to promote the principle of Revolution.

   THO . PAINE.
