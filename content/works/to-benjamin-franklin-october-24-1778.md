   To Benjamin Franklin  October 24, 1778

   PHILADELPHIA,

   DEAR HONORED SIR :

   I congratulate you on your accession to the State of Minister
   Plenipotentiary. Could you have lived to fill a particular point in the
   circle of human affairs, it would have been that to which you are now so
   honorably called.

   We rub and drive on, all things considered, beyond what could ever be
   expected, and instead of wondering why some things have not been done
   better, the greater wonder is we have done so well. As I wish to render
   the History of this Revolution as complete as possible I am unwilling to
   begin it too soon, and should be glad to consult you first, because the
   real motives of the British King in commencing the War will form a
   considerable political part. I am sufficiently persuaded myself that they
   wished for a quarrel and intended to annex America to the Crown of England
   as a conquered country. They had no doubt of victory and hoped for what
   they might call a Rebellion, but we have not, on this side the water,
   sufficient proof of this at present. I intend to embellish it with plates
   of heads plans etc. which likewise cannot be perfected here.

   I enjoy thank God a good share of health and hopes and though my situation
   is no ways advantageous, it is nevertheless agreeable. I have the pleasure
   of being respect[ed] and I feel a little of that satisfactory kind of
   pride that tells me I have some right to it. I am not much hurried in the
   Secretary department, and have sufficient leisure for anything else.

   At this time the public expectations run high on the Enemy quitting New
   York, but for what or where is all uncertain, neither do I believe they
   know what to do themselves.

   The Marquis de Fayette returns with the warmest thanks from this country.
   His amiable and benevolent manners have been a living contradiction to the
   narrow spirited declarations of the British Commissioners. He happily
   returns in safety, which, considering the exposures he has gone through,
   is rather to be wondered at.

   A large detachment sailed from N[ew] York destination unknown- probably
   for Boston, but as you will receive later information than this letter can
   convey, anything which I may mention will be of little use.

   I am, with every wish for your happiness, Your obliged and affectionate
   Humble Servant,

   T. PAINE.

   Please present my compliments to your Grandsons.
