   Foner's Introduction:

   The following article appeared originally in the Pennsylvania Journal of
   June 4, 1777, and has never before been reprinted. Ludlow's letter
   appeared in the Journal of May 21, 1777.

   Some of Paine's arguments in the article are rather vague and definitely
   dated, but it is interesting to observe two points he raises. He
   emphasizes, for example, that "a man may be religiously happy without
   modes," thus revealing a trend of thought that he was to develop fully in
   the Age of Reason. Again, he reminds the people that more important than
   the details of this or that clause in a constitution, was "whether we
   should have one of our own forming or of the enemy's. This, to say the
   least, was a realistic approach to the problem.

                                  -----------

   EVERY subject for discussion may be treated two several ways, generally or
   particularly. In a general review exactness is not expected; but when a
   writer undertakes to examine and lay down the parts of his subject
   separately and systematically, the greatest possible degree of exactness
   is necessary, and a failure in this part would be fatal to him.

   The writer of the letter in question has attempted the latter, and in the
   course of his reasonings, says, "the present Constitution is deficient in
   point of perspecuity and method." I am not considering whether he is
   writing for or against the Constitution, but how far he appears to be
   master of "perspecuity and method" himself; as, by that only, we can judge
   of his abilities to reform the errors of others.

   Many pieces, by being distributed into parts of 1, 2, 3, etc. have much
   the appearance of order to the eye, but unless the matter be first justly
   arranged in the mind of the author, and transmitted in the same order into
   writing, his numbers 1, 2, 3 etc. will make no impression on the
   understanding of the reader; and this gentleman, whom I shall be very
   candid with, will, I fear, stand convicted on the same charge he has
   brought against the Constitution.

   He sets out with giving, first, a sort of general description of "a Free
   Government." Secondly, a particular description of the parts thereof; each
   of which he has endeavored to illustrate by a simile; consequently, the
   same correspondence must exist between the similies as between the parts
   which they are supposed to represent: but if there be a want of harmony,
   the fault is, that either the similes are unnatural, the parts defective,
   or both. Thirdly, he proposes to "apply those principles (which ought
   rather to be called description) to the Bill of Rights, Constitution and
   Laws of Pennsylvania," against, he means, or for the purpose of detecting
   their imperfections.

   "Every Free Government," he says, "should consist of three parts, viz.
   1st, A Bill of Rights. 2dly, A Constitution. 3dly Laws."

   Remark. As freedom depends as much on the Execution as on the
   Constitution, I conceive there to be something wanting to make the
   description complete.

   "1st, The Bill of Rights should contain the great principles of natural
   and civil liberty. It should be to a community what the eternal laws and
   obligations of morality are to the conscience. It should be unalterable by
   any human power."

   Remark. "The Bill of Rights should contain the great principles of natural
   and civil liberty." This is a huge metaphysical expression, and I conceive
   an erroneous one. This gentleman frequently confounds rights with
   principles, and uses them synonymously. I conceive a Bill of Rights should
   be a plain positive declaration of the rights themselves: and, instead of
   saying it should "contain the great principles of natural and civil
   liberty," that it should retain such natural rights as are either
   consistent with, or absolutely necessary toward our happiness in a state
   of civil government; for were all the great natural rights, or principles,
   as this writer calls them, to be admitted, it would be impossible that any
   government could be formed thereon, and instead of being a Bill of Rights
   fitted to a state of civil government, it would be a Bill of Rights fitted
   to man in a state of nature without any government at all. It would be an
   Indian Bill of Rights.

   If a Bill of Rights, as this writer says, is to contain both natural and
   civil rights, then I cannot see how his following expression can be
   admitted, viz. "that it shall be unalterable by any human power." If we
   will have a Bill of Rights to be unalterable, it must be confined to
   natural rights only, for it is impossible to say what improvements may be
   made on civil ones; and as a matter of opinion for myself, I think it
   would be best so to do, and to comprehend all civil rights in that part
   which we call the Constitution; because, that is the part in which we are
   supposed to emerge from a state of nature, and erect ourselves into civil
   community for the mutual good and support of each other.

   But here a matter arises, which this gentleman, in his description of a
   Bill of Rights, ought particularly to have attended to, but has wholly
   omitted, viz. What are natural rights and what are civil ones? I answer, A
   natural right is an animal right; and the power to act it, is supposed,
   either fully or in part, to be mechanically contained within ourselves as
   individuals. Civil rights are derived from the assistance or agency of
   other persons; they form a sort of common stock, which, by the consent of
   all, may be occasionally used for the benefit of any. They are substituted
   in the room of some natural rights, either defective in power or dangerous
   in practice, and are contrived to fit the members of the community with
   greater ease to themselves and safety to others, than what the natural
   ones could the individual in a state of nature: for instance, a man has a
   natural right to redress himself whenever he is injured, but the full
   exercise of this, as a natural right, would be dangerous to society,
   because it admits him a judge in his own cause; on the other hand, he may
   not be able, and must either submit to the injury or expose himself to
   greater: Therefore, the civil right of redressing himself by an appeal to
   public justice, which is the substitute, makes him stronger than the
   natural one, and less dangerous. Either party likewise, has a natural
   right to plead his own cause; this right is consistent with safety,
   therefore it is retained; but the parties may not be able, nay, they may
   be dumb, therefore the civil right of pleading by proxy, that is, by a
   council, is an appendage to the natural right and the trial by jury, is
   perfectly a civil right common to both parties.

   I come now to the simile which this gentleman uses to illustrate his Bill
   of Rights by: "It should be," says he, "to a community what the eternal
   laws and obligations of morality are to the conscience." How "rights"
   which always imply inherent liberty can be compared with the laws of
   conscience, which always imply inherent restraint, I cannot conceive; they
   do not of their own natures admit of comparison. But this gentleman has
   unfortunately applied his comparison to the wrong part, for if a Bill of
   Rights be binding and restraining in the manner he expresses it, it is so
   not on the "community" because it is to them a prerogative, but on the
   Legislative and Executive powers, that they invade it not.

   II. "A CONSTITUTION," says our author, "is the executive part of the Bill
   of Rights. It should contain the division and distribution of the power of
   the people. The modes and forms of making laws, of executing justice, and
   of transacting business: Also the limitation of power, as to time and
   jurisdiction. It is to a community what modes of worship are in religion.
   It should be unalterable by the legislature, and should be changed only by
   a representation of the people, chosen for that purpose." The last period
   is fully admitted.

   Remark. How the "Constitution" can be called the "Executive part of the
   Bill of Rights," I am quite at a loss to conceive. The Constitution must
   be considered as a dead letter till put into execution by some external
   object; it has not the power of action in itself, therefore cannot be
   regarded as the executive of any thing. It should contain, says he, "the
   division and distribution of the power of the people," the modes and forms
   "of transacting business": These expressions are obscure. The Constitution
   does not "contain the division and distribution of the power of the
   people," but describes the portions of power with which the people invest
   the legislative and executive bodies, and the portions which they retain
   for themselves. His description, as I conceive, is partly unjust and
   partly perplexed; and the simile, by which he means to illustrate it,
   wholly unnatural. A Constitution, says he, "is to a community what modes
   of worship are in religion." I think it is a great deal more; a man may be
   religiously happy without modes, but he cannot be civilly happy without a
   Constitution. But taking this gentleman on his own plan it will follow,
   that, if a constitution "'contains the divisions and distributions of the
   power of the people," then must "modes of worship" contain the division
   and distribution of the power of religion. Again, if the Constitution be
   the "executive part of the Bill of Rights," then must "modes of worship be
   the executive part of the eternal laws and obligations of morality."

   The fault of this gentleman is, that he writes straight forward without
   regard to consistency.

   III. "Laws are the executive part of a constitution. They cease to be
   binding whenever they transgress the principles of Liberty, as laid down
   in the Constitution and Bill of Rights. They are to a community what the
   practice of morality is in religion."

   Remark. There is the same confusion of ideas in this description as in the
   former two. Laws should be made consistent with and agreeable to the
   Constitution and the Bill of Rights. They naturally cease to be binding
   when they oppose them, and when they vary from them, must be amended, and
   this is all that can be said. But to suppose "LAWS executive" is a false
   conception: And how is it possible to compare "Laws" which are in
   themselves motionless and have no capacity of action, with the practice of
   morality, which not only implies motion, but the power of continuing it,
   and even of generating it, is, to me, and, I believe, to all others,
   incomprehensible. But to take this gentleman again on his own grounds; if
   the "laws" be, as he says, "the executive part of the Constitution," then
   must "the practice of morality" be the "executive part of modes of
   worship," which no man, not even the writer of it, can give his consent
   to.

   Having laid down these three paragraphs, he proceeds to "apply them," but
   what he means by applying them I cannot conceive, as all that follows
   might as well stand without them as with them.

   Whatever faults or defects the Constitution has, and no doubt it has some
   (for I suppose nothing is perfect, nor ever will), it ought to be every
   man's wish to have them pointed out, and every man's duty to have them
   amended; but I see no use can arise from this loose unconnected way of
   writing, but the propagation of further errors.

   Several very scurrilous pieces under different signatures have appeared in
   the papers on both sides the question. In Dunlap's paper of the 18th of
   March is a piece signed "Common Sense" which is the only one that is mine
   since the dispute first began. The design of that piece is to keep men in
   temper with each other, and to show the impropriety of having our minds
   taken up about a form of government (which we can reconsider at any time)
   till we knew whether we should have one of our own forming or of the
   enemy's. And, as a man ought to be ashamed to publish any thing which he
   is ashamed to own, I have therefore put a signature to this by which I
   shall be known; and have likewise left my real name with the Printer,
   which he is welcome to give to any one that requires it.

   COMMON SENSE.
