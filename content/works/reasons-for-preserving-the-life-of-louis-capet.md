Title: Reasons for Preserving the Life of Louis Capet
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:52 EDT 2014

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   After it was revealed during his trial that the king had been conspiring
   with the French emigres and the courts of Europe to wage war upon the
   people of France, the Jacobins demanded the death of the king. Having
   failed to avoid the trial, the Girondins now sought to soften the verdict
   on the king, advocating that he be banished or interned. Paine supported
   this position, not because of any deference on his part to Royalty but
   because he feared that the execution of the king would give England a
   useful pretext for declaring war against France, and because he still
   could not forget that the king had once aided America gain her
   independence. In this address, a French translation of which was read to
   the National Convention on January 15, 1793, Paine pleaded with the
   delegates that they should not give "the tyrant of England the triumph of
   seeing the man perish on the scaffold who had aided my much-beloved
   America to break his chains."

   PRESIDENT: My hatred and abhorrence of monarchy are sufficiently known:
   they originate in principles of reason and conviction, nor, except with
   life, can they ever be extirpated; but my compassion for the unfortunate,
   whether friend or enemy, is equally lively and sincere.

   I voted that Louis should be tried, because it was necessary to afford
   proofs to the world of the perfidy, corruption and abomination of the
   monarchical system. The infinity of evidence that has been produced
   exposes them in the most glaring and hideous colors; thence it results
   that monarchy, whatever form it may assume, arbitrary or otherwise,
   becomes necessarily a center round which are united every species of
   corruption, and the kingly trade is no less destructive of all morality in
   the human breast, than the trade of an executioner is destructive of its
   sensibility. I remember, during my residence in another country, that I
   was exceedingly struck with a sentence of M. Autheine at the
   Jacobins[Club], which corresponds exactly with my own idea-"Make me a king
   to-day," said he, "and I shall be a robber to-morrow."

   Nevertheless, I am inclined to believe that if Louis Capet had been born
   in obscure condition, had he lived within the circle of an amiable and
   respectable neighborhood, at liberty to practise the duties of domestic
   life, had he been thus situated, I cannot believe that he would have shown
   himself destitute of social virtues; we are, in a moment of fermentation
   like this, naturally little indulgent to his vices, or rather to those of
   his government; we regard them with additional horror and indignation; not
   that they are more heinous than those of his predecessors, but because our
   eyes are now open, and the veil of delusion at length withdrawn; yet the
   lamentable, degraded state to which he is actually reduced, is surely far
   less imputable to him than to the Constituent Assembly, which, of its own
   authority, without consent or advice of the people, restored him to the
   throne.

   I was in Paris at the time of the flight, or abdication of Louis XVI, and
   when he was taken and brought back. The proposal of restoring him to
   supreme power struck me with amazement; and although at that time I was
   not a French citizen, yet as a citizen of the world I employed all the
   efforts that depended on me to prevent it.

   A small society, composed only of five persons, two of whom are now
   members of the Convention, took at that time the name of the Republican
   Club (Societe Republicaine). This society opposed the restoration of
   Louis, not so much on account of his personal offenses, as in order to
   overthrow the monarchy, and to erect on its ruins the republican system
   and an equal representation.

   With this design, I traced out in the English language certain
   propositions, which were translated with some trifling alterations, and
   signed by Achille Duchatelet, now Lieutenant-General in the army of the
   French Republic, and at that time one of the five members which composed
   our little party: the law requiring the signature of a citizen at the
   bottom of each printed paper.

   The paper was indignantly torn by Malouet1;  and brought forth in this
   very room as an article of accusation against the person who had signed
   it, the author and their adherents; but such is the revolution of events,
   that this paper is now received and brought forth for a very opposite
   purpose-to remind the nation of the errors of that unfortunate day, that
   fatal error of not having then banished Louis XVI from its bosom, and to
   plead this day in favor of his exile, preferable to his death. The paper
   in question was conceived in the following terms:  

   Having thus explained the principles and the exertions of the republicans
   at that fatal period, when Louis was reinstated in full possession of the
   executive power which by his flight had been suspended, I return to the
   subject, and to the deplorable situation in which the man is now actually
   involved.

   What was neglected at the time of which I have been speaking, has been
   since brought about by the force of necessity. The willful, treacherous
   defects in the former Constitution have been brought to light; the
   continual alarm of treason and conspiracy aroused the nation, and produced
   eventually a second revolution. The people have beat down royalty, never,
   never to rise again; they have brought Louis Capet to the bar, and
   demonstrated in the face of the whole world, the intrigues, the cabals,
   the falsehood, corruption, and rooted depravity, the inevitable effects of
   monarchical government. There remains then only one question to be
   considered, what is to be done with this man?

   For myself I seriously confess, that when I reflect on the unaccountable
   folly that restored the executive power to his hands, all covered as he
   was with perjuries and treason, I am far more ready to condemn the
   Constituent Assembly than the unfortunate prisoner Louis Capet.

   But abstracted from every other consideration, there is one circumstance
   in his life which ought to cover or at least to palliate a great number of
   his transgressions, and this very circumstance affords to the French
   nation a blessed occasion of extricating itself from the yoke of kings,
   without defiling itself in the impurities of their blood.

   It is to France alone, I know, that the United States of America owe that
   support which enabled them to shake off the unjust and tyrannical yoke of
   Britain. The ardor and zeal which she displayed to provide both men and
   money, were the natural consequence of a thirst for liberty. But as the
   nation at that time, restrained by the shackles of her own government,
   could only act by the means of a monarchical organ, this organ-whatever in
   other respects the object might be-certainly performed a good, a great
   action.

   Let then those United States be the safeguard and asylum of Louis Capet.
   There, hereafter, far removed from the miseries and crimes of loyalty, he
   may learn, from the constant aspect of public prosperity, that the true
   system of government consists not in kings, but in fair, equal and
   honorable representation.

   In relating this circumstance, and in submitting this proposition, I
   consider myself as a citizen of both countries. I submit it as a citizen
   of America, who feels the debt of gratitude which he owes to every
   Frenchman. I submit it also as a man, who, although the enemy of kings,
   cannot forget that they are subject to human frailties. I support my
   proposition as a citizen of the French Republic, because it appears to me
   the best, the most politic measure that can be adopted.

   As far as my experience in public life extends, I have ever observed, that
   the great mass of the people are invariably just, both in their intentions
   and in their objects; but the true method of accomplishing an effect does
   not always show itself in the first instance. For example; the English
   nation had groaned under the despotism of the Stuarts. Hence Charles I
   lost his life; yet Charles II was restored to all the plenitude of power,
   which his father had lost. Forty years had not expired when the same
   family strove to re-establish their ancient oppression; so the nation then
   banished from its territories the whole race. The remedy was effectual.
   The Stuart family sank into obscurity, confounded itself with the
   multitude, and is at length extinct.

   The French nation has carried her measures of government to a greater
   length. France is not satisfied with exposing the guilt of the monarch.
   She has penetrated into the vices and horrors of the monarchy. She has
   shown them clear as daylight, and forever crushed that system; and he,
   whoever he may be, that should ever dare to reclaim those rights would be
   regarded not as a pretender, but punished as a traitor.

   Two brothers of Louis Capet have banished themselves from the country; but
   they are obliged to comply with the spirit and etiquette of the courts
   where they reside. They can advance no pretensions on their own account,
   so long as Louis Capet shall live.

   Monarchy, in France, was a system pregnant with crime and murders,
   cancelling all natural ties, even those by which brothers are united. We
   know how often they have assassinated each other to pave a way to power.
   As those hopes which the emigrants had reposed in Louis XVI, are fled, the
   last that remains rests upon his death, and their situation inclines them
   to desire this catastrophe, that they may once again rally around a more
   active chief, and try one further effort under the fortune of the
   ci-devant Monsieur and D' Artois2. That such an enterprise would
   precipitate them into a new abyss of calamity and disgrace, it is not
   difficult to foresee; yet it might be attended with mutual loss, and it is
   our duty as legislators not to spill a drop of blood when our purpose may
   be effectually accomplished without it.

   It has already been proposed to abolish the punishment of death, and it is
   with infinite satisfaction that I recollect the humane and excellent
   oration pronounced by Robespierre on that subject in the Constituent
   Assembly3. This cause must find its advocates in every corner where
   enlightened politicians and lovers of humanity exist, and it ought above
   all to find them in this assembly.

   Monarchical governments have trained the human race, and inured it to the
   sanguinary arts and refinements of punishment; and it is exactly the same
   punishment which has so long shocked the sight and tormented the patience
   of the people, that now, in their turn, they practice in revenge upon
   their oppressors. But it becomes us to be strictly on our guard against
   the abomination and perversity of monarchical examples: as France has been
   the first of European nations to abolish royalty, let her also be the
   first to abolish the punishment of death, and to find out a milder and
   more effectual substitute.

   In the particular case now under consideration, I submit the following
   propositions: 1st, That the National Convention shall pronounce sentence
   of banishment on Louis and his family, 2d, That Louis Capet shall be
   detained in prison till the end of the war, and at that epoch the sentence
   of banishment to be executed.
