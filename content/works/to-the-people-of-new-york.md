   THE election for Charter officers last year was carried by the federal and
   quid trick of fortifications and now the people are to be amused and duped
   to a new obstruction.

   The only eligible mode of obstruction is that proposed by Franklin for the
   Delaware in '76 an account of which was given in the Public Advertiser of
   the 8th inst and republished in the Philadelphia Aurora of the 13th
   August.

   The plan of obstruction now proposed for New York is by blocks, that is,
   by solid bodies of stone or earth in the manner of wharves. This was first
   suggested by Selah Strong, Chairman of the Committee of the Corporation,
   and in a publication by Mr. Stevens of Hoboken, which contains many just
   observations on ships and batteries. He adopts the same unfortunate idea
   of obstruction by blocks. The blocks to be "25 or 30 feet square or larger
   at the distance of 50 or 60 feet from each other." And the editor of the
   New York American Citizen in introducing Mr. Smith's piece in his paper of
   Saturday last, says, "Why not, to make assurance doubly sure," to give us
   in fact protection, carry the obstruction by blocks or otherwise entirely
   cross from Robin's Reef to Mud Flat.

   This most certainly would prevent hostile ships coming to the city, and it
   is equally as certain it would prevent the tide coming up and lay the
   wharves at New York dry, and be the ruin of all the towns on the North
   River that depend for commerce on tidewater, This, the projectors of
   obstructors by blocks never thought of; but projectors should think of
   everything or they will make ruinous work. If Selah Strong's project is
   adopted New York is ruined, for the obstruction by blocks cannot
   afterwards be removed.

   Every alteration made in the channel of a water course, whether it be in
   the natural current of a river or the current of a tide, will cause
   another alteration some where else.

   If the obstruction be across the natural current of a river like the
   obstruction of a mill dam, the water will continue rising till it overtops
   the obstruction or overflows the country above; for as the daily supply
   from the source will continue the same it will have a passage somewhere.

   If the obstruction be to the tidewater, the effect will be, that the
   tidewater will rise to the same height at the place where the obstruction
   is as it did before and no higher, but the channel above the obstruction
   will be deprived of tidewater.

   The stone piers of a bridge lessen the quantity and extent of tidewater
   above the bridge. This everybody knows that knows anything of hydraulics.
   But to know it as a fact, if any person will look into Salmon's geography
   or Guthrie's geographical grammar, he will find, in their account of
   rivers and bridges in England, that before Westminster bridge was built,
   which was begun in 1738 the tide flowed up to Kingston about 17 or 18
   miles above Westminster, but since the bridge has been built it flows no
   higher than Richmond which-is four miles short of Kingston. Now, if the
   piers of a bridge lessened the quantity of tide-water, and shortened its
   extent four miles out of 17 or 18 miles, what must be the effect of a
   total, or even semi-total, obstruction by blocks of the channel between
   Robin's Reef and Mud Flat on the wharves at the city and on the long
   course of the North River?

   In projecting obstructions two things are absolutely necessary to be taken
   into view. The one is, the least possible obstruction to the water up or
   down; the other is, that the obstruction be such as can be removed
   afterwards. Neither of these entered the mind of the projectors of blocks,
   and both are embraced in the plan of Franklin. His frames had very little
   effect on the tide or the stream; and after the enemy went away they were
   taken up; but all the power and art of Man could not remove solid blocks
   of stone or earth 25 or 30 feet square sunk several feet below the surface
   of the water.

   If the channel between Robin's Reef and Mud Flat is not more than about 36
   feet it can be obstructed as the Delaware was and the obstruction can be
   defended by gunboats and batteries, and the militia can defend the shore
   as the people of Norfolk have done; but for men to be always employing
   themselves on imaginary fortifications or skulking behind, or within
   obstruction like a turtle within his shell, lest the crows should pick
   him, has a very cowardly appearance. It is not the spirit of "the times
   that tried men's souls!'
