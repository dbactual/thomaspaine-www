   To Citizen Barrere  September 5, 1793

   I send you the papers you asked me for.

   The idea you have to send Commissioners to Congress, and of which you
   spoke to me yesterday, is excellent, and very necessary at this moment.
   Mr. Jefferson, formerly Minister of the United States in France, and
   actually Minister for Foreign Affairs at Congress, is an ardent defender
   of the interests of France. Gouverneur Morris, who is here now, is badly
   disposed towards- you. I believe he has expressed the wish to be recalled.
   The reports which he will make on his arrival will not be to the advantage
   of France. This event necessitates the sending direct of Commissioners
   from the Convention. Morris is not popular in America. He has set the
   Americans who are here against him, as also the Captains of that Nation
   who have come from Bordeaux, by his negligence with regard to the affair
   they had to treat about with the Convention. Between us he told them:
   "That they had thrown themselves into the lion's mouth, and it was for
   them to get out of it as best they could." I shall return to America on
   one of the vessels which will start from Bordeaux in the month of October.
   This was the project I had formed, should the rupture not take place
   between America and England; but now it is necessary for me to be there as
   soon as possible. The Congress will require a great deal of information,
   independently of this. It will soon be seven years that I have been absent
   from America, and my affairs in that country have suffered considerably
   through my absence. My house and farm buildings have been entirely
   destroyed through an accidental fire.

   Morris has many relations in America, who are excellent patriots. I
   enclose you a letter which I received from his brother, General Lewis
   Morris, who was a member of the Congress at the time- of the Declaration
   of Independence. You will see by it that he writes like a good patriot. I
   only mention this so that you may know the true state of things. It will
   be fit to have respect for Gouverneur Morris, on account of his relations,
   who, as I said above, are excellent patriots.

   There are about 45 American vessels at Bordeaux, at the present moment. If
   the English government wished to take revenge on the Americans, these
   vessels would be very much exposed during their passage. The American
   captains left Paris yesterday. I advised them, on leaving, to demand a
   convoy of the Convention, in case they heard it said that the English had
   begun reprisals against the Americans, if only to conduct as far as the
   Bay of Biscay, at the expense of the American government. But if the
   Convention determines to send Commissioners to Congress, they will be sent
   in a ship of the line. But it would be better for the Commissioners to go
   in one of the best American sailing vessels, and for the ship of the line
   to serve as a convoy; it could also serve to convey the ships that will
   return to France charged with flour. I am sorry that we cannot converse
   together, but if you could give me a rendezvous, where I could see Mr.
   Otto, I shall be happy and ready to be there. If events force the American
   captains to demand a convoy, it will be to me that they will write on the
   subject, and not to Morris, against whom they have grave reasons of
   complaint.

   Your friend, etc.

   THOMAS PAINE
