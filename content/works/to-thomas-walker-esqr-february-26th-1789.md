   To Thomas Walker, Esqr.  February 26th, 1789

   DEAR SIR:

   Your favor of the 23d is just come to hand for which I thank you. I wrote
   to the President of the Board of Works last Monday, wishing him to begin
   making preparations for erecting the arch. I am so confident of his
   judgment that I can safely rely upon his going on as far as [he] pleases
   without me, and at any rate I shall not be long before I revisit
   Rotherham.

   I had a letter yesterday from Mr. Foljambe, 'apologizing for his being
   obliged unexpectedly to leave town without calling on me, but that he
   should be in London again in a few days. He concludes his letter by
   saying:

   "I saw the Pile of *your Bridge. In point of elegance and beauty it far
   exceeded my expectations, and is certainly beyond anything I ever saw."

   You will please inform the President what Mr. Foljambe says, as I think
   him entitled to participate in the applause. Mr. Fox of Derby called again
   on me last evening respecting the Bridge but I was not at home. There is a
   project of erecting a Bridge at Dublin which will be a large undertaking
   and as the Duke of Leicester and the other Deputies from Ireland are
   arrived, I intend making an opportunity of speaking to them on that
   business.

   With respect to news and politics the King is certainly greatly amended
   but what is to follow from it is a matter of much uncertainty. How far the
   nation may be safe with a man of a deranged mind at the head of it and
   who, ever since he took up the notion of quitting England and going to
   live in Hanover, has been continually planning to entangle England with
   German connections, which if followed must end in a war, is a matter that
   will occasion various opinions. However unfortunate it' may have been for
   the sufferer, the King's malady has been no disservice to the Nation. He
   was burning his fingers very fast in the German war and whether he is
   enough in his senses to keep out of the fire is a matter of doubt.

   You mention the Rotherham address as complimenting Mr. Pitt on the success
   of his administration and for asserting and supporting the Rights of the
   People. I differ exceedingly from you in this opinion, and I think the
   conduct of the opposition much nearer to the principles of the
   Constitution, than what the conduct of the Ministry was. So far from Mr.
   Pitt asserting and supporting the Rights of the people, it appears to me
   taking them away; but as a man ought not to make an assertion without
   giving his reasons I will give you mine.

   The English Nation is composed of two orders of men-Peers and Commoners.
   By Commoners is properly meant every man in the Nation not having the
   title of Peer, and it is the existence of those two orders setting up
   distinct and opposite claims, the one hereditary and the other elective
   that makes it necessary to establish a third order or that known by the
   name of the Regal Power or the Power of the Crown.  o

   The Regal Power is the Majesty of the Nation collected to a center and
   residing in the Person exercising the Regal Power. The Right, therefore,
   of a Prince is a Right standing on the Right of the whole Nation. But Mr.
   Pitt says it stands on the Right of Parliament. Is not Parliament composed
   of two houses one of which is itself hereditary and over which the people
   have no control and in the establishment of which they have no election,
   and the other house the representatives of only a small part of the Nation
   ? How then can the Rights of the People be asserted and supported by
   absorbing them into an hereditary house of Peers? Is not one hereditary
   power or Right as dangerous as the other, and yet the addressers have all
   gone on the error of establishing power in the house of Peers over whom,
   as I have already said, they have no control for the inconsistent purpose
   of opposing it in the prince over whom they have some control.

   It was one of those cases in which there ought to have been a National
   Convention elected for the express purpose, for if government be permitted
   to alter itself, or any of the parts permitted to alter the other there is
   no fixed Constitution in the country. And if the Regal Power, or the
   person exercising the Regal Power, either as King or Regent, instead of
   standing on the universal ground of the Nation be made the mere creature
   of Parliament, it is, in my humble opinion, equally inconsistent and
   unconstitutional as if Parliament was the mere creature of the Crown.

   It is a common idea in all countries that to take Power from the Prince is
   to give liberty to the people, but Mr. Pitt's conduct is almost the
   reverse of this. His is to take power from one part of the government to
   add it to another, for he has increased the power of the Peers, not the
   Rights of the People. I must give him credit for his ingenuity, if I do
   not for his principles, and the less so because the object of his conduct
   is now visible, which was to [keep] themselves in pay after they should be
   out of [favor] by retaining, through an act of Parliament of their own
   making, between four and five hundred thousand pounds of the Civil List in
   their own hands. This is the key of the whole business, and it was for
   this and not for the Rights of the people, that he set up the Right of
   Parliament, because it was only by that means that the spoil could be
   divided. If the restriction [on the Prince Regent] had been that he should
   not declare war or enter into foreign alliance without the consent of
   Parliament, the object would have been National and have had some sense in
   them, but it is, that he should not have all the money. If Swift was alive
   he would say-"Spit on such Patriotism."

   How they will manage with Ireland I have had no opportunity of learning as
   I have not been at the other end of the town since the commissioners
   arrived. Ireland will certainly judge for itself and not permit the
   English Parliament or Doctor's to judge for her. Thus much for Politics.

   I very sincerely congratulate you and the families on the probable
   recovery of Mr. Jonathan Walker and hope soon to have the pleasure that it
   may come to hand before you receive the final orders of your loom mending
   officer, and as I have written it all off at a dash, and have to go out to
   dinner to the other end of the town, I do not hold myself accountable for
   errors. With sincere respect to all the families, and in hopes of seeing
   you in London before I set off to Rotherham, I am Sir, your sincere friend
   and humble servant.

   THOMAS PAINE.
