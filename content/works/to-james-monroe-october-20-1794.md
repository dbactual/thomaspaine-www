   From the original letter at the Librray of Congress.
   
   Vendr 30

   Dear Sir

   I received your friendly letter of the 26 Vendre. on the day
   it was written, & I thank you for communicating to me your opinion upon
   my Case. Ideas serve to beget Ideas, and as it is from a review of
   every thing that can be said upon a subject, or is any ways connected with
   it, that the best judgment can be formed how to proceed, I present you
   with such Ideas as occur to me. I am sure of one thing, which is, that you
   will give them a patient and attentive perusal.

   You say in your letter that "I must be sensible that although I am an
   American Citizen yet if you interfere in my behalf as the minister of my
   Country you must demand my liberation only in case there be no charge
   against me, and that if there is that I must be brought to trial previously,
   since no person in a *private* character can be exempt from the laws of the
   Country in which he resides." &mdash; This is what I have twice attempted to 
   do. I wrote a letter on the 3d Sans Culottodi to the deputies, members of the
   Committee of surety general who came to the Luxembourg to examine the
   persons detained. - The letter was as follows -

   "Citizens Representatives 
   
   I offer myself for examination. Justice is due to every man. It is justice only 
   that I ask. - Thomas Paine"

   As I was not called for examination nor heard any thing in consequence of
   my letter the first time of sending it, I sent a duplicate of it a few
   days after. It was carried to them by my good friend and comrade Van-huele
   who was then going in liberty having been examined the  day before.
   Van-huele wrote me on the next day and said - Bourdon de l'Oise (who was one of 
   the anamemsy(?) deputies) is the most
   inveterate Enemy you can have. The answer he gave me when I presented your
   letter put me in such a passion with him that I expected I should be sent
   back again to prison. I then wrote a third letter but had not an
   opportunity of sending it as Bourdon did not come any more till after I
   received Mr. Labonadaire's letter advising me to write to the Convention.
   The letter was as follows &mdash; "Citizens, I have twice offered myself for 
   examination, and I chose to do
   this while Bourdon de l'Oise was one of the Commissioners. This deputy has
   said in the Convention that I intrigued with an ancient agent of the
   Bureau of foreign Affairs. My examination therefore while he is present
   will give him an opportunity of proving his charge or of convincing
   himself of his error. If Bourdon de l'Oise is an honest man he will
   examine me, but lest he should not I subjoin the following &mdash; That which
   B &mdash; calls an intrigue was at the request of a member of the former
   Committee of Salat public last August was twelve month. I met the
   member on the Boulevard. He asked me something in French which I did not
   understand and we went together to the Bureau of foreign Affairs which
   was near at hand. The agent (Otto, whom you probably knew in America)
   served as interpreter. The member (it was Barrere) then asked me 1st if I could 
   furnish him with the plan of Constitution I had presented to the Committee of
   Constitution of which I was member with himself, because, he said, it
   contained several things which he wished had been adopted - 2dly He
   asked me my opinion upon sending Commissioners to the United States of
   America - 3dly - If fifty or an hundred ship loads of flour could be
   procured from America. As verbal interpretation was tedious it was agreed that 
   I should give him my opinion in writing and that the Agent should translate it 
   which he did - I answered the first question by sending him the plan, which he 
   still has - To the second I replied that I thought
   it would be proper to send Comrs., because that in revolutions
   Circumstances change so fast that it was often necessary to send a better
   supply of information to an ally than could be communicated by letter writing, 
   and that Congress had done the same thing during the American war and I
   gave him some information that the Commissioners would find useful on
   their arrival. I answered the third question by sending him a list of American 
   Exports to years before, distinguishing the several Articles by which he would
   see that the supply he mentioned could be obtained. - I sent him also the
   plan of Paul Jones, giving it as his, for procuring salt petre, which was
   to send a squadron (it did not require a large one) to take possession of
   the Island of St. Helen's, to keep the English flag flying at the port
   that the English East India ships coming from the East Indies, and that
   ballast with Salt petre might be induced to enter as usual, and that it
   would be a considerable time before the English Government could know of
   what had happened at St. Helen's - See here what Bourdon de l'Oise has
   called an intrigue - If it was an Intrigue it was between a member of the 
   Committee of Salut public and
   myself, for the Agent was no more than the interpreter and translator, and
   the object of the intrigue was to furnish France with flour and
   salt petre &mdash; I suppose Bourdon had heard that the Agent and I were seen 
   together talking English, and this was enough for *him* to found his charge 
   upon -

   You next say that "I must likewise be sensible that although I am an
   American Citizen that it is likewise believed there that I am
   become a Citizen of france, and that in consequence this latter character
   has so far    the former as to weaken if not destroy any claim
   you might have to interpose in my behalf." &mdash; I am sorry I cannot add any 
   new arguments to those I have already advanced
   on this part of the subject. - But I cannot help asking myself, and I wish
   you would ask the Committee, if it could possibly be the intention of
   France to *kidnap* Citizens from America under the pretense of dubbing them
   with the title of french Citizens, and then after inviting or rather
   inveigling them into France make it a pretense for detaining them. If it
   was, (which I am sure it was not, tho' they now act as if it was) the
   insult was to America, tho the injury was to me, and the treachery was
   to both. Did they mean to kidnap General Washington Mr. Madison, and
   several other Americans whom they dubbed with the same title as well as
   me. Let any man look at the condition of france when I arrived in it, invaded
   by Austrians and prussians and declared to be in danger, and then ask if
   any man who had a home and a Country to go to as I had in America, would
   have come amongst them from any other motive than of assisting them. If I
   could possibly have supposed them capable of treachery I certainly would
   not have trusted myself in their power. Instead therefore of your being
   unwilling or apprehensive of meeting the question of french Citizenship
   they ought to be ashamed of advancing it, and this will be the case unless
   you admit their arguments or objections to passively. It is a Case on
   their part fit only for the continuations of Robespierre to set up.
   As to the name of french Citizen I never considered it in any other
   light, so far as regarded myself, than as a token of honorary respect. I
   never made them any promise nor took any oath of allegiance or of
   Citizenship, nor bound myself by any act or means whatever to the
   performance of anyvthing. I acted altogether as a friend invited among them
   as I supposed, on honorable terms. I did not come to join myself to a
   Government already formed, but to assist in forming one de nouveau, which
   was afterwards to be submitted to the people whether they would accept it
   or not, and this any foreigner might do. And strictly speaking there are
   no Citizens before this a government. They are all of the People. The
   Americans were not called Citizens till after Government was established,
   and not even then until they had taken the oath of Allegiance. This was
   the Case in Pennsylvania. &mdash; But be this french Citizenship more or less 
   the Convention have now swept it
   away by declaring me to be a foreigner, and imprisoning me as such, and
   this is a short answer to all those who affect to say or to believe that I
   am french Citizen. A Citizen without Citizenship is a term non-descript.

   After the two preceding paragraphs you as - "If it be my wish that you
   should embark in this controversy (meaning that of reclaiming me) and risque 
   the consequences with respect to myself and the good understanding
   subsisting between the two Countries, or, without relinquishing any point
   of right, and which might be insisted on in case of extremities, pursue
   according to your best judgment and with the light before you, the object
   of my liberation?"

   As I believe from the apparent obstinacy of the Committees that
   circumstances will grow towards the extremity you mention unless prevented
   before hand I will endeavour to throw into your hands all the light I can
   upon the subject.

   In the first place, reclamation may mean two distinct things - All the
   reclamations that are made by the sections in behalf of persons detained
   as *suspect* are made on the ground that the persons so detained are
   patriots, and the reclamation is good against the charge of suspect
   because it proves the contrary. &mdash; But my situation includes another 
   Circumstance I am imprisoned on the
   charge (if it can be called one) of being a foreigner born in England. You
   know that foreigner to be a citizen of the United States of America, and
   that he has been such since the 4th of July 1776 the political
   birth-day of the United States and of every American Citizen, for before
   that period all were British subjects, and the States, then provinces,
   were British dominions. &mdash; Your reclamation of me therefore as a citizen 
   of the United States (all
   other considerations apart) is good against the pretense for imprisoning
   me, or that pretense is equally good against every American Citizen born
   in England, Ireland Scotland, Germany or Holland, and you know this
   description of men compose a very great part of the population of the
   three states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and make also a
   part of Congress, and of the State legislatures.

   Every politician ought to know, and every Civilian does know, that the Law
   of Treaty be superior to every other Law where it applies. Now the Treaty of 
   Alliance and also that of Amity and Commerce knows no
   distinction of American Citizens on account of the place of their birth,
   but recognizes all to be Citizens whom the Constitution and laws of the
   United States of America recognize as such, and if I recollect rightly
   there is an article in the Treaty of Commerce particular to this point.
   The law therefore which they have here to put all persons in arrestation
   born in any of the Countries at war with France, is, when applied to
   Citizens of America born in England Ireland, Scotland, Germany or
   Holland, a violation of the treaties of Alliance and of Commerce, because
   it assumes to make a distinction of Citizens which those Treaties and the
   Constitution of America knows nothing of. This is a subject that officially
   comes under your cognizance as Minister and it would be consistent that
   you expostulated with them upon the Case.
   That foolish old man Vadier who was president of the Convention and of
   the Committee of surety general, when the Americans then in Paris went to
   the Bar of the Convention to reclaim me, gave them for answer that my
   being born in England was cause sufficient for imprisoning me. It happened
   that at least half those who went up with that address were in the same
   Case with myself.

   As to reclamations on the ground of Patriotism it is difficult to know
   what is to be understood by Patriotism here. There is not a Vice, and
   scarcely a Virtue, that has not as the fashion of the moment suited been
   called by the name of Patriotism. The wretches who composed the
   revolutionary tribunal of Nantes were the Patriots of that day and the
   Criminals of this. The Jacobins called themselves Patriots of the first
   order, men up to the height of the Circumstances, and they are now
   considered as an Antidote to Patriotism. But if we give to Patriotism a
   fixed Idea consistent with that of a Republic it would signify a strict
   adherence to the principles of moral Justice, to the equality of civil and
   political Rights, to the System of representative government, and an
   opposition to every hereditary claim to govern; and of this species of
   Patriotism you know my character.

   But, Sir, there are men on the Committee who have changed their Party but
   not their principles. Their aim is to hold power as long as possible by
   preventing the establishment of a Constitution, and these men are and will
   be my Enemies, and seek to hold me in prison as long as they can. I am too
   good a Patriot for them. It is not improbable that they have heard of the
   strange language held by some Americans that I am not considered in
   America as an American Citizen, and they may also have heard say, that you
   had no orders respecting me, and it is not improbable that they interpret
   that language and that silence into a Connivance at my imprisonment. If they 
   had not some Ideas of this kind would they resist so long the
   civil efforts you make for my liberation, or would they attach so much
   importance to the imprisonment of an Individual as *to risque* (as you say to
   me) *the good understanding that exists between the two countries*. - You also
   say that *it is impossible for any person to do more than you have done
   without adopting the other means*, meaning that of reclaiming me. How then
   can you account for the want of success after so many efforts, and such a
   length of time, upwards of ten weeks, without supposing that they fortify
   themselves in the interpretation I have just mentioned.
   I can admit that it was not necessary to give orders, and that it
   was difficult to give direct orders, for I much question if Morris had
   informed Congress or the President of the whole of the Case, or had sent
   copies of my letters to him as I had desired him to do. You would find the
   Case here when you came, and you could not fully understand it till you
   did come, and as Minister you would have authority to act upon it. But as
   you inform me that you know what the wishes of the President are, you will
   see also that his reputation is exposed to some risque admitting there to
   be ground for the supposition I have made.
   It will not add to his popularity to have it believed in America, as I am
   inclined to think the Committee believe here, that he connives at my
   imprisonment. &mdash; You say also *that it is known to everybody that you wish 
   my liberation*. It is, Sir, because they know your wishes that they
   misinterpret the means you use. They suppose that those mild means arise
   from a restriction that you cannot use others, or from a consciousness of
   some defect on my part of which you are unwilling to provoke the enquiry.

   But as you ask me if it be my wish that you should embark in this
   controversy and risque the consequences with respect to myself, I will
   answer this part of the question by marking out precisely the part I wish
   you to take. What I mean is a sort of middle line above what you have yet
   gone, and not up to the full extremity of the Case, which will still lie
   in reserve. It is to write a letter to the Committee, that shall in the
   first place, defeat by anticipation all the objections they might make to a
   simple reclamation, and at the same time make the ground good for that
   object. But instead of sending the letter immediately to invite some of
   the Committee to your house and to make that invitation the opportunity of
   shewing them the letter, expressing at the same time a wish that you had
   done this, from a hope that the business might be settled in an amicable
   manner without your being forced into an official interference, that would
   excite the observations of the Enemies of both Countries, and probably
   interrupt the harmony that subsisted between the two Republics.

   But as I cannot convey the Ideas I wish you to use by any means so
   concisely or so well as to suppose myself the writer of the letter, I shall
   adopt this method, and you will make use of such parts or such Ideas of it
   as you please if you approve the plan. - Here follows the supposed letter.

   Citizens 
   
   When I first arrived among you, as Minister from the United
   States of America, I was given to understand that the liberation of Thomas
   Paine would take place without any official interference on my part. This
   was the more agreeable to me, as it would not only supersede the necessity
   of that interference, but would leave to yourselves the whole opportunity
   of doing justice to a man who as far as I have been able to learn has
   suffered much cruel treatment under what you have denominated the System
   of Terror. But as I find my expectations have not been fulfilled I am
   under the official necessity of being more explicit upon the subject than
   I have hitherto been.

   Permit me, in the first place, to observe that as it is impossible for me
   to suppose that it could have been the intention of France to seduce any
   Citizens of America from their allegiance to their proper Country by
   offering them the title of french Citizen, so must I be compelled to
   believe, that the title of french Citizen conferred on Thomas Paine was
   intended only as a mask of honorary respect towards a man who had so
   eminently distinguished himself in defence of liberty, and on no occasion
   more so than in promoting and defending your own revolution. For a proof
   of this I refer you to his two works entitled *Rights of Man*. Those works
   have procured to him an addition of esteem in America, and I am sorry they
   have been so ill rewarded in France. But be this title of french Citizen
   more or less it is now entirely swept away by the Vote of the Convention
   which declares him to be a foreigner and which supersedes the Vote of the
   Assembly that conferred that title upon him, consequently upon the Case
   superseded with it.

   In consequence of this Vote of the Convention declaring him to be 
   foreigner the former Committees have imprisoned him. It is therefore
   become my official duty to declare to you that the foreigner thus
   imprisoned is a Citizen of the United States of America as fully as
   legally and as constitutionally as myself, and that he is moreover one of the
   principal founders of the American Republic.

   I have been informed of a law or decree of the Convention which subjects
   foreigners born in any of the Countries at war with france to arrestation
   and imprisonment. This law when applied to Citizens of America born in
   England is an infraction of the Treaty of Alliance and of Amity and
   Commerce, which knows no distinction of American Citizens on account of
   the place of their birth, but recognizes all to be Citizens whom the
   Constitution and laws of America recognize as such. The Circumstances
   under which America has been peopled requires this guard on her treaties,
   because the mass of her Citizens are composed not of natives only but also
   of the natives of almost all the countries of Europe who have sought an
   Asylum there from the persecutions they experienced in their own
   Countries. After this intimation you will without doubt see the propriety of 
   modeling that Law to the principles of the Treaty because the law of Treaty in
   cases where it applies is the governing law to both parties alike, and 
   cannot be infracted by either without hazarding the existence of the Treaty.

   Of the Patriotism of Thomas Paine I can speak fully if we agree to give
   to patriotism a fixed Idea consistent with that of a republic. It would
   then signify a strict adherence to moral Justice - to the equality of civil
   and political Rights, to the System of representative government - and an
   opposition to all hereditary claims to govern. - Admitting patriotism to
   consist in these principles, I know of no man who has gone beyond Thomas
   Paine in promulgating and defending them and that for almost twenty years
   past.

   I have now spoken to you on the principal matters concerned in the case of
   Thomas Paine &mdash; The title of french Citizen which you had conforced upon
   him and have since taken away by declaring him to be foreigner and
   consequently this part of the subject ceases of itself. - I have declared to
   you that this foreigner is a citizen of the United States of America, and I
   have assured you of his patriotism.

   I cannot help, at the same time, repeating to you my wish that his
   liberation had taken place without my being obliged to go thus far into
   the subject, because it is the mutual interest of both republics to avoid
   as much as possible all subjects of controversy especially such from
   which no possible good can flow. &mdash; I still hope that you will save 
   me the unpleasant task of proceeding any
   farther by sending me an order for his liberation, and which the injured state
   of his health absolutely requires. I shall be happy to receive such an
   order from you and happy in presenting it to him, for to the welfare of
   Thomas Paine the Americans are not and cannot be indifferent.
   
   &mdash; 
   
   This is the sort of letter I wish you to write for I have no Idea that
   you will succeed by any measures that can, by any kind of Construction, be
   interpreted into a want of confidence or an apprehension of consequences. - It 
   is themselves that ought to be apprehensive of consequences if any are
   to be apprehended. They, I mean the Committees are not certain that the
   Convention or the Nation would support them in forcing any question of
   extremity that might interrupt *the good* understanding subsisting between
   the two Countries, and I know of no question to do this as
   that which involves the rights and liberty of a Citizen.

   You will please to observe that I have put the case of french Citizenship
   in a point of view that ought not only to preclude, but to make them
   ashamed to advance, any thing upon this subject and this is better than to
   have to answer their counter-reclamation afterwards - Either the
   Citizenship was intended as a token of honorary respect, or it was in-
   tended to deprive America of a Citizen or to seduce him from his
   Allegiance to his proper Country. If it was intended as an honour they must
   act consistently with the principle of honour. But if they make a pretense
   for detaining me they convict themselves of the Act of Seduction.
   Had America singled out any particular french Citizen, complimented him
   with the title of Citizen of America, which he without suspecting any
   fraudulent intention might accept, and then after having invited or rather
   inveigled him into America made his acceptance of that Title a pretense
   for seducing or forcing him from his allegiance to France would not
   France have just cause to be offended at America? And ought not America to
   have the same Right to be offended at France? And will the Committees take
   upon themselves to answer for the dishonour they bring upon the National
   Character of their Country? If these arguments are stated before-hand they will 
   prevent the Committees
   going into the subject of french Citizenship. They must be ashamed of it. - 
   But after all the Case comes to this that this french Citizenship
   appertains no longer to me because the Convention as I have already said,
   have swept it away by declaring me to be a foreigner, and it is not in the
   power of the Committees to reverse it. But if I am to be Citizen &
   foreigner, and Citizen again just when and how and for any purposes they
   please they take the Government of America into their own hands or make
   her only a Cypher in their system.

   Though these Ideas have been long with me they have been more particularly
   matured by reading your last communication, and I have many reasons to
   wish you had opened that Communication sooner. - I am best acquainted with
   the persons you have to deal with and the circumstances of my own Case. - If
   you chuse to adopt the letter as it is I send you a translation for the
   sake of expediting the business. I have endeavoured to conceive your own
   manner of expression as well as I could and the civility of language you
   would use, but the matter of the letter is essential to me.

   If you chuse to confer with some of the members of the Committee at your
   own house on the subject of the letter it may render the sending it
   unnecessary; but in either case I must request and press you not to give
   way to evasion and delay and that you will fix positively with them that
   they shall give you an answer in three or four days whether they will
   liberate me on the representation you have made in the letter or whether
   you must be forced to go further into the subject. The state of my health
   will not admit of delay, and besides this the tortured state of my mind wears
   me down.

   If they talk of bringing me to trial (and I well know there is no
   accusation against me and that they can bring none) I certainly shall
   summon you as an Evidence to my Character. This you may mention to them
   either as what I intend to do or what you intend to do voluntarily for me.

   I am anxious that you undertake this business without losing time, because
   if I am not liberated in the course of this decade, I intend, if in case
   the seventy one detained deputies are liberated, to follow the same track
   that they have done and publish my own Case myself. I cannot rest any
   longer in this state of miserable suspense be the consequences what they
   may.

   THOMAS PAINE
