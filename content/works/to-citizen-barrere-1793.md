   To Citizen Barrere  1793

   You mentioned to me that saltpetre was becoming scarce. I communicate to
   you a project of the late Captain Paul Jones, which, if successfully put
   in practice, will furnish you with that article.

   All the English East India ships put into St. Helena, off the coast of
   Africa, on their return from India to England. A great part of their
   ballast is saltpetre. Captain Jones, who had been at St. Helena, says that
   the place can be very easily taken. His proposal was to send off a small
   squadron for that purpose, to keep the English flag flying at port. The
   English vessels will continue coming in as usual. By this means it will be
   a long time before the Government of England can have any knowledge of
   what has happened. The success of this depends so much upon secrecy that I
   wish you would translate this yourself, and give it to Barrere.

   THOMAS PAINE.
