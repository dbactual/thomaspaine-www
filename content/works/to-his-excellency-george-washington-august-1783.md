   To his Excellency George Washington  [August, 1783]

   SIR:

   The Bearer of this, Mr. Darby, who is introduced to this country by Mr.
   Laurens, was a pupil of mine in London about twelve or fourteen years ago.
   His curiosity to see the great world of America has induced him to take
   the voyage and make the tour of it. As it is his intention to visit camp
   and wait on your Excellency, I presume on the liberty of adding this, to
   other introductions he is furnished with to your Excellency.

   Mr. Darby waiting for this will I hope apologize for its incorrectness.

   I enclose your Excellency a copy of the Address of the citizens to
   Congress, which, will I hope put an end to the affair. It is signed by
   near a thousand of the principal merchants and inhabitants.

   I send you the paper of today. The account of the entertainment given to
   the officers is too concise; it will be fuller in the papers of tomorrow.
   There were present the President of the State, the French Minister, and
   almost every person of note and rank in the city. The voluntary was the
   best received I ever knew a toast in my life or none was ever more so.

   I likewise enclose you a paper containing a letter to Fairfax, respecting
   the instructions from this place.

   As I have much to write to your Excellency upon, I request you would not
   regard this as a letter but only a line or two, on account of the
   gentleman who bears it, and the opportunity of enclosing you a few papers.

   I just now learn that five Spanish officers have obtained furloughs for
   six months to visit your Excellency and are in the river.

   I am Sir with every wish for your happiness,

   Your Excellency's much obliged and humble obedient servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Compliments to the gentlemen of your family.
