   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Luxemburg - 29th Thermidor

   My Dear Sir

   As I believe none of the public papers have announced your name right I am
   unable to address you by it - but a *new* minister from America is joy to me
   and will be so to every American in France.

   Eight months I have been imprisoned, and I know not for what, except that
   the order says - that I am a Foreigner - The Illness I have suffered in this
   place (and from which I am but just recovering) had nearly put an end to
   my existence - My life is but of little value to me in this situation
   tho I have borne it with a firmness of Patience and fortitude.

   I enclose you a Copy of a letter (as well the translations as the
   English) - which I sent to the Convention after the fall of the Monster,
   Robespierre - for I was determined not to write a line during the time of
   his detestable influence; I sent also a copy to the Comite of public
   safety - but I have not heard any thing respecting it - 
   
   I have now no
   expectation of delivery but by your means - Morris has been my inveterate
   enemy, and I think he has permitted something of the national character of
   America to suffer by quietly letting a Citizen of that Country remain
   almost eight months in prison without making every official exertion to
   procure him justice - for every act of Violence offered to a foreigner is
   offered also to the Nation to which he belongs -

   The gentleman who will present you this, has been very
   friendly to me - Wishing you happiness in your appointment - I am your
   affectionate Friend & Hble s\Servt.

   THOMAS PAINE &mdash;
