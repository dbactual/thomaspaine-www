   To James Monroe  August 17, 1794

   LUXEMBOURG,

   MY DEAR SIR:

   As I believe none of the public papers have announced your name right I am
   unable to address you by it, but a new minister from America is joy to me
   and will be so to every American in France.

   Eight months I have been imprisoned, and I know not for what, except that
   the order says that I am a Foreigner. The illness I have suffered in this
   place (and from which I am but just recovering) had nearly put an end to
   my existence. My life is but of little value to me in this situation
   though I -have borne it with a firmness of patience and fortitude.

   I enclose you a copy of a letter (as well the translations as the
   English), which I sent to the Convention after the fall of the Monster
   Robespierre-for I was determined not to write a line during the time of
   his detestable influence. I sent also a copy to the Committee of Public
   Safety-but I have not heard any thing respecting it. I have now no
   expectation of delivery but by your means-Morris has been my inveterate
   enemy, and I think he has permitted something of the national character of
   America to suffer by quietly letting a Citizen of that Country remain
   almost eight months in prison without making every official exertion to
   procure him justice,-for every act of violence offered to a foreigner is
   offered also to the Nation to which he belongs.

   The gentleman, Mr. Beresford, who will present you this has been very
   friendly to me. Wishing you happiness in your appointment, I am your
   affectionate friend and humble servant.

   THOMAS PAINE.
