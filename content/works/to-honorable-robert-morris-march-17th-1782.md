   To Honorable Robert Morris  March 17th, 1782

   SUNDAY,

   SIR:

   I mentioned to General Washington by note this morning-a wish to have his
   company at my apartment to eat a few Oysters or a crust of Bread and
   Cheese in company with you some evening before he went away from Town on
   the matter I mentioned. The enclosed is his answer in which he refers it
   to your convenience. But it will be time enough after your evening
   business tomorrow-and unless it is tomorrow, I do not see how it can take
   place, though I much wish it.

   As soon as I get your answer, I shall either see or send to the General.

   I am, Sir, Your Obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
