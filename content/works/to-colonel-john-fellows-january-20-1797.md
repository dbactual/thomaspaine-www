   To Colonel John Fellows  January 20, 1797

   PARIS,

   SIR:

   Your friend Mr. Caritat being on the point of his departure for America, I
   make it the opportunity of writing to you. I received two letters from you
   with some pamphlets a considerable time past, in which you inform me of
   your entering a copyright of the first part of the Age of Reason: when I
   return to America we will settle for that matter.

   As Dr. Franklin has been my intimate friend for thirty years past you will
   naturally see the reason of my continuing the connection with his
   grandson. I printed here (Paris) about fifteen thousand of the second part
   of the Age of Reason, which I sent to Mr. F[ranklin] Bache. I gave him
   notice of it in September 1795 and the copy-right by my own direction was
   entered by him. The books did not arrive till April following, but he had
   advertised it long before.

   I sent to him in August last a manuscript letter of about 70 pages, from
   me to Mr. Washington to be printed in a pamphlet. Mr. Barnes of
   Philadelphia carried the letter from me over to London to be forwarded to
   America. It went by the ship Hope, Cap [tain] Harley, who since his return
   from America told me that he put it into the post office at New York for
   Bache. I have yet no certain account of its publication. I mention this
   that the letter may be enquired after, in case it has not been published
   or has not arrived to Mr. Bache. Barnes wrote to me, from London 29 August
   informing me that he was offered three hundred pounds sterling for the
   manuscript. The offer was refused because it was my intention it should
   not appear till it appeared in America, as that, and not England was the
   place for its operation.

   You ask me by your letter to Mr. Caritat for a list of my several works,
   in order to publish a collection of them. This is an undertaking I have
   always reserved for myself. It not only belongs to me of right, but nobody
   but myself can do it; and as every author is accountable (at least in
   reputation) for his works, he only is the person to do it. If he neglects
   it in his life-time the case is altered. It is my intention to return to
   America in the course of the present year. I shall then [do] it by
   subscription, with historical notes. As this work will employ many persons
   in different parts of the Union, I will confer with you upon the subject,
   and such part of it as will suit you to undertake, will be at your choice.
   I have sustained so much loss, by disinterestedness and inattention to
   money matters, and by accidents, that I am obliged to look closer to my
   affairs than I have done. The printer (an Englishman) whom I employed here
   to print the second part of the Age of Reason made a manuscript copy of
   the work while he was printing it, which he sent to London and sold. It
   was by this means that an edition of it came out in London.

   We are waiting here for news from America of the state of the federal
   elections. You will have heard long before this reaches you that the
   French government has refused to receive Mr. Pinckney as minister. While
   Mr. Monroe was minister he had the opportunity of softening matters with
   this government, for he was in good credit with them though they were in
   high indignation at the infidelity of the Washington Administration. It is
   time that Mr. Washington retire, for he has played off so much prudent
   hypocrisy between France and England that neither government believes
   anything he says.

   Your friend, etc.,

   THOMAS PAINE.
