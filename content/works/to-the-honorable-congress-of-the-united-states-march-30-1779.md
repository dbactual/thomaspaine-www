   To the Honorable Congress of the United States  March 30, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   On the 19th Inst. I applied by letter to this honorable House, requesting
   a copy of their proceedings respecting me from January 26 to January 16th,
   the day on which the papers of the foreign committee were taken out of my
   keeping. And by a personal application to Mr. Thomson your Secretary I
   have since learned that nothing has been done thereon.

   I am thus laid under the necessity of renewing my application to Congress
   for copies of all papers and Proceedings respecting me, except copies of
   my own Letters of January 6th, 7th, 8th, and March 19th.

   Were I asking a favor I should address my language accordingly, but my
   application being a matter of right, I cannot discredit the latter by
   giving it the disguise of the former. I conceive that the character of no
   Person can be constitutionally secure, where a formal judgment can be
   discretionarily produced and published and the grounds and proceedings on
   which that judgment is founded withheld, or subject to future and private
   alterations.

   Congress have published their judgment in a Resolution of January 12th and
   I have a right to know the proceedings. That resolution is prefaced in the
   Pennsylvania Packet with a letter signed "]ohn Jay"; yet as far as I have
   a right to know, that letter may be spurious; for as I have never been
   wanting in any duty I could perform, or service I could render, to America
   or her allies, I ought not to believe that the Honorable President of
   Congress would address a letter to the Minister (see footnote 1) of
   France, which by a very close laid implication holds me up as deserving
   the "Indignation and resentment of both countries."

   I ought likewise not to believe, that at the time I was innocently
   suffering public abuse for endeavoring, in the sincerity of good will to
   justify this honorable House from Mr. Deane's libellous publication of
   December 5th, that any gentleman, a member of this House, would add to the
   burthen of that undertaking so necessary at that time to the injured and
   insulted character of Congress, and withal feel so little for himself and
   the dignity of the State he represented, as to prefer the dishonor of the
   libel by discrediting the detection of the libeller.

   Neither ought I to believe, that, while, apprehensive of clandestine
   conduct in Mr. Deane to the injury and inconvenience of the United States,
   I was endeavoring, both officially and otherwise, to collect information
   on the points in question respecting his proceedings that any Member of
   this honorable House would use his vote and influence to prevent such
   information, and thereby to fix on his constituents, a Man, who, there
   were many reasons to believe was unworthy their esteem and undeserving
   their confidence.

   Furnished with opportunities and anxious in my wishes to support the
   interest of the United States, I very soon became possessed of many
   suspicious circumstances respecting Mr. Deane and judging to what issue
   they would lead and render at that time of the personal reputation of
   Congress, I sent in the most pressing letters of January 6th, 7th and 8th
   hoping thereby to prevent a precipitate determination on a business which
   to my knowledge was not sufficiently before the House, the result of
   which, I had reason to conclude, would contradict the beginning. For
   though Congress might have reasons to declare that the supplies were not a
   present from His most Christian Majesty, yet the reasons could form no
   grounds whereon to conclude they were "not a present" because the
   commissioners letter of the 30th of November, 1777 would have informed you
   that you were left "to consider them as the effects of private
   benevolence!

   Thus frustrated in my endeavors to promote the interest of the United
   States, to cement the affections of the countries in alliance, and to
   guard even the Personal honor of Congress, by detection in the first
   instance, and by intimation in the last, I am now anxious to know what
   returns they severally made to me, that I may not render evil for good.

   I am Honorable Sirs Your Honors obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   1. The resolution Paine refers to read: "That in answer to the memorials
   of the honorable Sieur Gerard, minister plenipotentiary of his most
   Christian Majesty, of the 5th and 10th instant the president be directed
   to assure the said Minister, that Congress do fully, in the clearest and
   most explicit manner, disavow the publications referred to in his said
   memorials, and as they are convinced by indisputable evidence, that the
   supplies shipped in the Amphitrite, Seine, and Mercury were not a present,
   and that his most Christian Majesty, the great and generous ally of these
   United States, did not preface his alliance with any supplies whatever
   sent to America, so they have not authorized the writer of the said
   publications to make any such assertions as are contained therein, buton
   the contrary, do highly disapprove of the same."-Editor.
