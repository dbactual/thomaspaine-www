   SIR:

   For your satisfaction and my own, I send you the enclosed though I do not
   apprehend there will be any occasion to use it. If, in case there should,
   you will immediately send a line for me under cover to Mr. Johnson, St.
   Paul's Church-Yard, who will forward it to me, upon which I shall come and
   answer personally for the work. Send also to Mr. Home Tooke.

   T.P.

   SIR:

   Should any person, under the sanction of any kind of authority, enquire of
   you respecting the author and publisher of the Rights of Man, you will
   please to mention me as the author and publisher of that work, and show to
   such person this letter. I will, as soon as I am made acquainted with it,
   appear and answer for the work personally.

   Your humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
