   To Thomas Jefferson  January 25, 1805

   NEW YORK,

   DEAR SIR:

   I wrote you on the 1st January from N[ew] Rochelle and mentioned spending
   part of the winter at Washington. But as the present state of the weather
   renders the passage of the rivers dangerous and travelling precarious I
   have given up the intention. Mr. Levi Lincoln and Mr. Wingate called on me
   at N[ew] York, where I happened to be when they arrived from Washington to
   the Eastward. I find by Mr. Lincoln that the Louisiana Memorialists will
   have to return as they came and the more decisively Congress put an end to
   this business the better. The Cession of Louisiana is a great acquisition;
   but great as it is it would be an incumbrance on the Union were the prayer
   of the petitioners to be granted, nor would the lands be worth settling if
   the settlers are to be under a French jurisdiction. If they have a mind to
   have a Chamber of Commerce, or a Court of Arbitration, to settle their own
   private affairs with each other, in their own language, perhaps no
   inconvenience may arise to us from it; but with respect to government and
   legal jurisdiction they must for several years yet to come be under the
   same laws of Congress which the Americans themselves are under who settle
   in Louisiana. It will never answer to make French Louisiana the
   legislators of the new settlers. Perhaps no inconvenience would arise by
   permitting the two territories to have each of them two representatives in
   Congress one of which to be an American. The Cession of Louisiana is a new
   case not provided for in the Constitution and must be managed by prudence
   and justice. When the emigrations from the United States into Louisiana
   become equal to the number of French inhabitants it may then be proper and
   right to erect such part where such equality exists into a constitutional
   state; but to do it now would be sending the American settlers into exile.
   I think (for I write just what thoughts come in my mind) Congress would do
   right to divide the country into states as far as it is known, as was
   formerly done in the case of the western territory, subject to such
   revision as a future survey of the country shall show to be necessary and
   to give names to them as in the former case. The arm of the Louisian[i]ans
   appear to me to be that of governing Louisiana in the lump and this will
   put a stop to that expectation. If Congress cannot do this in the present
   session it might give directions so as to have something like a map or a
   survey ready against the next session, and to frame a form of internal
   government for them to continue till they arrived at a state of population
   proper for constitutional government. When this be done the country will
   be in a condition to be settled and the settlers will know beforehand the
   government and the laws they are to be under. For my own part, I wish the
   name of Louisiana to be lost, and this may in a great measure be done by
   giving names to the new states that will serve as descriptive of their
   situation or condition. France has lost the names and almost the
   remembrance of provinces by dividing them into departments with
   appropriate names.

   Next to the acquisition of the territory and the Government of it is that
   of settling it. The people of the Eastern States are the best settlers of
   a new country, and of people from abroad the German peasantry are the
   best. The Irish in general are generous and dissolute. The Scotch turn
   their attention to traffic, and the English to manufactures. These people
   are more fitted to live in cities than to be cultivators of new lands. I
   know not if in Virginia they are much acquainted with the importation of
   German redemptioners, that is, servants indented for a term of years. The
   best farmers in Pennsylvania are those who came over in this manner or the
   descendants of them. The price before the war used to be twenty pounds
   Pennsylvania currency for an indented servant for four years, that is, the
   ship owner, got twenty pounds per head passage money, so that upon two
   hundred persons he would receive after their arrival four thousand pounds
   paid by the persons who purchased the time of their indentures which was
   generally four years. These would be the best people, of foreigners, to
   bring into Louisiana-because they would grow to be citizens. Whereas
   bringing poor Negroes to work the lands in a state of slavery and
   wretchedness, is, besides the immorality of it, the certain way of
   preventing population and consequently of preventing revenue. I question
   if the revenue arising from ten Negroes in the consumption of imported
   articles is equal to that of one white citizen. In the articles of dress
   and of the table it is almost impossible to make a comparison.

   These matters though they do not belong to the class of principles are
   proper subjects for the consideration of Government; and it is always
   fortunate when the interests of Government and that of humanity act
   unitedly. But I much doubt if the Germans would come to be under a French
   Jurisdiction. Congress must frame the laws Under which they are to serve
   out their time; after which Congress might give them a few acres of land
   to begin with for themselves and they would soon be able to buy more. I am
   inclined to believe that by adopting this method the Country will be more
   peopled in about twenty years from the present time than it has been in
   all the times of the French and Spaniards. Spain, I believe, held it
   chiefly as a barrier to her dominions in Mexico, and the less it was
   improved the better it agreed with that policy; and as to France she never
   showed any great disposition or gave any great encouragement to
   colonizing. It is chiefly small countries, that are straitened for room at
   home, like Holland and England, that go in quest of foreign settlements.

   I have again seen and talked with the gentleman from Hamburg. He tells me
   that some Vessels under pretence of shipping persons to America carried
   them to England to serve as soldiers and sailors. He tells me he has the
   Edict or Proclamation of the Senate of Hamburg forbidding persons shipping
   themselves without the consent of the Senate, and that he will give me a
   copy of it, which if he does soon enough I will send with this letter. He
   says that the American Consul has been spoken to respecting this
   kidnapping business under American pretences, but that he says he has no
   authority to interfere. The German members of Congress, or the
   Philadelphia merchants or ship-owners who have been in the practice of
   importing German redemptioners, can give you better information respecting
   the business of importation than I can. But the redemptioners thus
   imported must be at the charge of the Captain or ship owner till their
   time is sold. Some of the Quaker Merchants of Philadelphia went a great
   deal into the importation of German servants or redemptioners. It agreed
   with the morality of their principles that of bettering people's
   condition, and to put an end to the practice of importing slaves. I think
   it not an unreasonable estimation to suppose that the population of
   Louisiana may be increased ten thousand souls every year. What retards the
   settlement of it is the want of laborers, and until laborers can be had
   the sale of the lands will be slow. Were I twenty years younger, and my
   name and reputation as well known in European countries as it is now, I
   would contract for a quantity of land in Louisiana and go to Europe and
   bring over settlers.

   I think you will see the propriety of taking some measures upon this
   affair, for besides being injurious to us and to the American character it
   is a wicked piece of business. Perhaps it may afford an opportunity of
   saying something that may be acceptable to the Senate of Hamburg, for
   where a civil thing can be said on good principles it is always worth
   saying.

   I also send you a letter I lately received from an old revolutionary
   soldier in Kentucky. It is much better written than one would expect from
   a person of that standing. Perhaps some of the Kentucky members may know
   him.

   It is probable that towards the close of the session I may make an
   excursion to Washington. The piece on Gouverneur Morris's Oration on
   Hamilton and that on the Louisiana Memorial are the last I have published;
   and as everything of public affairs is now on a good ground I shall do as
   I did after the War, remain a quiet spectator, and attend now to my own
   affairs.

   I intend making a collection of all the pieces I have published, beginning
   with Common Sense, and of what I have by me in manuscript, and publish
   them by subscription. I have deferred doing this till the presidential
   election should be over, but I believe there was not much occasion for
   that caution. There is more of hypocrisy than bigotry in America. When I
   was in Connecticut the summer before last, I fell in company with some
   Baptists among whom were three ministers. The conversation turned on the
   election for President, and one of them who appeared to be a leading man
   said, "They cry out against Mr. Jefferson, because they say he is a Deist.
   Well, a Deist may be a good man and if he think it right it is right to
   him." "For my own part," said he, "I had rather vote for a Deist than for
   a blue skin presbyterian." "You judge right," said I, "for a man that is
   not of any of the sectaries will hold the balance even between all; but
   give power to a bigot of any sectary and he will use it to the oppression
   of the rest, as the blue-skins do in connection." They all agreed in this
   sentiment, and I have always found it assented to in any company I have
   had occasion to use it.

   I judge the collection I speak of will make five volumes octavo of four
   hundred pages each at two dollars a volume to be paid for on delivery; and
   as they will be delivered separately as fast as they can be printed and
   bound, the subscribers may stop when they please. The three first volumes
   will be political and each piece will be accompanied with an account of
   the state of affairs whether in America, France or England, at the time it
   was written which will also show the occasion of writing it. The first
   expression in the first No. of the Crisis published the 19th. December '76
   is, ''These are the times that try men's souls." It is therefore necessary
   as explanatory to the expression in all future times to show what those
   times were. The two last volumes will be theological and those who do not
   choose to take them may let them alone. They will have the right to do so
   by the conditions of the subscription. I shall also make a miscellaneous
   volume of correspondence, essays and some pieces of poetry which I believe
   have some claim to originality.

   I have again seen and canvassed with the gentleman from Hamburg. He
   occupies the store of the house where I lodge. He is a wholesale merchant
   in dry goods, has been several times backward and forward from Hamburg to
   New York, and in one of his voyages came with 175 German redemptioners. He
   says he will engage them and have them indented to him for four years and
   deliver them together with their indentures to some merchant or agent at
   New Orleans and receive upon the delivery of them 12 guineas (56 dollars)
   per head. That merchant or agent will  sell the time of their indentures,
   four years which will at least be worth eighty dollars, or I may say one
   hundred. It will fetch more than that in New York.

   As the person who buy their time will have to find them in clothes, he
   must not turn them naked upon the world; and therefore the custorn in
   Pennsylvania was, and I believe it was provided for by law that their
   master at the end of their time furnished them with two covering suits,
   that is two of everything and if Congress, as I before said, were to give
   each of them twenty acres of land, they would soon become cultivators for
   themselves and other redemptioners would arrive to supply their places,
   and the present French inhabitants would soon be a minority and the sooner
   the better for they give symptoms of being a troublesome set.

   This appears to me to be the best and quickest method of peopling,
   cultivating and settling Louisiana and we shall gain by it a useful
   industrious set of citizens. The ten dollars bounty money I spoke of in
   the former part of this case become unnecessary.

   There is too much detail in this business to bring it immediately before
   Congress, neither is there information enough at present to make a law
   that shall exactly fit the case. The best and shortest way will be for
   Congress to empower the President to devise and employ means for bringing
   cultivators into Louisiana from any of the European countries who after
   the expiration of the time of their indentures will more than pay the
   expense. I suppose it will be necessary to appoint an agent to whom they
   are to be delivered at N[ew] Orleans who will account for the monies paid
   and received. When this business is once set agoing it will go on of
   itself. But I think Congress ought to make the first adventure to give
   encouragement to it.

   While this letter was in hand I fell in company with a N[ew] York captain
   of a Vessel, who was lately at N[ew] Orleans. He says that the number of
   Americans, including the garrison, is about equal to the number of French
   inhabitants in the town of N[ew] Orleans. This is an additional reason for
   not admitting the French memorialists to be legislators in their own
   language. Could they get the power of legislation and government in their
   hands they would probably appoint courts to judge of claims, and you would
   find some of the best lands in Louisiana covered with claims. I think it
   not an unreasonable suspicion that this is one of their objects. I
   observed in the French revolution that they always proceeded by stages and
   made each stage a stepping stone to another. The convention, to amuse the
   people, voted a Constitution, and then voted to suspend the practical
   establishment of it till after the war and in the meantime to carry on a
   revolutionary government. When Robespierre fell they proposed bringing
   forward the suspended constitution, and apparently for this purpose
   appointed a committee to frame what they called organic laws and those
   organic laws turned out to be a new constitution (the Directory
   constitution which was in general a good one). When Bonaparte overthrew
   this constitution he got himself appointed pro consul for ten years, then
   for life; and now Emperor with an hereditary succession. As to myself they
   first voted me out of the convention for being a foreigner, then
   imprisoned me on the ground of being a foreigner, then voted me in again
   by annulling the vote that declared me a foreigner. There will be no end
   to the claims of these Memorialists if you once begin to make a
   distinction in their favor between them and the American settlers. They
   must all be governed by the same law as of Congress till there are a
   sufficient number of American settlers to be trusted with constitutional
   powers, They might I think have a representation in Congress one of which
   as before mentioned to be an American.

   I find by the Captain above mentioned that several Liverpool ships have
   been at New Orleans. It is chiefly the people of Liverpool that employ
   themselves in the slave trade and they bring cargoes of those unfortunate
   Negroes to take back in return the hard money and the produce of the
   country. Had I the command of the elements I would blast Liverpool with
   fire and brimstone. It is the Sodom and Gomorrah of brutality.

   I have now written you a long letter. The subjects it treats of and the
   reasons given in support of them are more proper for private communication
   than for publication. It is that which distinguishes this letter from my
   answer to the Louisiana Memorial. The letter to you on the Domingo
   business is of the same kind. Now I am on the subject of public and
   private communication I will explain something to you regarding the note I
   sent you two years ago the first of last January when I was at Washington
   with respect to obtaining the Cession of Louisiana. The idea occurred to
   me without knowing it had occurred to another person and I mentioned it to
   Dr. Lieb who lived in the same house (Lovells) and as he appeared pleased
   with it I wrote the note and showed it to him before I sent it. The next
   morning you said to me that measures were already taken in that business.
   When Lieb returned from Congress I told him of it. I knew that said he.
   Why then, said I, did you not tell me so, because in that case I would not
   have sent the note. That is the reason, said he, I would not tell you
   because two opinions concurring on a case strengthen it.

   I do not however like Dr. Lieb's motion about Banks. Congress ought to be
   very cautious how it gives encouragement to this speculating project of
   banking, for it is now carried to an extreme. It is but another kind of
   striking paper money. I expect some of them will blow up, for they have
   already banked away the hard money. Were Dr. Lieb's motion to take place,
   it would, I suppose, make some additional clerks necessary at the
   treasury, because it would derange the simplicity of collecting the
   revenue. I view the Doctor's motion as an unwise attempt at popularity
   among those interested in [illegible] banks.

   Neither do I like the motion respecting the recession of the (Cession).
   The cession was made to the United States, and not to the representatives
   of the states, and if alteration be made it should be made by the consent
   of the state legislatures as in the case of altering any article of the
   constitution, for the seat of government ought to be considered as a part
   of the constitution. It was because the states had no place where their
   representatives in Congress could rightfully assemble, for Congress has
   not the right to place itself within the jurisdiction of any state, that
   [illegible] was made. I know that when I was clerk of the general assembly
   of Pennsylvania there was, upon some disagreement between the assembly as
   to Congress, a strong disposition in the assembly to signify to Congress
   to quit the state. The union has now a territory independent of any state
   belonging governmentally to all, yet some of the representatives of the
   states are assuming to fritter away the rights of their constituents.
   There is no foreseeing what occasion future Congresses in future times may
   have for territory, nor do I know if the dock be without or within the
   limits of the city. Somehow or other it happens by a comparison of things
   that Congress appears little to the generality of people when it sits in a
   little place. It is like a dwarf governing a mole-hill.

   I am just informed (January 24) there is a run on the Manhattan bank in
   this city occasioned by some difference between that and what is called
   the Merchants bank. Manhattan is the Indian name of N[ew] York island. If
   instead of Dr. Lieb's motion, the motion had been, that a certain
   proportion of the revenue should be collected in hard money and the rest
   in notes of the Bank of the United States, it would, I think, have been
   much wiser, because it would restrain the merchants in sending away the
   hard cash and fitting the chasm up with paper.

   I recollect when in France that you spoke of a plan of making the Negroes
   tenants on a plantation, that is, allotting each Negro family a quantity
   of land for which they were to pay to the owner a certain quantity of
   produce. I think that numbers of our free Negroes might be provided for in
   this manner in Louisiana. The best way that occurs to me is for Congress
   to give them their passage to New Orleans, then for them to hire
   themselves out to the planters for one or two years; they would by this
   means learn plantation business, after which to place the men on a tract
   of land as before mentioned. A great many good things may now be done, and
   I please myself with the idea of suggesting my thoughts to you.

   Old Captain Landais who lives at Brooklyn on Long Island opposite N[ew]
   York calls sometimes to see me. I knew him in Paris. He is a very
   respectable old man. I wish something had been done for him in Congress on
   his petition, for I think something is due to him. Nor do I see how the
   statute of limitations can consistently apply to him. The law in John
   Adams's administration which cut off all commerce and communication with
   France, cut him off from the chance of coming to America to put in his
   claim. I suppose that the claims of some of our merchants on England,
   France, and Spain is more than of 6 or 7 years' standing yet no law of
   limitation, that I know of, takes place between nation, or between
   individuals of different nations. I consider a statute of limitation to be
   a domestic law and only have a [illegible]. Dr. Miller one of the New York
   Senators in Congress knows Landais and can give you an account of him.

   Concerning my former letter on Domingo, I intended had I come to
   Washington to have talked with Pichon about it if you had approved that
   method, for it can only be brought forward in an indirect way. The two
   Emperors are at too great a distance in objects and in color to have any
   intercourse but by fire and sword, yet something I think might be done. It
   is time I should close this long epistle.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Any letters directed to me to the care of the Post Master N[ew] York will
   come to hand.
