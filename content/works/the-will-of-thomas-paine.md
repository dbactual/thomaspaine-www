   THE WILL

   The last Will and Testament of me, the subscriber, Thomas Paine, reposing
   confidence in my Creator, God, and in no other being, for I know of no
   other, nor believe in any other. I, Thomas Paine, of the State of New
   York, author of the work entitled "Common Sense," written in Philadelphia,
   in 1775, and published in that city the beginning of January, 1776, which
   awaked America to a declaration of independence on the fourth of July
   following, which was as fast as the work could spread through such an
   extensive country; author also of the several numbers of the "American
   Crisis," thirteen in all; published occasionally during the progress of
   the Revolutionary War-the last is on the peace; author also of "Rights of
   Man," parts the first and second, written and published in London, in 1791
   and 1792; author also of a work on religion, "Age of Reason," parts the
   first and second-N. B. I have a third part by me in manuscript, and an
   answer to the Bishop of Llandaff; author also of a work, lately published,
   entitled "Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from
   the Old, and called Prophecies concerning Jesus Christ, and showing there
   are no Prophecies of any such Person"; author also of several other works
   not here enumerated, "Dissertations on First Principles of
   Government-Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance-Agrarian
   Justice, etc., etc., make this my last will and testament, that is to say:

    I give and bequeath to my executors hereinafter appointed, Walter Morton
   and Thomas Addis Emmet, thirty shares I hold in the New York Phoenix
   Insurance Company, which cost me fourteen hundred and seventy dollars,
   they are worth now upwards of fifteen hundred dollars, and all my movable
   effects, and also the money that may be in my trunk or elsewhere at the
   time of my decease, paying thereout the expenses of my funeral, IN TRUST
   as to the said shares, movables, and money, for Margaret Brazier
   Bonneville, wife of Nicholas Bonneville, of Paris, for her own sole and
   separate use, and at her own disposal, notwithstanding her coverture.

    As to my farm in New Rochelle, I give, devise, and bequeath the same to
   my said executors, Walter Morton and Thomas Addis Emmet, and to the
   survivor of them, his heirs and assigns forever, IN TRUST nevertheless, to
   sell and dispose of the north side thereof, now in the occupation of
   Andrew A. Dean, beginning at the west end of the orchard, arid running in
   a line with the land sold to Coles, to the end of the farm, and to apply
   the money arising from such sale as hereinafter directed.

    I give to my friends Walter Morton, of the New York Phoenix Insurance
   Company, and Thomas Addis Emmet, counselor at law, late of Ireland, two
   hundred dollars each, and one hundred dollars to Mrs. Palmer, widow of
   Elihu Palmer, late of New York, to be paid out of the money arising from
   said sale; and I give the remainder of the money arising from that sale,
   one-half thereof to Clio Rickman, of High or Upper Mary-le-Bone Street,
   London, and the other half to Nicholas Bonneville, of Paris, husband of
   Margaret B. Bonneville, aforesaid: and as to the South part of the said
   farm, containing upwards of one hundred acres, in trust to rent out the
   same, or otherwise put it to profit, as shall be found most advisable, and
   to pay the rents and profits thereof to the said Margaret B. Bonneville,
   in trust for her children, Benjamin Bonneville, and Thomas Bonneville,
   their education and maintenance, until they come to the age of twenty-one
   years, in order that she may bring them well up, give them good and useful
   learning, and instruct them in their duty to God, and the practise of
   morality; the rent of the land, or the interest of the money for which it
   may be sold, as hereinafter mentioned, to be employed in their education.

    And after the youngest of the said children shall have arrived at the age
   of twenty-one years, in further trust to convey the same to the said
   children, share and share alike, in fee simple. But if it shall be thought
   advisable by my executors and executrix, or the survivors of them, at any
   time before the youngest of the said children shall come of age, to sell
   and dispose of the said south side of the said farm, in that case I hereby
   authorize and empower my said executors to sell and dispose of the same,
   and I direct that the money arising from such sale be put into stock,
   either in the United States Bank stock, or New York Phoenix Insurance
   Company stock, the interest or dividends thereof to be applied as is
   already directed for the education and maintenance of the said children,
   and the principal to be transferred to the said children, or the survivor
   of them, on his or their coming of age.

   I know not if the Society of people called Quakers, admit a person to be
   buried in their burying ground, who does not belong to their Society, but
   if they do, or will admit me, I would prefer being buried there; my father
   belonged to that profession, and I was partly brought up in it. But if it
   is not consistent with their rules to do this, I desire to be buried on my
   own farm at New Rochelle.

   The place where I am to be buried, to be a square of twelve feet, to be
   enclosed with rows of trees, and a stone or post and rail fence, with a
   headstone with my name and age engraved upon it, author of "Common Sense."
   I nominate, constitute, and appoint Walter Morton, of the New York Phoenix
   Insurance Company, and Thomas Addis Emmet, counselor at law, late of
   Ireland, and Margaret B. Bonneville, executors and executrix to this my
   last will and testament, requesting the said Walter Morton and Thomas
   Addis Emmet, that they will give what assistance they conveniently can to
   Mrs. Bonneville, and see that the children be well brought up. Thus
   placing confidence in their friendship, I herewith take my final leave of
   them and of the world.

    I have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time has been spent
   in doing good, and I die in perfect composure and resignation to the will
   of my Creator, God. Dated the eighteenth day of January, in the year one
   thousand eight hundred and nine; and I have also signed my name to the
   other sheet of this will, in testimony of its being a part thereof.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Signed, sealed, published, and declared by the testator, in our presence,
   who, at his request, and in the presence of each other, have set our names
   as witnesses thereto, the words "published and declared" first interlined.

   W M . KEESE, JAMES ANGEVINE, CORNELIUS RYDER.
