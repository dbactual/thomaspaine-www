   To Thomas Jefferson  February 19, 1788

   London, England,

   SIR:

   I mentioned to you that I had some conversation with the Marquis de
   Lafayette respecting the Bridge, and his opinion is that it would be best
   to make some direct proposition to which either yes or no should be given.
   My principal object is to get the Bridge erected because until then all
   conversation upon the subject amount to but little. My chief expectation
   as to the money part was on Mr. Morris but his affairs appearing to be
   deranged lessens very considerably that dependence. I am casting about to
   find some way to accomplish this point, or at least assist towards it
   before I return to America and the enclosed is on that subject. I shall be
   glad you would peruse it and give me your opinion, after which I will send
   it to the Marquis. If he and you concur in opinion respecting the
   propriety of it I will have it translated and presented to some of the
   Ministry-though perhaps it would be best to take some method to let it be
   first seen in order to know whether it will be agreeable that it should be
   presented. If you can return it to me tomorrow I will then send it to the
   Marquis.

   Your obedient humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
