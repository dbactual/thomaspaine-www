   To Doctor Benjamin Rush  June 13th, 1783

   SECOND STREET,

   SIR:

   I enclose you a copy of the original address, the reasons for so doing,
   are, not only that you may have an opportunity of showing it in the circle
   of your friends, but as many of them by sickness or otherwise, who may be
   cordially disposed to promote a measure, calculated to compose
   differences, and have not an opportunity of signing these which are
   circulating, may by this do it conveniently to themselves.

   But there are now many additional reasons for promoting the original
   address in preference, and almost in opposition to that manufactured by
   General Reed. By his leaving out the whole paragraph respecting the five
   percent, he has taken away one of the principal objects of the address,
   and which was calculated to give collateral support to the means
   recommended by Congress, for doing justice both to the foreign and
   domestic creditors of America.

   Besides, the original address was begun by those whom Mr. Dickinson have
   very good reason to believe his friends, and who intended it as a
   softening healing measure to all sides. But I apprehend Gen. R has catched
   at it as an opportunity of party, neither did he move in it until he saw
   the ground was made safe, by the countenance which the original address
   had obtained.

   As the general reasons of national honor and reputation, and the good
   policy of composing differences which if not composed in time may extend
   to further evils, will occur to you as readily as to any man, I forbear to
   mention them. Of one thing, however, I am certain, that when the matter is
   over, every good man, will be glad of it, and even these who may feel
   somehow displeased at the awkward situation of things, will find their
   situation much pleasanter by composing the affair.

   I thought it much better to send you an address entirely unsigned than one
   that was begun, because you may have an opportunity of beginning and
   conducting it as you please.

   I am Dear Sir, Your obedient humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
