   To George Jacques Danton May 6, 1793

   May sixth, Second year of the Republic [1793].

   PARIS,

   CITIZEN DANTON:

   As you read English, I write this letter to you without passing it through
   the hands of a translator. I am exceedingly disturbed at the distractions,
   jealousies, discontents and uneasiness that reign among us, and which, if
   they continue, will bring ruin and disgrace on the Republic. When I left
   America in the year 1787, it was my intention to return the year
   following, but the French Revolution, and the prospect it afforded of
   extending the principles of liberty and fraternity through the greater
   part of Europe, have induced me to prolong my stay upwards of six years. I
   now despair of seeing the great object of European liberty accomplished,
   and my despair arises not from the combined foreign powers, not from the
   intrigues of aristocracy and priestcraft, but from the tumultuous
   misconduct with which the internal affairs of the present Revolution are
   conducted.

   All that now can be hoped for is limited to France only, and I agree with
   your motion of not interfering in the government of any foreign country,
   nor permitting any foreign country to interfere in the government of
   France. This decree was necessary as a preliminary toward terminating the
   war. But while these internal contentions continue, while the hope remains
   to the enemy of seeing the Republic fall to pieces, while not only the
   representatives of the departments but representation itself is publicly
   insulted, as it has lately been and now is by the people of Paris, or at
   least by the tribunes, the enemy will be encouraged to hang about the
   frontiers and await the issue of circumstances.

   I observe that the confederated powers have not yet recognized Monsieur,
   or D'Artois, as regent, nor made any proclamation in favor of any of the
   Bourbons; but this negative conduct admits of two different conclusions.
   The one is that of abandoning the Bourbons and the war together; the other
   is that of changing the object of the war and substituting a partition
   scheme in the place of their first object, as they have done by Poland. If
   this should be their object, the internal contentions that now rage will
   favor that object far more than it favored their former object.

   The danger every day increases of a rupture between Paris and the
   departments. The departments did not send their deputies to Paris to be
   insulted, and every insult shown to them is an insult to the departments
   that elected and sent them. I see but one effectual plan to prevent this
   rupture taking place, and that is to fix the residence of the Convention,
   and of the future assemblies, at a distance from Paris.

   I saw, during the American Revolution, the exceeding inconvenience that
   arose by having the government of Congress within the limits of any
   municipal jurisdiction. Congress first resided in Philadelphia, and after
   a residence of four years it found it necessary to leave it. It then
   adjourned to the state of Jersey. It afterwards removed to New York; it
   again removed from New York to Philadelphia, and after experiencing in
   every one of these places the great inconvenience of a government, it
   formed the project of building a town, not within the limits of any
   municipal jurisdiction, for the future residence of Congress. In any one
   of the places where Congress resided, the municipal authority privately or
   openly opposed itself to the authority of Congress, and the people of each
   of these places expected more attention from Congress than their equal
   share with the other States amounted to. The same thing now takes place in
   France, but in a far greater excess.

   I see also another embarrassing circumstance arising in Paris of which we
   have had full experience in America. I mean that of fixing the price of
   provisions. But if this measure is to be attempted it ought to be done by
   the municipality. The Convention has nothing to do with regulations of
   this kind; neither can they be carried into practise. The people of Paris
   may say they will not give more than a certain price for provisions, but
   as they cannot compel the country people to bring provisions to market the
   consequence will be directly contrary to their expectations, and they will
   find dearness and famine instead of plenty and cheapness. They may force
   the price down upon the stock in hand, but after that the market will be
   empty.

   I will give you an example. In Philadelphia we undertook, among other
   regulations of this kind, to regulate the price of salt; the consequence
   was that no salt was brought to market, and the price rose to thirty-six
   shillings sterling per bushel. The price before the war was only one
   shilling and sixpence per bushel; and we regulated the price of flour
   (farina) till there was none in the market, and the people were glad to
   procure it at any price.

   There is also a circumstance to be taken into the account which is not
   much attended to. The assignats are not of the same value they were a year
   ago, and as the quantity increases the value of them will diminish. This
   gives the appearance of things being dear when they are not so in fact,
   for in the same proportion that any kind of money falls in value articles
   rise in price. If it were not for this the quantity of assignats would be
   too great to be circulated. Paper money in America fell so much in value
   from this excessive quantity of it, that in the year 1781 I gave three
   hundred paper dollars for one pair of worsted stockings. What I write you
   upon the subject is experience, and not merely opinion. I have no personal
   interest in any of these matters, nor in any party disputes. I attend only
   to general principles.

   As soon as a constitution shall be established I shall return to America;
   and be the future prosperity of France ever so great, I shall enjoy no
   other part of it than the happiness of knowing it. In the meantime I am
   distressed to see matters so badly conducted, and so little attention paid
   to moral principles. It is these things that injure the character of the
   Revolution and discourage the progress of liberty all over the world. When
   I began this letter I did not intend making it so lengthy, but since I
   have gone thus far I will fill up, the remainder of the sheet with such
   matters as occur to me.

   There ought to be some regulation with respect to the spirit of
   denunciation that now prevails. If every individual is to indulge his
   private malignancy or his private ambition, to denounce at random and
   without any kind of proof, all confidence will be undermined and all
   authority be destroyed. Calumny is a species of treachery that ought to be
   punished as well as any other kind of treachery. It is a private vice
   productive of public evils; because it is possible to irritate men into
   disaffection by continual calumny who never intended to be disaffected.

   It is therefore equally as necessary to guard against the evils of
   unfounded or malignant suspicion as against the evils of blind confidence.
   It is equally as necessary to protect the characters of public officers
   from calumny as it is to punish them for treachery or misconduct. For my
   own part I shall hold it a matter of doubt, until better evidence arises
   than is known at present, whether Dumouriez has been a traitor from policy
   or resentment. There was certainly a time when he acted well, but it is
   not every man whose mind is strong enough to bear up against ingratitude,
   and I think he experienced a great deal of this before he revolted.

   Calumny becomes harmless and defeats itself when it attempts to act upon
   too large a scale. Thus the denunciation of the sections [of Paris]
   against the twenty-two deputies [Girondists] falls to the ground. The
   departments that elected them are better judges of their moral and
   political characters than those who have denounced them. This denunciation
   will injure Paris in the opinion of the departments because it has the
   appearance of dictating to them what sort of deputies they shall elect.
   Most of the acquaintances that I have in the Convention are among those
   who are in that list, and I know there are not better men nor better
   patriots than what they are.

   I have written a letter to Marat of the same date as this but not on the
   same subject. He may show it to you if he choose.

   Votre Ami,

   THOMAS PAINE.
