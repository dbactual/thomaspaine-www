   DISSERTATION ON FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT



   Philip Foner's introduction:

   In 1795 Paine was readmitted to the French National Convention, and again
   he began to use his pen to clarify certain basic political issues arising
   in Europe. This pamphlet, published in Paris early in July, 1795, was
   originally written for distribution in Holland where Paine's Rights of Man
   was not very well known. But it was also used in France in connection with
   the discussion in the French National Convention on the Constitution of
   1795. Paine objected to several features in the proposed Constitution,
   especially its restrictions on universal manhood suffrage. He makes his
   position clear in this pamphlet when he writes: "The right of voting for
   representatives is the primary right by which other rights are protected.
   To take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery, for slavery
   consists in being subject to the will of another, and he that has not a
   vote in the election of representatives is in this case." Paine also lays
   stress in this pamphlet on his belief that the "moral principle of
   revolutions is to instruct, not to destroy."

   ***

   THERE is no subject more interesting to every man than the subject of
   government. His security, be he rich or poor, and in a great measure his
   prosperity, are connected therewith; it is therefore his interest as well
   as his duty to make himself acquainted with its principles, and what the
   practise ought to be.

   Every art and science, however imperfectly known at first, has been
   studied, improved and brought to what we call perfection by the
   progressive labors of succeeding generations; but the science of
   government has stood still. No improvement has been made in the principle
   and scarcely any in the practise till the American Revolution began. In
   all the countries of Europe (except in France) the same forms and systems
   that were erected in the remote ages of ignorance still continue, and
   their antiquity is put in the place of principle; it is forbidden to
   investigate their origin, or by what right they exist. If it be asked how
   has this happened, the answer is easy: they are established on a principle
   that is false, and they employ their power to prevent detection.

   Notwithstanding the mystery with which the science of government has been
   enveloped, for the purpose of enslaving, plundering and imposing upon
   mankind, it is of all things the least mysterious and the most easy to be
   understood. The meanest capacity cannot be at a loss, if it begins its
   inquiries at the right point. Every art and science has some point, or
   alphabet, at which the study of that art or science begins, and by the
   assistance of which the progress is facilitated. The same method ought to
   be observed with respect to the science of government.

   Instead then of embarrassing the subject in the outset with the numerous
   subdivisions under which different forms of government have been classed,
   such as aristocracy, democracy, oligarchy, monarchy, etc., the better
   method will be to begin with what may be called primary divisions, or
   those under which all the several subdivisions will be comprehended.

   The primary divisions are but two:

   First, government by election and representation.

   Secondly, government by hereditary succession.

   All the several forms and systems of government, however numerous or
   diversified, class themselves under one or other of those primary
   divisions; for either they are on the system of representation, or on that
   of hereditary succession. As to that equivocal thing called mixed
   government, such as the late Government of Holland, and the present
   Government of England, it does not make an exception to the general rule,
   because the parts separately considered are either representative or
   hereditary.

   Beginning then our inquiries at this point, we have first to examine into
   the nature of those two primary divisions. If they are equally right in
   principle, it is mere matter of opinion which we prefer. If the one be
   demonstratively better than the other that difference directs our choice;
   but if one of them should be so absolutely false as not to have a right of
   existence the matter settles itself at once; because a negative proved on
   one thing, where two only are offered, and one must be accepted, amounts
   to an affirmative on the other.

   The revolutions that are now spreading themselves in the world have their
   origin in this state of the case, and the present war is a conflict
   between the representative system founded on the rights of the people, and
   the hereditary system founded in usurpation. As to what are called
   monarchy, royalty and aristocracy, they do not, either as things or as
   terms, sufficiently describe the hereditary system; they are but secondary
   things or signs of the hereditary system, and which fall of themselves if
   that system has not a right to exist.

   Were there no such terms as monarchy, royalty and aristocracy, or were
   other terms substituted in their place, the hereditary system, if it
   continued, would not be altered thereby. It would be the same system under
   any other titulary name as it is now.

   The character therefore of the revolutions of the present day
   distinguishes itself most definitely by grounding itself on the system of
   representative government, in opposition to the hereditary. No other
   distinction reaches the whole of the principle.

   Having thus opened the case generally, I proceed, in the first place, to
   examine the hereditary system because it has the priority in point of
   time. The representative system is the invention of the modern world; and,
   that no doubt may arise as to my own opinion, I declare it before- hand,
   which is, that there is not a problem in Euclid more mathematically true
   than that hereditary government has not a right to exist. When therefore
   we take from any man the exercise of hereditary power we take away that
   which he never had the right to possess, and which no law or custom could,
   or ever can, give him a title to.

   The arguments that have hitherto been employed against the hereditary
   system have been chiefly founded upon the absurdity of it, and its
   incompetency to the purpose of good government. Nothing can present to our
   judgment, or to our imagination, a figure of greater absurdity, than that
   of seeing the government of a nation fall, as it frequently does, into the
   hands of a lad necessarily destitute of experience, and often little
   better than a fool. It is an insult to every man of years, of character,
   and of talents, in a country.

   The moment we begin to reason upon the hereditary system, it falls into
   derision; let but a single idea begin and a thousand will soon follow.
   Insignificance, imbecility, childhood, dotage, want of moral character; in
   fine, every defect, serious or laughable, unite to hold up the hereditary
   system as a figure of ridicule. Leaving, however, the ridiculousness of
   the thing to the reflections of the reader, I proceed to the more
   important part of the question, namely, whether such a system has a right
   to exist.

   To be satisfied of the right of a thing to exist, we must be satisfied
   that it had a right to begin. If it had not a right to begin, it has not
   the right to continue. By what right then did the hereditary system begin?
   Let a man but ask himself this question, and he will find that he cannot
   satisfy himself with an answer.

   The right which any man or any family had to set itself up at first to
   govern a nation, and to establish itself hereditarily, was no other than
   the right which Robespierre had to do the same thing in France. If he had
   none, they had none. If they had any, he had as much; for it is impossible
   to discover superiority of right in any family, by virtue of which
   hereditary government could begin. The Capets, the Guelphs, the
   Robespierres, the Marats, are all on the same standing as to the question
   of right. It belongs exclusively to none.

   It is one step toward liberty to perceive that hereditary government could
   not begin as an exclusive right in any family. The next point will be
   whether, having once begun, it could grow into a right by the influence of
   time.

   This would be supposing an absurdity; for either it is putting time in the
   place of principle, or making it superior to principle; whereas time has
   no more connection with, or influence upon principle, than principle has
   upon time. The wrong which began a thousand years ago is as much a wrong
   as if it began to-day; and the right which originates to-day is as much a
   right as if it had the sanction of a thousand years.

   Time with respect to principles is an eternal NOW : it has no operation
   upon them: it changes nothing of their nature and qualities. But what have
   we to do with a thousand years ? Our lifetime is but a short portion of
   that period, and if we find the wrong in existence as soon as we begin to
   live, that is the point of time at which it begins to us; and our right to
   resist it is the same as if it never existed before.

   As hereditary government could not begin as a natural right in any family,
   nor derive after its commencement any right from time, we have only to
   examine whether there exist in a nation a right to set it up, and
   establish it by what is called law, as has been done in England. I answer
   NO; and that any law or any constitution made for that purpose is an act
   of treason against the right of every minor in the nation, at the time it
   is made, and against the rights of all succeeding generations.

   I shall speak upon each of those cases. First, of the minor at the time
   such law is made. Secondly, of the generations that are to follow.

   A nation, in a collective sense, comprehends all the individuals of
   whatever age, from just born to just dying. Of these, one part will be
   minors and the other aged. The average of life is not exactly the same in
   every climate and country, but in general the minority in years are the
   majority in numbers; that is, the number of persons under twenty-one
   years, is greater than the number of persons above that age.

   This difference in number is not necessary to the establishment of the
   principle I mean to lay down, but it serves to show the justice of it more
   strongly. The principle would be equally as good if the majority in years
   were also the majority in numbers.

   The rights of minors are as sacred as the rights of the aged. The
   difference is altogether in the different age of the two parties, and
   nothing in the nature of the rights; the rights are the same rights; and
   are to be preserved inviolate for the inheritance of the minors when they
   shall come of age. During the minority of minors their rights are under
   the sacred guardianship of the aged.

   The minor cannot surrender them; the guardian cannot dispossess him;
   consequently, the aged part of a nation, who are the law-makers for the
   time being, and who, in the march of life are but a few years ahead of
   those who are yet minors, and to whom they must shortly give place, have
   not and cannot have the right to make a law to set up and establish
   hereditary government, or, to speak more distinctly, an hereditary
   succession of governors; because it is an attempt to deprive every minor
   in the nation, at the time such a law is made, of his inheritance of
   rights when he shall come of age, and to subjugate him to a system of
   government to which, during his minority, he could neither consent nor
   object.

   If a person who is a minor at the time such a law is proposed, had
   happened to have been born a few years sooner, so as to be of the age of
   twenty-one years at the time of proposing it, his right to have objected
   against it, to have exposed the injustice and tyrannical principles of it
   and to have voted against it, will be admitted on all sides.

   If, therefore, the law operates to prevent his exercising the same rights
   after he comes of age as he would have had a right to exercise had he been
   of age at the time, it is undeniably a law to take away and annul the
   rights of every person in the nation who shall be a minor at the time of
   making such a law, and consequently the right to make it cannot exist.

   I come now to speak of government by hereditary succession, as it applies
   to succeeding generations; and to show that in this case, as in the case
   of minors, there does not exit in a nation a right to set it up.

   A nation, though continually existing, is continually in a state of
   renewal and succession. It is never stationary. Every day produces new
   births, carries minors forward to maturity, and old persons from the
   stage. In this ever running flood of generations there is no part superior
   in authority to another. Could we conceive an idea of superiority in any,
   at what point of time, or in what century of the world, are we to fix it ?
   To what cause are we to ascribe it? By what evidence are we to prove it?
   By what criterion are we to know it?

   A single reflection will teach us that our ancestors, like ourselves, were
   but tenants for life in the great freehold of rights. The fee-absolute was
   not in them, it is not in us, it belongs to the whole family of man
   through all ages. If we think otherwise than this we think either as
   slaves or as tyrants. As slaves, if we think that any former generation
   had a right to bind us; as tyrants, if we think that we have authority to
   bind the generations that are to follow.

   It may not be inapplicable to the subject, to endeavor to define what is
   to be understood by a generation in the sense the word is here used.

   As a natural term its meaning is sufficiently clear. The father, the son,
   the grandson, are so many distinct generations. But when we speak of a
   generation as describing the persons in whom legal authority resides, as
   distinct from another generation of the same description who are to
   succeed them, it comprehends all those who are above the age of twenty-one
   years, at the time that we count from; and a generation of this kind will
   continue in authority between fourteen and twenty-one years, that is,
   until the number of minors, who shall have arrived at age, shall be
   greater than the number of persons remaining of the former stock.

   For example: If France, at this or any other moment, contains twenty-four
   millions of souls, twelve millions will be males, and twelve females. Of
   the twelve millions of males, six millions will be of the age of
   twenty-one years, and six will be under, and the authority to govern will
   reside in the first six.

   But every day will make some alteration, and in twenty-one years every one
   of those minors who survives will have arrived at age, and the greater
   part of the former stock will be gone: the majority of persons then
   living, in whom the legal authority resides, will be composed of those
   who, twenty-one years before, had no legal existence. Those will be
   fathers and grandfathers in their turn, and, in the next twenty-one years
   (or less) another race of minors, arrived at age, will succeed them, and
   so on.

   As this is ever the case, and as every generation is equal in rights to
   another, it consequently follows, that there cannot be a right in any to
   establish government by hereditary succession, because it would be
   supposing itself possessed of a right superior to the rest, namely, that
   of commanding by its own authority how the world shall be hereafter
   governed, and who shall govern it.

   Every age and generation is, and must be (as a matter of right), as free
   to act for itself in all cases, as the age and generation that preceded
   it. The vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave is the most
   ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies. Man has no property in man,
   neither has one generation a property in the generations that are to
   follow.

   In the first part of the "Rights of Man" I have spoken of government by
   hereditary succession; and I will here close the subject with an extract
   from that work, which states it under the two following heads.

   The history of the English Parliament furnishes an example of this kind;
   and which merits to be recorded as being the greatest instance of
   legislative ignorance and want of principle that is to be found in any
   country. The case is as follows:

   The English Parliament of 1688, imported a man and his wife from Holland,
   William and Mary, and made them King and Queen of England. Having done
   this, the said Parliament made a law to convey the government of the
   country to the heirs of William and Mary, in the following words: "We, the
   Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, do, in the name of the people
   of England, most humbly and faithfully submit ourselves, our heirs and
   posterities, to William and Mary, their heirs and posterities, forever."
   And in a subsequent law, as quoted by Edmund Burke, the said Parliament,
   in the name of the people of England then living, binds the said people,
   their heirs and posterities, to William and Mary, their heirs and
   posterities, to the end of time.

   It is not sufficient that we laugh at the ignorance of such law-makers; it
   is necessary that we reprobate their want of principle. The Constituent
   Assembly of France, 1789, fell into the same vice as the Parliament of
   England had done, and assumed to establish an hereditary succession in the
   family of the Capets as an act of the Constitution of that year.

   That every nation, for the time being, has a right to govern itself as it
   pleases, must always be admitted; but government by hereditary succession
   is government for another race of people, and not for itself; and as those
   on whom it is to operate are not yet in existence, or are minors, so
   neither is the right in existence to set it up for them, and to assume
   such a right is treason against the right of posterity.

   I here close the arguments on the first head, that of government by
   hereditary succession; and proceed to the second, that of government by
   election and representation; or, as it may be concisely expressed,
   representative government, in contradistinction to hereditary government.

   Reasoning by exclusion, if hereditary government has not a right to exist,
   and that it has not is provable, representative government is admitted of
   course.

   In contemplating government by election and representation, we amuse not
   ourselves in inquiring when or how, or by what right, it began. Its origin
   is ever in view. Man is himself the origin and the evidence of the right.
   It appertains to him in right of his existence, and his person is the
   title deed.

   The true and only true basis of representative government is equality of
   rights. Every man has a right to one vote, and no more in the choice of
   representatives. The rich have no more right to exclude the poor from the
   right of voting, or of electing and being elected, than the poor have to
   exclude the rich; and wherever it is attempted, or proposed, on either
   side, it is a question of force and not of right. Who is he that would
   exclude another? That other has a right to exclude him.

   That which is now called aristocracy implies an inequality of rights; but
   who are the persons that have a right to establish this inequality? Will
   the rich exclude themselves? No. Will the poor exclude themselves? No. By
   what right then can any be excluded? It would be a question, if any man or
   class of men have a right to exclude themselves; but, be this as it may,
   they cannot have the right to exclude another. The poor will not delegate
   such a right to the rich, nor the rich to the poor, and to assume it is
   not only to assume arbitrary power, but to assume a right to commit
   robbery.

   Personal rights, of which the right of voting for representatives is one,
   are a species of property of the most sacred kind: and he that would
   employ his pecuniary property, or presume upon the influence it gives him,
   to dispossess or rob another of his property or rights, uses that
   pecuniary property as he would use fire-arms, and merits to have it taken
   from him.

   Inequality of rights is created by a combination in one part of the
   community to exclude another part from its rights. Whenever it be made an
   article of a constitution, or a law, that the right of voting, or of
   electing and being elected, shall appertain exclusively to persons
   possessing a certain quantity of property, be it little or much, it is a
   combination of the persons possessing that quantity to exclude those who
   do not possess the same quantity. It is investing themselves with powers
   as a self-created part of society, to the exclusion of the rest.

   It is always to be taken for granted, that those who oppose an equality of
   rights never mean the exclusion should take place on themselves; and in
   this view of the case, pardoning the vanity of the thing, aristocracy is a
   subject of laughter. This self-soothing vanity is encouraged by another
   idea not less selfish, which is that the opposers conceive they are
   playing a safe game, in which there is a chance to gain and none to lose;
   that at any rate the doctrine of equality includes them, and that if they
   cannot get more rights than those whom they oppose and would exclude they
   shall not have less.

   This opinion has already been fatal to thousands, who, not contented with
   equal rights, have sought more till they lost all, and experienced in
   themselves the degrading inequality they endeavored to fix upon others.

   In any view of the case it is dangerous and impolitic, sometimes
   ridiculous, and always unjust to make property the criterion of the right
   of voting. If the sum or value of the property upon which the right is to
   take place be considerable it will exclude a majority of the people and
   unite them in a common interest against the government and against those
   who support it; and as the power is always with the majority, they can
   overturn such a government and its supporters whenever they please.

   If, in order to avoid this danger, a small quantity of property be fixed,
   as the criterion of the right, it exhibits liberty in disgrace, by putting
   it in competition with accident and insignificance. When a broodmare shall
   fortunately produce a foal or a mule that, by being worth the sum in
   question, shall convey to its owner the right of voting, or by its death
   take it from him, in whom does the origin of such a right exist? Is it in
   the man, or in the mule? When we consider how many ways property may be
   acquired without merit, and lost without crime, we ought to spurn the idea
   of making it a criterion of rights.

   But the offensive part of the case is that this exclusion from the right
   of voting implies a stigma on the moral character of the persons excluded;
   and this is what no part of the community has a right to pronounce upon
   another part. No external circumstance can justify it: wealth is no proof
   of moral character; nor poverty of the want of it.

   On the contrary, wealth is often the presumptive evidence of dishonesty;
   and poverty the negative evidence of innocence. If therefore property,
   whether little or much, be made a criterion, the means by which that
   property has been acquired ought to be made a criterion also.

   The only ground upon which exclusion from the right of voting is
   consistent with justice would be to inflict it as a punishment for a
   certain time upon those who should propose to take away that right from
   others. The right of voting for representatives is the primary right by
   which other rights are protected.

   To take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery, for slavery
   consists in being subject to the will of another, and he that has not a
   vote in the election of representatives is in this case. The proposal
   therefore to disfranchise any class of men is as criminal as the proposal
   to take away property.

   When we speak of right we ought always to unite with it the idea of
   duties: rights become duties by reciprocity. The right which I enjoy
   becomes my duty to guarantee it to another, and he to me; and those who
   violate the duty justly incur a forfeiture of the right.

   In a political view of the case, the strength and permanent security of
   government is in proportion to the number of people interested in
   supporting it. The true policy therefore is to interest the whole by an
   equality of rights, for the danger arises from exclusions. It is possible
   to exclude men from the right of voting, but it is impossible to exclude
   them from the right of rebelling against that exclusion; and when all
   other rights are taken away the right of rebellion is made perfect.

   While men could be persuaded they had no rights, or that rights
   appertained only to a certain class of men, or that government was a thing
   existing in right of itself, it was not difficult to govern them
   authoritatively. The ignorance in which they were held, and the
   superstition in which they were instructed, furnished the means of doing
   it.

   But when the ignorance is gone, and the superstition with it; when they
   perceive the imposition that has been acted upon them; when they reflect
   that the cultivator and the manufacturer are the primary means of all the
   wealth that exists in the world, beyond what nature spontaneously
   produces; when they begin to feel their consequences by their usefulness,
   and their right as members of society, it is then no longer possible to
   govern them as before. The fraud once detected cannot be re-acted. To
   attempt it is to provoke derision, or invite destruction.

   That property will ever be unequal is certain. Industry, superiority of
   talents, dexterity of management, extreme frugality, fortunate
   opportunities, or the opposite, or the means of those things, will ever
   produce that effect, without having recourse to the harsh, ill-sounding
   names of avarice and oppression; and besides this there are some men who,
   though they do not despise wealth, will not stoop to the drudgery or the
   means of acquiring it, nor will be troubled with it beyond their wants or
   their independence; while in others there is an avidity to obtain it by
   every means not punishable; it makes the sole business of their lives, and
   they follow it as a religion. All that is required with respect to
   property is to obtain it honestly, arid not employ it criminally; but it
   is always criminally employed when it is made a criterion for exclusive
   rights.

   In institutions that are purely pecuniary, such as that of a bank or a
   commercial company, the rights of the members composing that company are
   wholly created by the property they invest therein; and no other rights
   are represented in the government of that company than what arise out of
   that property; neither has that government cognizance of anything but
   property.

   But the case is totally different with respect to the institution of civil
   government, organized on the system of representation. Such a government
   has cognizance of everything, and of every man as a member of the national
   society, whether he has property or not; and, therefore, the principle
   requires that every man, and every kind of right, be represented, of which
   the right to acquire and to hold property is but one, and that not of the
   most essential kind.

   The protection of a man's person is more sacred than the protection of
   property; and besides this, the faculty of performing any kind of work or
   services by which he acquires a livelihood, or maintaining his family, is
   of the nature of property. It is property to him; he has acquired it; and
   it is as much the object of his protection as exterior property, possessed
   without that faculty, can be the object of protection in another person.

   I have always believed that the best security for property, be it much or
   little, is to remove from every part of the community, as far as can
   possibly be done, every cause of complaint, and every motive to violence;
   and this can only be done by an equality of rights. When rights are
   secure, property is secure in consequence. But when property is made a
   pretense for unequal or exclusive rights, it weakens the right to hold the
   property, and provokes indignation and tumult; for it is unnatural to
   believe that property can be secure under the guarantee of a society
   injured in its rights by the influence of that property.

   Next to the injustice and ill-policy of making property a pretense for
   exclusive rights, is the unaccountable absurdity of giving to mere sound
   the idea of property, and annexing to it certain rights; for what else is
   a title but sound ? Nature is often giving to the world some extraordinary
   men who arrive at fame by merit and universal consent, such as Aristotle,
   Socrates, Plato, etc. They were truly great or noble. But when government
   sets up a manufactory of nobles, it is as absurd as if she undertook to
   manufacture wise men. Her nobles are all counterfeits.

   This wax-work order has assumed the name of aristocracy; and the disgrace
   of it would be lessened if it could be considered only as childish
   imbecility. We pardon foppery because of its insignificance, and on the
   same ground we might pardon the foppery of titles. But the origin of
   aristocracy was worse than foppery. It was robbery. The first aristocrats
   in all countries were brigands. Those of later times, sycophants.

   It is very well known that in England (and the same will be found in other
   countries), the great landed estates now held in descent were plundered
   from the quiet inhabitants at the Conquest. The possibility did not exist
   of acquiring such estates honestly. If it be asked how they could have
   been acquired, no answer but that of robbery can be given. That they were
   not acquired by trade, by commerce, by manufactures, by agriculture, or by
   any reputable employment, is certain.

   How then were they acquired ? Blush, aristocracy, to hear your origin, for
   your progenitors were thieves. They were the Robespierres and the Jacobins
   of that day. When they had committed the robbery, they endeavored to lose
   the disgrace of it by sinking their real names under fictitious ones,
   which they called titles. It is ever the practise of felons to act in this
   manner. They never pass by their real names.

   As property, honestly obtained, is best secured by an equality of rights,
   so ill-gotten property depends for protection on a monopoly of rights. He
   who has robbed another of his property, will next endeavor to disarm him
   of his rights, to secure that property; for when the robber becomes the
   legislator he believes himself secure. That part of the Government of
   England that is called the House of Lords, was originally composed of
   persons who had committed the robberies of which I have been speaking. It
   was an association for the protection of the property they had stolen.

   But besides the criminality of the origin of aristocracy, it has an
   injurious effect on the moral and physical character of man. Like slavery
   it debilitates the human faculties; for as the mind bowed down by slavery
   loses in silence its elastic powers, so, in the contrary extreme, when it
   is buoyed up by folly, it becomes incapable of exerting them, and dwindles
   into imbecility. It is impossible that a mind employed upon ribands and
   titles can ever be great. The childishness of the objects consumes the
   man.

   It is at all times necessary, and more particularly so during the progress
   of a revolution, and until right ideas confirm themselves by habit, that
   we frequently refresh our patriotism by reference to first principles. It
   is by tracing things to their origin that we learn to understand them: and
   it is by keeping that line and that origin always in view that we never
   forget them.

   An inquiry into the origin of rights will demonstrate to us that rights
   are not gifts from one man to another, nor from one class of men to
   another; for who is he who could be the first giver, or by what principle,
   or on what authority, could he possess the right of giving?

   A declaration of rights is not a creation of them, nor a donation of them.
   It is a manifest of the principle by which they exist, followed by a
   detail of what the rights are; for every civil right has a natural right
   for its foundation, and it includes the principle of a reciprocal
   guarantee of those rights from man to man. As, therefore, it is impossible
   to discover any origin of rights otherwise than in the origin of man, it
   consequently follows, that rights appertain to man in right of his
   existence only, and must therefore be equal to every man.

   The principle of an equality of rights is clear and simple. Every man can
   understand it, and it is by understanding his rights that he learns his
   duties; for where the rights of men are equal, every man must finally see
   the necessity of protecting the rights of others as the most effectual
   security for his own.

   But if, in the formation of a constitution, we depart from the principle
   of equal rights, or attempt any modification of it, we plunge into a
   labyrinth of difficulties from which there is no way out but by
   retreating. Where are we to stop? Or by what principle are we to find out
   the point to stop at, that shall discriminate between men of the same
   country, part of whom shall be free, and the rest not?

   If property is to be made the criterion, it is a total departure from
   every moral principle of liberty, because it is attaching rights to mere
   matter, and making man the agent of that matter. It is, moreover, holding
   up property as an apple of discord, and not only exciting but justifying
   war against it; for I maintain the principle, that when property is used
   as an instrument to take away the rights of those who may happen not to
   possess property, it is used to an unlawful purpose, as firearms would be
   in a similar case.

   In a state of nature all men are equal in rights, but they are not equal
   in power; the weak cannot protect themselves against the strong. This
   being the case, the institution of civil society is for the purpose of
   .making an equalization of powers that shall be parallel to, and a
   guarantee of, the equality of rights. The laws of a country, when properly
   constructed, apply to this purpose.

   Every man takes the arm of the law for his protection as more effectual
   than his own; and therefore every man has an equal right in the formation
   of the government, and of the laws by which he is to be governed and
   judged. In extensive countries and societies, such as America and France,
   this right in the individual can only be exercised by delegation, that is,
   by election and representation; and hence it is that the institution of
   representative government arises.

   Hitherto, I have confined myself to matters of principle only. First, that
   hereditary government has not a right to exist; that it cannot be
   established on any principle of right; and that it is a violation of all
   principle. Secondly, that government by election and representation has
   its origin in the natural and eternal rights of man; for whether a man be
   his own lawgiver, as he would be in a state of nature; or whether he
   exercises his portion of legislative sovereignty in his own person, as
   might be the case in small democracies where all could assemble for the
   formation of the laws by which they were to be governed; or whether he
   exercises it in the choice of persons to represent him in a national
   assembly of representatives, the origin of the right is the same in all
   cases. The first, as is before observed, is defective in power; the
   second, is practicable only in democracies of small extent; the third, is
   the greatest scale upon which human government can be instituted.

   Next to matters of principle are matters of opinion, and it is necessary
   to distinguish between the two. Whether the rights of men shall be equal
   is not a matter of opinion but of right, and consequently of principle;
   for men do not hold their rights as grants from each other, but each one
   in right of himself. Society is the guardian but not the giver. And as in
   extensive societies, such as America and France, the right of the
   individual in matters of government cannot be exercised but by election
   and representation, it consequently follows that the only system of
   government consistent with principle, where simple democracy is
   impracticable, is the representative system.

   But as to the organical part, or the manner in which the several parts of
   government shall be arranged and composed, it is altogether matter of
   opinion. It is necessary that all the parts be conformable with the
   principle of equal rights; and so long as this principle be religiously
   adhered to, no very material error can take place, neither can any error
   continue long in that part which falls within the province of opinion.

   In all matters of opinion, the social compact, or the principle by which
   society is held together, requires that the majority of opinions becomes
   the rule for the whole, and that the minority yields practical obedience
   thereto. This is perfectly conformable to the principle of equal rights:
   for, in the first place, every man has a right to give an opinion but no
   man has a right that his opinion should govern the rest. In the second
   place, it is not supposed to be known beforehand on which side of any
   question, whether for or against, any man's opinion will fall. He may
   happen to be in a majority upon some questions, and in a minority upon
   others; and by the same rule that he expects obedience in the one case, he
   must yield it in the other.

   All the disorders that have arisen in France during the progress of the
   Revolution have had their origin, not in the principle of equal rights,
   but in the violation of that principle. The principle of equal rights has
   been repeatedly violated, and that not by the majority but by the
   minority, and that minority has been composed of men possessing property,
   as well as of men without property; property, therefore, even upon the
   experience already had, is no more a criterion of character than it is of
   rights.

   It will sometimes happen that the minority are right, and the majority are
   wrong, but as soon as experience proves this to be the case, the minority
   will increase to a majority, and the error will reform itself by the
   tranquil operation of freedom of opinion and equality of rights. Nothing,
   therefore, can justify an insurrection, neither can it ever be necessary
   where rights are equal and opinions free.

   Taking then the principle of equal rights as the foundation of the
   Revolution, and consequently of the Constitution, the organical part, or
   the manner in which the several parts of the Government shall be arranged
   in the Constitution, will, as is already said, fall within the province of
   opinion.

   Various methods will present themselves upon a question of this kind, and
   though experience is yet wanting to determine which is the best, it has, I
   think, sufficiently decided which is the worst. That is the worst, which
   in its deliberations and decisions is subject to the precipitancy and
   passion of an individual; and when the whole legislature is crowded into
   one body it is an individual in mass. In all cases of deliberation it is
   necessary to have a corps of reserve, and it would be better to divide the
   representation by lot into two parts, and let them revise and correct each
   other, than that the whole should sit together, and debate at once.

   Representative government is not necessarily confined to any one
   particular form. The principle is the same in all the forms under which it
   can be arranged. The equal rights of the people is the root from which the
   whole springs, and the branches may be arranged as present opinion or
   future experience shall best direct. As to that hospital of incurables (as
   Chesterfield calls it), the British House of Peers, it is an excrescence
   growing out of corruption; and there is no more affinity or resemblance
   between any of the branches of a legislative body originating from the
   right of the people, and the aforesaid House of Peers, than between a
   regular member of the human body and an ulcerated wen.

   As to that part of government that is called the executive, it is
   necessary in the first place to fix a precise meaning to the word.

   There are but two divisions into which power can be arranged. First, that
   of willing or decreeing the laws; secondly, that of executing or putting
   them in practise. The former corresponds to the intellectual faculties of
   the human mind which reasons and determines what shall be done; the
   second, to the mechanical powers of the human body that puts that
   determination into practise.

   If the former decides, and the latter does not perform, it is a state of
   imbecility; and if the latter acts without the predetermination of the
   former, it is a state of lunacy. The executive department therefore is
   official, and is subordinate to the legislative, as the body is to the
   mind in a state of health; for it is impossible to conceive the idea of
   two sovereignties, a sovereignty to will and a sovereignty to act.

   The executive is not invested with the power of deliberating whether it
   shall act or not; it has no discretionary authority in the case; for it
   can act no other thing than what the laws decree, and it is obliged to act
   conformably thereto; and in this view of the case the executive is made up

   of all the official departments that execute the laws, of which that which
   is called the judiciary is the chief.

   But mankind have conceived an idea that some kind of authority is
   necessary to superintend the execution of the laws and to see that they
   are faithfully performed; and it is by confounding this superintending
   authority with the official execution that we get embarrassed about the
   term executive power. All the parts in the governments of the United
   States of America that are called THE EXECUTIVE, are no other than
   authorities to superintend the execution of the laws; and they are so far
   independent of the legislative that they know the legislative only through
   the laws, and cannot be controlled or directed by it through any other
   medium.

   In what manner this superintending authority shall be appointed, or
   composed, is a matter that falls within the province of opinion. Some may
   prefer one method and some another; and in all cases, where opinion only
   and not principle is concerned, the majority of opinions

   forms the rule for all.

   There are however some things deducible from reason, and evidenced by
   experience, that serve to guide our decision upon the case. The one is
   never to invest any individual with extraordinary power; for besides his
   being tempted to misuse it, it will excite contention and commotion in the
   nation for the office. Secondly, never to invest power long in the hands
   of any number of individuals. The inconveniences that may be supposed to
   accompany frequent changes are less to be feared than the danger that
   arises from long continuance.

   I shall conclude this discourse with offering some observations on the
   means of preserving liberty; for it is not only necessary that we
   establish it, but that we preserve it.

   It is, in the first place, necessary that we distinguish between the means
   made use of to overthrow despotism, in order to prepare the way for the
   establishment of liberty, and the means to be used after the despotism is
   overthrown.

   The means made use of in the first case are justified by necessity. Those
   means are, in general, insurrections; for while the established government
   of despotism continues in any country it is scarcely possible that any
   other means can be used. It is also certain that in the commencement of a
   revolution, the revolutionary party permit to themselves a discretionary
   exercise of power regulated more by circumstances than by principle,
   which, were the practise to continue, liberty would never be established,
   or if established would soon be overthrown. It is never to be expected in
   a revolution that every man is to change his opinion at the same moment.

   There never yet was any truth or any principle so irresistibly obvious
   that all men believed it at once. Time and reason must cooperate with each
   other to the final establishment of any principle; and therefore those who
   may happen to be first convinced have not a right to persecute others, on
   whom conviction operates more slowly. The moral principle of revolutions
   is to instruct, not to destroy.

   Had a constitution been established two years ago (as ought to have been
   done), the violences that have since desolated France and injured the
   character of the Revolution, would, in my opinion, have been prevented.
   The nation would then have had a bond of union, and every individual would
   have known the line of conduct he was to follow. But, instead of this, a
   revolutionary government, a thing without either principle or authority,
   was substituted in its place; virtue and crime depended upon accident; and
   that which was patriotism one day be-

   came treason the next.

   All these things have followed from the want of a constitution; for it is
   the nature and intention of a constitution to prevent governing by party,
   by establishing a common principle that shall limit and control the power
   and impulse of party, and that says to all parties, thus far shalt thou go
   and no further. But in the absence of a constitution, men look entirely to
   party; and instead of principle governing party, party governs principle.

   An avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty. It leads men to
   stretch, to misinterpret, and to misapply even the best of laws. He that
   would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from
   oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that
   will

   reach to himself.
