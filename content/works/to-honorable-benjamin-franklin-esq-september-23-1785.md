   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.

   New-York Sept 23d, 1785

   My Dear Sir

   It gives me exceeding great pleasure to have the opportunity of
   Congratulating you on your return home and to a land of Peace; and to
   express to you my heart-felt wishes that the remainder of your days may be
   to you a time of happy ease and rest.

   Should fate prolong my life to the extent of yours, it would give me the
   greatest felicity to have the evening Scene some resemblance of what you
   now enjoy.

   In making you this address, I have an additional pleasure in reflecting
   that so far as I have hitherto gone I am not conscious of any Circumstance
   in my own conduct, that should give you one repentant thought for being my
   Patron and Introducer to America.

   It would give me great Pleasure to make a journey to Philadelphia on
   purpose to see you, but an interesting Affair I have with Congress makes
   my absence at this time improper.

   If you have time to let me know how your health is, I shall be much
   obliged to you. &mdash; I am &mdash; Dear Sir, with the sincerest 
   Affection and Respect 
   
   Your Obedient Humble Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
   
   My address is Mssrs Lawrence and Morris Merchants N York
