Title: To a Committee of the Continental Congress October, 1783

   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Having understood that a report of the Committee, to whom a late
   application of mine, to Congress, was referred, is now before that
   Honorable Body, I am desirous, before the report be further gone into, to
   lay before the Committee some matters relative to myself, which I presume
   may not be inconvenient for them to know, &mdash; and likewise to offer such
   remarks on the subject of the report, which (I am distantly informed, for
   I have not seen it) is, that I be appointed Historiographer to the
   Continent, as appears to me necessary to elucidate an appointment so
   exceedingly nice on the part of Congress and so critical and difficult on
   the part of myself.

   In thus looking back and bringing into my own view the many trying and
   inconvenient situations I have passed over for several years, I may very
   probably feel something of that unpleasantness of reflection which cannot
   fail to arise, when I compare what my unvaried conduct and disposition
   towards the Cause of America has been, and what hers has been to me in
   return.

   As the last instance of regard to a Country, which, collectively had shewn
   so little to me, and from an affection to those principles of freedom, on
   which the Cause of America was founded, and as a justification to my own
   mind for whatever I might hereafter think or say, respecting her public
   spirit to me, or mine to her, I presented a Letter to Congress of ___ 
   requesting that Congress would be pleased to direct me to lay before
   them an account of what my services, such as they are, have been, the
   manner in which they were performed, and the situation I had been cast
   into during the course of the war. &mdash; For as I saw little more than a
   prospect of future inconveniences to arise to myself by continuing in
   America, and as my return to Europe where I am not, and cannot now pass
   unknown, and the inconvenient circumstances under which that return must
   have been made would eventually have suggested an idea that either I had
   been unworthy of the regard of America, notwithstanding the appearance
   of service, or that she had been remiss in her regard towards me. I was
   therefore desirous of placing matters in such an unambiguous light before
   Congress, that my departure from a Country that did not afford me a home
   might, under any circumstance whatever, stand (should there be any
   occasion for it) as open and visible as every other part of my conduct
   had done. &mdash; For to me who have often reflected upon it, it appears, that the
   continued neglect of the Country towards me, has an effect in putting my
   reputation to stake; which as it has always been my principle, so it is
   now, more than ever my duty to preserve.

   I feel no reproof to myself in speaking thus freely; my situation and the
   relationship that now ought to subsist between me and America, make it
   necessary, and I speak so with the more freedom, because it is done to a
   confidential Body and not to the world, and is as much the effect of a
   good disposition as of concern.

   Scarcely had I put my foot into the Country but it was set on fire about
   my ears. All the plans or prospects of private life (for I am not by
   nature fond of, or fitted for a public one, and feel all occasions of it
   where I must act personally, a burden) all these plans, I say, were
   immediately disconcerted, and I was at once involved in all the troubles
   of the Country. From a principle devoted to the love of liberty, and a
   disposition to assist injured and suffering people, I felt a pleasure in
   sharing their fate without even troubling myself about consequences. I had
   none of those inducements arising from property of possessions that might
   operate in a more or less degree with others. I stood on the clear
   unencumbered line of principle and had no other interest to engage me but
   that of the heart.

   As the progress of the war continued I very likely derived something of
   satisfaction from the idea of being ranked among the founders of a New
   Empire raised on the principles of liberty and liberality. Yet large as
   that Empire is, and fortunate in its circumstances, it does not afford to
   me a home, and I have both the pleasure and the concern to see, that, I
   have spent eight years of the prime of my life, in adding to the happiness
   of those, who, in return appear thoughtless of mine.

   I cannot help viewing my situation as singularly inconvenient. Trade I do
   not understand. Land I have none, or what is equal to none. I have exiled
   myself from one Country without making a home of another; and I cannot
   help sometimes asking myself, what am I better off than a refugee? and
   that of the most extraordinary kind, a Refugee from the Country I have
   obliged and served, to that which can owe me no good will.

   Tho' it was impossible I could be insensible of the daily inconveniences
   I experienced during almost the whole of the war; yet as they served to
   give me a clear standing in the world, and to shew that I acted from
   impulse and not from interest, from principle and not from influence, I
   endeavored instead of growing discontented, to turn them into matters not
   only of consolation but of satisfaction. As an Author, I had gained the
   Ear and the confidence of a Country made of many parts, I had likewise been
   singular in obtaining a general reading in England, and since that, on the
   Continent of Europe. In this situation as I could be useful, so it was
   necessary I should sacrifice something to preserve that usefulness. I
   easily saw that favor or partiality to me might tend to destroy it. One
   part of America might have supposed that I belonged to another, or one set
   of Politicians might Imagine that I was attached to their opposites in
   local matters. Therefore I kept at a distance from all and acted my part
   alone. And so far as the neglect of Congress to me might arise from the
   same kind of reflections it was politic. But I now think the Experiment
   has continued long enough, especially as the war is over. 
   
   Badly as the
   Army has been off, I was yet in some instances still worse. I was not so
   much as in the line of any state. I had even my own Rations to provide,
   and while serving all I was neglected by all and belonged to none.

   Having said thus much on matters generally I shall now beg leave  to
   trouble the Committee, with a short detail of some principle facts.

   The first public work I undertook (and the first thing I ever published in
   my life except a few miscellaneous pieces in the Pennsylvania Magazine in
   the year 75 for in England I never was the author of a syllable in print)
   was the pamphlet Common Sense. It cannot at this time a day be forgotten
   that the politics, the opinions and the prejudices of the Country were in
   direct opposition to the principles contained in that work. And I well
   know that in Pennsylvania, and I suppose the same in other of the then
   Provinces, it would have been unsafe for a man to have espoused
   independence in any public company and after the appearance of that
   pamphlet it was as dangerous to speak against it. It was a point of time
   full of critical danger to America, and if her future well being depended
   on any one political circumstance more than another it was in changing the
   sentiments of the people from dependence to Independence and from the
   monarchial to the republican form of government; for had she unhappily
   split on the question, or entered coldly or hesitatingly into it, she most
   probably had been ruined; and as for myself, had it failed, I know not
   where any home in the world would have been, and tho' it has succeeded I
   am but little better off.

   It cannot be very agreeable to a man to be obliged to speak of himself,
   but if the situation of any one for years together can apologize for or
   justify it, I think I may venture to lay claim to the excuse.

   As my wish was to serve an oppressed people, and assist in a just and good
   Cause, I conceived that the honor of it would be promoted by my declining
   to make even the usual profits of an Author, by the publication, and
   therefore I gave up the profits of the first Edition into the hands of
   Col. Joseph Deane and Mr. Thomas Pryor both of the city of Philadelphia to
   be disposed of by them in any public service or private charity. After
   this I printed six thousand at my own expense and directed Mr. Bradford to
   sell them at the price of the printing and paper. It may, perhaps, be
   said, that as I had made a dangerous step it was my interest to make it as
   little so as possible by promoting by every means, the success of the
   principle on which my own safety rested, but this would be an uncandid way
   of accounting for public spirit and conduct.

   After the declaration of Independence, the Pennsylvania associators
   marched into Jersey, under the Command of General Roberdeau, to whom I
   went as secretary without pay. And after his command at Amboy expired and
   the Associators returned home I served as Volunteer aid to General Greene
   at fort Lee, and continued with him during the gloomy Campaign of
   Seventy-Six.

   The wretched and despairing condition of the Country occasioned me to
   publish the first number of the Crisis at a time when few would venture to
   speak and the printing presses had left off working. I began it at Newark
   on the retreat and got it printed in Philadelphia the 19th of Dec. 1776.
   But the printer did not choose to put his name to it.

   On the return of Congress from Baltimore they unanimously and unknown to
   me, appointed me secretary to the Committee for foreign Affairs which I
   was afterwards obliged to resign on account of the affair of Silas Deane.

   It very unfortunately happened to me that I was in possession of a Secret,
   respecting the supplies from abroad and the money demands of Silas Deane
   which I have good reason to believe Congress were not altogether, if, at
   all, acquainted with. The Despatches which should have contained the
   information never arrived at Congress, blank white paper being put in
   their stead, and that which afterwards came into my hands enjoined in
   these words, "*That it be kept a dead secret even from Congress where it is
   supposed England has some intelligence.*" This was in the hand writing of
   Temple Franklin. That Deane had imposed on his friends and was attempting
   a fraud on the Country was exceedingly visible to me, and the event has
   proved that something must have been very wrong in his conduct or he
   needed not, with so popular a support at first, have made the retreat he
   did.

   On the Evening of the day on which my resignation was made, a very
   lucrative offer, to double the value of what I had resigned was made to
   me, and repeated for three successive Evenings. What the motive was that
   led to the proposal I am somewhat at a loss to conceive. It might be
   friendship only. But in the situation I then stood I thought it right to
   decline it; and preferred hiring myself as a Clerk to Mr. Owen Biddle, at
   the usual wages of a Common Clerk to avoid running into Debt. In which
   place I continued, still going on in the same line of Common Sense I had
   done before, until the Assembly of Pennsylvania, without any application,
   or even knowledge of mine, appointed me their Clerk.

   The next summer introduced itself by the loss of Charles Town, and I could
   not but be confounded at what appeared to me an obstinate disbelief in
   almost all ranks of People, respecting the fate of that place as if
   believing or disbelieving would govern facts.

   The finances of Congress and of the several States were in a deplorable
   condition, and scarcely any thing was left but private credit, and in a
   letter from the Commander in Chief to the President of Pennsylvania
   stating the condition of the Army and urging resistance, and which was
   read confidentially to the house with the doors locked, the complication
   of difficulties were so affecting, that some of the members began to think
   them past relief.

   In this state of things, and without mentioning the matter either at the
   time or since, I addressed the enclosed letter No. 1 to Mr. Blair
   McClenaghan to try what might be done in that line of private credit and
   assistance. I drew out all the Salary that was due to me, being about a
   thousand dollars, and enclosed 500 as a deposit for the whole. &mdash; Mr.
   McClenaghan introduced the matter and the letter among the merchants at
   the Coffee and subscribed two hundred pounds hard money. Mr.
   Morris did the same, and by the next day the subscription
   amounted to one thousand five hundred pounds which was afterwards thrown
   into a Bank and the army assisted, if not principally supplied, thro
   the remainder of the summer by that means.

   Towards the latter end of this year, 1780, I conceived the Idea of going to
   Europe on the following grounds.

   By all the English papers, publications and politics that ever came to my
   hands during the Contest, it was exceedingly evident, at least to me, that
   the British, as a nation, were in a state of profound Ignorance respecting
   many Circumstances in America, and had only a loose uninformed notion of
   others, and that they prosecuted the war, so far as Conquest was the
   object, on the ground of delusion. There was like no person in England who
   knew enough of the Affairs of America to remove that delusion and those
   who were supposed to know America best, such as Galloway and
   others, were on the wrong side, and the political parties in Parliament
   were so heated against each other that no argument from either could
   effect the other. And we frequently saw that even these who were against
   the war, were in many instances as wrong as those who were for it.

   In this state of things, it was rational to conclude that could a person,
   who knew the country and the people, and was acquainted with the affairs
   and Politics of America, to convey himself secretly from this Country to
   that, he might by a well timed and well composed publication, avoiding as
   much as possible all English parties, have gone a great way, at least in
   debilitating the rancorous spirit of the nation, and by removing their
   delusion have disposed them to peace. For the press, wherever it can be
   freely used, is an Engine, even in the affairs of government, whose force
   does not admit of Calculation. And could the Enemy have gotten hold of our
   press, in the same manner we could have got hold of theirs in England
   their chance of conquest would have been far greater than it was.

   I mentioned this design confidentially to then President of the State,
   General Reed, who scarcely knew what to say about it. He seemed
   to approve it but thought it both difficult and dangerous. But as I saw my
   own way exceedingly clear in it, and felt a rational Consolation, and a
   self-approving humanity in attempting it, I presented a Petition to the
   house of Assembly for leave of absence for one year, discontinuing my
   salary from the time my absence should commence. And as it was necessary
   for my own safety sake, and for the success of the plan, that I should
   conceal the true reason of my absence, I assigned instead thereof, that
   it was to collect and furnish myself with materials for a history of the
   revolution.

   But the time of the House for that year, being on the point of expiring,
   the house thought they had no right to give leave in a manner that more
   properly belonged to the next. And the next house having several new
   members, and somewhat variously composed, and many of them viewing my
   letter as a kind of withdrawing from the appointment, or giving preference
   to something else, and as I could enter into no explanation with them I
   found it most convenient to proceed no farther in the application. General
   Mifflin who was then a member of the House asked me some questions
   respecting my intention of continuing in the Clerkship of the house, and I
   saw they proceeded from motives, and were accompanied with offers of
   friendship, I confided my design fully to him, and resigned the office of
   Clerk.

   I had saved as much money out of the pay I received as Clerk as would bear
   my expences to Europe, which was all I wanted. Neither did I see any
   danger to myself but the being known or catched up in England before I
   could get out the publication I intended which I meant should appear
   anonymously as from a person who had made the Tour of America in Cog. And I
   am now more than ever persuaded, from the reception and success which my
   Letter to the Abbe Raynal has met with in England, and the new light which
   all their accounts acknowledge have been thrown on the affairs of America
   by that publication, that to have laid hold of the English presses at that
   time, in the manner I mention, would have been a serviceable and capital
   piece of policy, and what is still more, it would have been humanity.

   The ship Franklin and the unfortunate ship Shelalah were getting ready for
   sea, and I intended a passage on the one or other of them. &mdash; But on my
   mentioning the matter to General Greene who was then at
   Philadelphia on his way to the Southward, he expressed some apprehensions
   on the case, and when he arrived at Annapolis he wrote me the enclosed
   letter No. 2 strongly dissuading me from it. And the fate of Major Andre
   happening at the same time, I felt some apprehensions of becoming an
   object of retaliation should I have been discovered in England when my
   first landing, and therefore gave the intention up.

   I was now once more in the world without the least dependance on it. But
   as I was of a turn of mind not very easily discouraged, and had sat down
   from the first with an expectation of difficulties, and a disposition as
   well as a determination to bear with every thing I might meet with, I felt
   the less under them.

   Some short time before this I had published the Crisis extraordinary, on
   the resources and revenues of America, a copy of which I enclose. My
   design in this publication was not only to shew the necessity and
   advantage of going into a solid System of Taxes, but to make use of that
   Publication in England, as an opportunity of shewing that America was in
   no danger from the want of resources.

   I had likewise drawn up a private Letter marked No. 3 to a nobleman in
   France which I remember showing to a gentleman now in Congress, a
   considerable time before any proposition for sending Col. Laurens took
   place, and which is the letter referred to in General Greene's letter to
   me. The principles and Politics in this Letter, as they will do me no
   discredit, they will likewise serve to shew an unvaried and unabated
   application an attachment to the Cause of America even at a time she was
   acting so coldly and carelessly by me.

   On the appointment of Col. Laurens to the Court of France, he expressed to
   me his wishes, that as he felt himself out of the Political line, that I
   would accompany him, and as it appeared to me a convenient opportunity to
   get out the Publication intended I accepted the proposition and went with
   him. He proposed, in order to make it worth my while, that I should act as
   secretary to him; But the prejudiced interference of two or three
   gentlemen then of Congress but now out one of whom (who I am sure will
   never forgive me for publishing Common Sense and going a step beyond him
   in Literary reputation) went so far as to tell Col. Laurens, that he
   doubted my principles, *for that I did not join in the Cause till it was
   late*, made it best, in order to avoid contention, and guard against
   accidents, to change the plan of secretaryship, and for me to go only as a
   Companion.

   After the business of his Embassy was dispatched, which it was impossible
   any man could have executed with more address and alacrity than himself,
   and the affairs of America were put into a prosperous train, I told Col.
   Laurens that though I had every wish it was possible a man could feel for
   the success of the cause which America was engaged in, yet such had been
   the treatment I had received, and such the hardships and difficulties I
   had experienced year after year, that I had no heart to return back, and
   was resolved not to do it&mdash; That whatever service I had rendered her she
   was perfectly welcome to, and that as far as any abilities of mine could
   go, in any part of Europe, that I should invariably continue the advocate
   of her cause, and that it was likewise a decided opinion with me that, as
   matters then stood, I could render her more service, by justifying her
   cause and explaining and clearing up her affairs in Europe, where they
   appeared to be but darkly understood, than by any thing I could do in
   America. But that it appeared an Act of meanness to me, to return to a
   Country where I had experienced so much thankless treatment.

   I mentioned these reasons in a letter from France to the Honble Mr. Izard,
   and I have no objections to that Gentleman's producing the letter if he
   has it yet by him.

   But such was Col Laurens's passionate attachment to me, and the more so
   when he saw my letter to Mr. Izard, that his importunities for my
   returning with him were pressing and excessive, and he carried them to
   such a height, that I felt I should not be very easy to myself do which I
   would; and as he would have had nobody with him on the passage if any
   misfortune had befallen him, I gave into his wishes and accompanied him
   back.

   After our return we parted company on the road soon after we left
   Providence, occasioned by the sulky I was in breaking down. We parted the
   money he had with him, of which I had six guineas, and he not much more,
   with which I had to bear my own Expences and that of a servant he left
   with me and two horses, for three hundred miles, and I was obliged to
   borrow a dollar at Borden Town to pass the ferry with. Perhaps two such
   Travellers as Col Laurens and myself on such a national business is a
   novelty.

   He left with me five guineas when he went from Philadelphia, out of which
   I was to buy some few things for him and follow on to the siege of York
   but this soon became impracticable from the want of means.

   Of the many letters I received from him after this until the time of his
   death, I enclose one marked No. 4. I enclose one, as it serves in general
   as a voucher for what I have said respecting my connection with him and
   the concord that subsisted between us, for it is certainly some reputation
   in a man to be esteemed most by those who know him best.

   But notwithstanding the wishes and intentions of Col. Laurens I had again
   to experience a revival of every former difficulty.

   I now felt myself worse off than ever. My intention of getting out a
   publication in Europe was prevented by my speedy return from that country.
   The money I had taken with me and which had been saved out of my Salary as
   Clerk of the assembly was expended, The design of Col. Laurens in placing
   me as Secretary had been frustrated, and the Clerkship of the House, which
   though of but little worth, was better than nothing, was in other hands;
   and I had the mortification of knowing that all this arose from an anxiety
   to serve in, and promote the Cause of a Country, whose Circumstances were
   then rising into Prosperity, and who, though she owed something of that
   Prosperity to me appeared every day careless of whatever related to my
   personal interest.

   From an unwillingness to upbraid, I was silent, and assumed an appearance
   of cheerfulness and contentment when I had nothing to make me so, but a
   Consolation in my own integrity and a Satisfaction in seeing the war was
   drawing towards a fortunate issue. Neither is it possible to discover any
   publication of mine during this situation, which continued several months
   the least tincture of discontent. I was determined to go on to the last,
   and when I could go no further, I intended to ask some merchant or Capt
   of a vessel to give me a passage to Holland, where I was sure of being
   safe, and could not be worse off. I could not be insensible that I had
   abilities that could be useful, but the inconvenient situation I stood in
   narrowed and cramped the exercise of them, and held me, whenever I
   reflected on it, in a state of disquietude. &mdash; I had a mind disposed to
   public service, but above either asking or complaining. &mdash; I was conscious
   that I had acted generously and honorably, and if that would not speak for
   itself I had no intention to speak for it.

   This Winter the Commander in Chief resided in Philadelphia, and I took an
   opportunity from an opening which his friendship afforded me to disclose
   my situation to him, for as I must have done it to somebody, or left the
   Country in a state of Circumstances which must have reflected dishonor
   either on her or me, I judged I could not do it better than to himself
   whose situation detached him from all political parties and bound him
   alike to all and to the whole.

   From his friendship towards me and an opinion he had pleased to form of my
   past services and probable future usefulness, he became affectionately
   interested in the account I gave him, and concerted with a friend or two
   to make my continuance in America convenient to myself until a proper time
   might offer to do it more permanently.

   As I had been formerly in the department for foreign Affairs I was again
   distantly attached to it while under the management of Mr. Livingstone.
   But so far as related to any publications of mine, it was a condition
   between us that I should do as I saw best, and he confided totally and
   entirely that matter to me. In the instance of Capt. Huddy and Capt.
   Asgil he informed me of an opportunity he then had of sending to Europe
   and wished that I would state that unfortunate and distressing affair in
   its true light, so as to prevent mistakes taking place abroad or unjust
   reflection being cast on the temper or humanity of America, which I did,
   at least to the best of my power in a letter signed Common Sense, and
   addressed to Sir Guy Carleton, and which was published, I believe, in all
   the papers of America. I mention this as being the only instance in which
   he even pointed anything out to me, and this was intirely a National
   concern. Mr. Livingstone's Resignation dissolved the matter between us,
   and left me in the former state as before, which has continued ever since.

   The Abbe Raynal's account of the Revolution arriving here, his mistakes
   afforded me, in part, the opportunity I had wished for, of throwing out a
   Publication that should reach Europe, and by obtaining a general read
   there, put the affairs of America and the revolution in the point of light
   in which they ought to be viewed and printed my answer to him at my own
   expence, and made a present of one hundred copies to be sent to France, 50
   of which I sent to Mr. Livingstone's office for the purpose, and 50 to 
   the office of finance. I made the army a present 50.
   I enclosed the secretary of Congress an order on the printer for 156,
   being thirteen dozen, to be sent as occasion might offer to the several
   governments, but, from what reason I know not, they were not accepted.
   Upon the whole I gave away nearly five hundred, for all I aimed at on this
   side the water was to reimburse myself the expences of printing which was
   about one hundred pounds. In England the Booksellers cannot have made less
   by it than three hundred guineas, but with them it was business, with me
   it was an affection. The publication arriving in England just at the time
   the negociation for peace was beginning, it could have no ill effect, and
   probably a good one, in promoting the issue.

   The new arrangement of revenue proposed by Congress for carrying on the
   war, on the decline of the paper Currency was, in the year eighty one, the
   principal hope of the Enemy, and as I knew I had the ear of the Continent,
   and I believe its good opinion, it was the most serviceable point I could
   employ myself in. The best arguments that could be used either in Congress
   or in the Assemblies, were confined to the walls, and it is only by the
   press, the tongue of the world, that they can be brought before the Eyes
   and Ears of all men.

   How far any publications of mine on this subject might be useful in other
   States, I am not so well acquainted with, but I have authority to speak on
   what happened in the State of Pennsylvania.

   Upon the recommendation of Congress, and the quota of the State of eight
   millions of Dollars, a division took place in the house, and it was
   carried by only one vote, which was the Speakers casting vote.

   The Speaker Mr. Muhlenburgh mentioned this Circumstance to me, and on
   the day on which it was to come on again I got out a Publication on the
   subject, and in the Evening, Mr. Muhlenburgh came to inform me of its
   effect, for that all opposition had ceased and the house which before had
   been equally divided had that day been unanimous.

   I shall close this narrative with an Account of my Journey to Rhode Island
   last winter.

   As no nation whose individuals are wealthy and their public revenues poor
   and inadequate to their defence, can be considered in a state of honorable
   safety either in war or peace. I undertook, of my own choice, and without
   the least intimation from any person whatever, and wholly and perfectly at
   my own expence, (except the hire of a horse, which was lent me by Mr.
   Joshua Wallace of rariton), a Journey to the State of Rhode Island at the
   time the five per cent duty was in agitation. It was nearly indifferent to
   me whether I was there or here. My intentions were liberal, they were
   friendly, and what is equal to anything they were honest. I had been an
   exceedingly welcome visitor at Providence in Company with Col. Laurens
   when he returned from France with the Money which the five per cent duty
   was, in part, intended to discharge, and the pleasure of repaying ought to
   be as great as that of receiving.

   That the five per cent duty was darkly understood and worse represented
   was visible to me by the publications which were introduced from 
   Rhode Island into the
   Philadelphia news-papers, and as it was a matter, which, the less it was
   blazed about the world, the less would the reputation of America suffer,
   it was therefore, in me, a piece of prudence to make the debate as limited
   as possible by keeping it to the Rhode-Island papers only, and for the
   same reason I avoided putting the signature of Common Sense.

   But it is more than probable that misfortune will accomplish at last, what
   prudence and good policy could not at first; for when it becomes
   perceiveable that the Trade of America is run away with by foreigners, who
   are here today and gone to-morrow, the opposers of the measure will have
   other Ideas; for there was an experience to be had in the matter which the
   times, and the state of Trade, did not then apply to, and which prejudice
   could not foresee &mdash; 

   I have now stated to the Committee some of the principal matters which
   have employed my time and attention in America, and some of the
   difficulties they have been attended with. &mdash; The War being now ended, and
   happily for America, that disposition which led me to partake of, and
   share in, the distresses and hardships of the Country is no longer
   necessary, and I should appear rather a whimsical than a rational man, to
   affect it when there is no occasion. For the sake of serving others in a
   Cause that was just and honorable, I have severe to myself, and if
   Nature gave me any abilities that could be publicly useful, I have been as
   free in giving them away. &mdash; But the duty I owe to myself requires me now to
   pay some attention to the means of living in the world. &mdash; Scenes of War and
   Tumult were as unnatural and opposite to me as they could possibly be to
   any man in America; and as the impulse which led me on and the constant
   agitation of mind, which in a great measure kept me from feeling, and in all
   cases from regarding inconveniences, are calmed by the issue of the war, I
   may now, as the last in my own Consideration, justly employ my thoughts to
   make my private situation consistent and agreeable. &mdash; Party of every kind I
   have constantly avoided in every thing that did not apply to the interest
   of all, and so national have I been, that the State I have lived in
   scarcely knows me as a Citizen in any thing but the Tax-book. Even the
   distinction of Whig and Tory are very rarely to be met with in any
   publications of mine; for as I considered myself as endeavouring to raise
   recruits in the Cause of freedom every one which could be gained to it was
   an addition to its strength and interest, and if I have any Enemies I am
   conscious of not having deserved them.

   Having thus stated my own situation to the Committee, I beg leave to offer
   to them some observations on the proposed appointment of an
   Historiographer to the Continent.

   That so extraordinary a revolution should pass without care being taken to
   leave to Posterity an authenticated History of it, would hereafter call
   the literary character of the present America in question.

   But the matters which unite themselves in this Revolution are so various
   and numerous, so complicated and extensive, so made up of public and
   private, and so connected in the beginning with the politics of England,
   and in its progress with those of almost every country in Europe, that to
   gain all the necessary Information will be exceedingly difficult, and to
   select such parts as are important enough to be read for ever, and omit the
   diminutives, will be a work of almost endless observation.

   I observed that in writing Common-Sense however easy it may appear now it
   is over, the necessity of knowing both Countries was so material, that no
   person who had reflected only on one could have sufficiently succeeded in
   a proposition for their political separation: and tho' that pamphlet has
   much to say respecting England, it has never been attacked in that country
   on the score of error or mistake, which scarcely would have happened had
   the writer known only one side of the water. Something of the same
   knowledge was necessary in answering the Abbe Raynal because he treated of
   the involved matters of both Countries. An English Historian, supposing
   him ever so dispossessed of prejudice or partiality will unavoidably err
   when he comes to treat of America, and an American Historian will be
   subject to the same inconvenience when he enters on English matters.

   Perhaps there is no history that ever required to be more carefully
   guarded than that of the present Revolution. The nations now separated and
   opposed have both the same language and the same freedom of the press, and
   therefore the history ought to be such as England cannot deny, the means
   for her doing it being so easy.

   To give the present Revolution its full foundation and extent in the world,
   it seems necessary there should be three Histories &mdash; one that should state
   fully all the leading principles, policy and facts of the revolution, so
   as not only to inform posterity but to confirm them in the true principles
   of freedom and Civil government. &mdash; A second, being rather an abstract of the
   first cast into easy and graceful language to be used as a standing
   school-book. &mdash; And a third for Europe or the world; In this last all
   partiality to forms of government or defence of any one in preference to
   another should be omitted, and the facts of the revolution only attended
   to, which such reflections on them as may serve to promote the general good
   and peace of mankind without disturbing their modes of government. This
   last is the plan on which my answer to the Abbe Raynal is conducted. There
   is nothing respecting forms of government in it, for asI intended it for
   the purpose of setting forth the affairs and advocating the Cause of
   America in Europe I was careful in attending to this point, and by so
   doing it became eligible to be translated into the European Languages, and
   has already been reprinted in French at Paris &mdash; 

   So far as the committee of their own accord and opinion have thought me
   fit for the undertaking I present them my thanks &mdash; But the manner how any
   one is to be enabled to go through the work is a matter of nice
   consideration.

   To leave the History of the Revolution to chance, to party, or partiality
   of any kind, or to be performed as a matter of profit, will subject the
   character of the present age to various and hazardous representations &mdash; And
   tho' it cannot be compleated as it ought without the aid of, and a
   confidential Communication with Congress &mdash; yet for Congress to reserve to
   themselves the least appearance of influence over an Historian, by
   annexing thereto a yearly salary subject to their own Controul, will
   endanger the reputation of both of the Historian and the History. And the
   Experience I had in the affairs of Silas Deane while I was Secretary in
   the foreign department has taught me to know how uncertain dependence is.

   Neither can a yearly Salary answer the purpose. The Expense of Collecting
   materials and information from the different parts of America and abroad
   (for a man cannot do it effectually unless he does it personally) the
   time it will take to digest and arrange them and the charge of printing
   the work and engraving the plates necessary or ornamental to it will
   amount to several thousand pounds before any part could be reimbursed &mdash; And
   I must question whether the sale in America would in any moderate length
   of Time defray the Charge &mdash; The printing and paper only of my letter to the
   Abbe Raynal cost me a hundred pounds besides fifteen pounds more for
   folding and binding.

   The Cold conduct of America towards me for my past services has disabled
   me from rendering those I would now wish to do. It is a treatment that is
   killing to public spirit: and while it serves to hold the character of
   America as unfavourable to letters and literary studies it likewise serves
   to banish genius to other Countries. The Literature of America is now sunk
   into, and comprised in News-papers, and tho I am the only one whose
   writings have reached Europe it will very probably be my lot to follow
   them.

   From one who have been the friend and not the servant of America, the
   helper and not the receiver, and whose heart is naturally bound to her
   cause, and whose wishes are for her happiness and character, these plain
   declarations, tho perhaps not pleasing, will I hope be favorably
   received. It is the only representation I ever intend to make and it is
   fit that I should do it effectually.

   It may very probably have supposed even by Congress, that my
   situation during this long period of the war was rendered convenient,
   either by the state I lived in or by some other means. 
   
   From the State of
   Pennsylvania I have never received the least grain of assistance or favor,
   except the office of Clerk of the Assembly, and the committee are already
   informed of my motive for resigning it. That State always beheld me in the
   light of a Continental man, and it is probable the Continent supposed me
   as belonging to the State, till between the two my situation has been what
   I described it.

   But as I have gone thus far into my narrative and have seen the beginning
   and the end of the war, and have contributed in some degree, to erect a
   new Empire in the world, founded on better principles than those of the
   old, I have now no wish or inclination to seek another citizenship
   elsewhere or be recognized as a member of any other Country or Community
   than that which I have helped to raise. I am induced to venture, nice as
   the matter is to me, to express to the Committee, and thro' them to
   Congress, the following suggestion. Neither does it arise from any
   species of avarice from the part I acted, and the reputation which I
   cannot be insensible, I enjoy, both moral and literary, and of which this
   country cannot refuse her Evidence, are, I presume, sufficient to make any
   liberal country in Europe a happier home to me, as a private individual,
   than America has been to me as a public one.

   The Committee have now before them my situation fully, and likewise some
   remarks on the proposition for appointing an Historiographer. They see
   that from a disposition to serve others, I neglected myself for years
   together. &mdash; If, then, the part I have chosen and acted has been of any
   benefit to America, it remains unacknowledged; &mdash; if it has not it requires
   none: Or if it is consistent with the honor and character of a Country to
   receive favors from individuals she is fully welcome to what she has had
   from me.

   But as to oblige and be obliged is fair and friendly, she has it in her
   choice, whether she will in return make my situation such, as I can with
   happiness to myself, and unconfined by dependence, remain in the rank of a
   Citizen of America, or whether I must wish her well and say to her, Adieu.

   If she chooses the first I wish it to have a retrospect to past services
   only, and not in the least combined with any particular service in
   prospect. My own disposition will of itself supply conditions and such the
   peculiar piety of literary service in public affairs, that conditions
   destroy both their spirit and effects.

   If after this I undertake a history of the revolution it will be perfectly
   voluntary and with freedom to myself, and if Congress pleases to give me
   the appointment of Historiographer, as honorary, and without Salary or
   Conditions, it will facilitate the collection of materials and give the
   work the foundation of impartiality and clear it of all appearance or
   suspicion of influence.

   I have now only to apologize to the committee for taking up so much of
   their time, and to request that the freedom of my observations may be
   received with the same good disposition with which they are given, and to
   subscribe myself to the Committee &mdash; Their much obliged, and Obedient Humble
   Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
