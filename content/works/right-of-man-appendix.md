   As the publication of this work has been delayed beyond the time intended,
   I think it not improper, all circumstances considered, to state the causes
   that have occasioned delay.

   The reader will probably observe, that some parts in the plan contained in
   this work for reducing the taxes, and certain parts in Mr. Pitt's speech
   at the opening of the present session, Tuesday, January 31, are so much
   alike as to induce a belief, that either the author had taken the hint
   from Mr. Pitt, or Mr. Pitt from the author.- I will first point out the
   parts that are similar, and then state such circumstances as I am
   acquainted with, leaving the reader to make his own conclusion.

   Considering it as almost an unprecedented case, that taxes should be
   proposed to be taken off, it is equally extraordinary that such a measure
   should occur to two persons at the same time; and still more so
   (considering the vast variety and multiplicity of taxes) that they should
   hit on the same specific taxes. Mr. Pitt has mentioned, in his speech, the
   tax on Carts and Wagons- that on Female Servants- the lowering the tax on
   Candles and the taking off the tax of three shillings on Houses having
   under seven windows.

   Every one of those specific taxes are a part of the plan contained in this
   work, and proposed also to be taken off. Mr. Pitt's plan, it is true, goes
   no further than to a reduction of three hundred and twenty thousand
   pounds; and the reduction proposed in this work, to nearly six millions. I
   have made my calculations on only sixteen millions and an half of revenue,
   still asserting that it was "very nearly, if not quite, seventeen
   millions." Mr. Pitt states it at 16,690,000. I know enough of the matter
   to say, that he has not overstated it. Having thus given the particulars,
   which correspond in this work and his speech, I will state a chain of
   circumstances that may lead to some explanation.

   The first hint for lessening the taxes, and that as a consequence flowing
   from the French revolution, is to be found in the ADDRESS and DECLARATION
   of the Gentlemen who met at the Thatched-House Tavern, August 20, 1791.
   Among many other particulars stated in that Address, is the following, put
   as an interrogation to the government opposers of the French Revolution.
   "Are they sorry that the pretence for new oppressive taxes, and the
   occasion for continuing many old taxes will be at an end?"

   It is well known that the persons who chiefly frequent the Thatched-House
   Tavern, are men of court connections, and so much did they take this
   Address and Declaration respecting the French Revolution, and the
   reduction of taxes in disgust, that the Landlord was under the necessity
   of informing the Gentlemen, who composed the meeting of the 20th of
   August, and who proposed holding another meeting, that he could not
   receive them.*[41]

   What was only hinted in the Address and Declaration respecting taxes and
   principles of government, will be found reduced to a regular system in
   this work. But as Mr. Pitt's speech contains some of the same things
   respecting taxes, I now come to give the circumstances before alluded to.

   The case is: This work was intended to be published just before the
   meeting of Parliament, and for that purpose a considerable part of the
   copy was put into the printer's hands in September, and all the remaining
   copy, which contains the part to which Mr. Pitt's speech is similar, was
   given to him full six weeks before the meeting of Parliament, and he was
   informed of the time at which it was to appear. He had composed nearly the
   whole about a fortnight before the time of Parliament meeting, and had
   given me a proof of the next sheet. It was then in sufficient forwardness
   to be out at the time proposed, as two other sheets were ready for
   striking off. I had before told him, that if he thought he should be
   straitened for time, I could get part of the work done at another press,
   which he desired me not to do. In this manner the work stood on the
   Tuesday fortnight preceding the meeting of Parliament, when all at once,
   without any previous intimation, though I had been with him the evening
   before, he sent me, by one of his workmen, all the remaining copy,
   declining to go on with the work on any consideration.

   To account for this extraordinary conduct I was totally at a loss, as he
   stopped at the part where the arguments on systems and principles of
   government closed, and where the plan for the reduction of taxes, the
   education of children, and the support of the poor and the aged begins;
   and still more especially, as he had, at the time of his beginning to
   print, and before he had seen the whole copy, offered a thousand pounds
   for the copy-right, together with the future copy-right of the former part
   of the Rights of Man. I told the person who brought me this offer that I
   should not accept it, and wished it not to be renewed, giving him as my
   reason, that though I believed the printer to be an honest man, I would
   never put it in the power of any printer or publisher to suppress or alter
   a work of mine, by making him master of the copy, or give to him the right
   of selling it to any minister, or to any other person, or to treat as a
   mere matter of traffic, that which I intended should operate as a
   principle.

   His refusal to complete the work (which he could not purchase) obliged me
   to seek for another printer, and this of consequence would throw the
   publication back till after the meeting of Parliament, otherways it would
   have appeared that Mr. Pitt had only taken up a part of the plan which I
   had more fully stated.

   Whether that gentleman, or any other, had seen the work, or any part of
   it, is more than I have authority to say. But the manner in which the work
   was returned, and the particular time at which this was done, and that
   after the offers he had made, are suspicious circumstances. I know what
   the opinion of booksellers and publishers is upon such a case, but as to
   my own opinion, I choose to make no declaration. There are many ways by
   which proof sheets may be procured by other persons before a work publicly
   appears; to which I shall add a certain circumstance, which is,

   A ministerial bookseller in Piccadilly who has been employed, as common
   report says, by a clerk of one of the boards closely connected with the
   ministry (the board of trade and plantation, of which Hawkesbury is
   president) to publish what he calls my Life, (I wish his own life and
   those of the cabinet were as good), used to have his books printed at the
   same printing-office that I employed; but when the former part of Rights
   of Man came out, he took his work away in dudgeon; and about a week or ten
   days before the printer returned my copy, he came to make him an offer of
   his work again, which was accepted. This would consequently give him
   admission into the printing-office where the sheets of this work were then
   lying; and as booksellers and printers are free with each other, he would
   have the opportunity of seeing what was going on.- Be the case, however,
   as it may, Mr. Pitt's plan, little and diminutive as it is, would have
   made a very awkward appearance, had this work appeared at the time the
   printer had engaged to finish it.

   I have now stated the particulars which occasioned the delay, from the
   proposal to purchase, to the refusal to print. If all the Gentlemen are
   innocent, it is very unfortunate for them that such a variety of
   suspicious circumstances should, without any design, arrange themselves
   together.

   Having now finished this part, I will conclude with stating another
   circumstance.

   About a fortnight or three weeks before the meeting of Parliament, a small
   addition, amounting to about twelve shillings and sixpence a year, was
   made to the pay of the soldiers, or rather their pay was docked so much
   less. Some Gentlemen who knew, in part, that this work would contain a
   plan of reforms respecting the oppressed condition of soldiers, wished me
   to add a note to the work, signifying that the part upon that subject had
   been in the printer's hands some weeks before that addition of pay was
   proposed. I declined doing this, lest it should be interpreted into an air
   of vanity, or an endeavour to excite suspicion (for which perhaps there
   might be no grounds) that some of the government gentlemen had, by some
   means or other, made out what this work would contain: and had not the
   printing been interrupted so as to occasion a delay beyond the time fixed
   for publication, nothing contained in this appendix would have appeared.
