   Dear Sir

   Your very friendly letter by Mr. Dawson gave me the real sensation of
   happy satisfaction, and what served to encrease it was that he brought it
   to me himself before I knew of his arrival - I congratulate America on your
   election. There has been no Circumstance, with respect to America, since
   the times of her revolution, that has excited so much general attention
   and expectation in France, England, Ireland and Scotland, as the pending
   election for president of the United States, nor any of which the event
   has given more general joy.

   I thank you for the opportunity you give me of returning by the Maryland,
   but I shall wait the return of the vessel that brings Mr. Livingston.

   With respect to the general state of Politics in Europe, I mean such as
   are interesting to America, I am at a loss to give any decided opinion.
   The coalition of the north, which took place within a few weeks after the
   publication of the Maritime Compact, is, by the *untimely* death of Paul, in
   a state of suspense. I do not believe it is abandoned, but it is so far
   weakened that some of the ports of the North are again open to the english
   Commerce, as are also the Elba and the Wesar; and Hamburg is evacuated by
   the Danes. That the business is not yet settled you will see by Nelson's
   letter and the accounts from Stockholm which I enclose. The English
   Government has sent Lord St. Helens to Petersbourg but we have no news of
   the event of his Embassy.

   Nothing from Egypt since the battle of the 21 March. The event, however,
   admits of calculation, which is, that if the English get footing enough in
   that Country to hold themselves there, they will finally succeed; because
   they can be reinforced and the french cannot. It is said that England has
   made proposals of an Armistice to france, one of the conditions of which
   is that both parties shall evacuate Egypt. I know not the fact but it has
   the appearance of probability. It comes from Marbois.

   The only relief that france could have given to Egypt, and the only, or
   most effectual, aid she could have given to the coalition of the North
   (since she has no operative navy) would have been to have kept a strong
   fleet of Gun-boats on the belgic Coast, to be rowed by oars, and capable
   of transporting an hundred thousand men over to the English Coast on the
   North Sea. Had this been done, England could not have left her coast
   unguarded in the manner she has done to make the expedition to the Baltic
   and to Egypt; and if she had done it, the descent could have been made
   without scarcely any risk. I believe the Governt begins now to see it,
   and talk of doing it, but it ought to have been done a year ago. It was
   the point I endeavoured to press the most in my memorial to Bonaparte of
   which you have a copy.

   That march and Vessels under Convoy shall not be visited will answer very well 
   for the powers of the North, because as those Vessels must all pass the sound
   they can all take a convoy from thence and sail in fleets, but it does not
   answer for America whose vessels start singly from different points of a
   long line of coast. It was this that made me throw out the Idea in the
   Maritime Compact (without hinting at the Circumstances that suggested it)
   that the flag of each nation ought to be regarded as its convoy, and that
   no Vessel should hoist any other flag than its own.

   The treaty is not yet ratified. Murray has been here about ten days, and
   had not seen the french Commissioners two days ago. Mr. Dawson intended
   going round among them to learn all he could before he sent off the
   Vessel. Murray, as I understand, for I do not know him, is more a man of
   etiquette than of business; and if there is any intention here to delay
   the ratification his standing upon disputable ceremonies gives
   opportunities to that delay.

   I will suggest a thought to you, for which I have no other foundation than
   what arises in my own mind, which is, that the treaty was formed under one
   state of Circumstances and comes back for ratification under another state
   of Circumstances. When it was formed the powers of the North were uniting
   in Coalition to establish the principle generally and *perpetually* that
   free ships make free goods, and the treaty with America was formed upon
   that ground; but the Coalition of the North being in a great measure
   weakened, and the event of the dispute between them and England not yet
   known, I am inclined to suspect that france is waiting to know that event
   before she ratifies a treaty that will otherwise operate against herself;
   for if England cannot be brought to agree that the neutral powers shall
   carry for france, I see not how france can agree they shall carry for
   England.

   As to the explanation put upon this Article by Jay and Pickering that it
   refers to different wars in which being neutral one party is to carry for
   an Enemy in one war, and the other party when neutral to carry for an
   Enemy in another war, it appears to me altogether a sophism. It never
   could be the intention of it as a principle. Instead of such a treaty
   being a treaty of Amity and Commerce, it is a treaty of reciprocal
   injuries. It is like saying you shall break my head this time by aiding my
   Enemy, and I will break your head next time by aiding your Enemy; besides
   which, it is repugnant to every sentiment of human wisdom, human cunning,
   and human selfishness, to make such a contract. There is neither Nation
   nor Individual that will voluntarily consent to sustain a present Injury
   upon the distant prospect of an uncertain good; and even that good, if it
   were to arrive, would be but a bare equivalent for the injury; whereas it
   ought to be the double of it upon the score of credit, and the uncertainty
   of repayment. It is better that such an Article should not be inserted in
   a treaty than that such an unprincipled explanation and which in its
   operation must lead to contention, should be put upon.

   You will observe that in the beginning of the preceding paragraph I have
   said that when the treaty was formed the powers of the North were uniting
   in Coalition to establish the principle generally and *perpetually* that
   free Ships make free goods. The Senate has limited the duration of the
   Treaty to eight years, and consequently upon the explanation which the
   government gave to the same Article in the former treaty with france (see
   Pickering's long letter to Mr. Monroe) this Article in the present Treaty
   can have no reciprocity. It is limited in its operation to the present war,
   and the benefit of it is to England. The Article as containing a principle
   should have been exempt from the limitations or had some condition annexed
   to it that preserved the principle. The Senate by its contrivances has
   furnished with the opportunity of non-ratification, in case she finds, by
   the change of Circumstances that the treaty is to her injury.

   As these Ideas arise out of Circumstances which, by my being upon the
   spot, I became acquainted with before they can be known in America, I
   request you to accept them on that ground.

   Should the Treaty be ratified would it not afford a good opportunity
   (supposing the war to continue) to state to England, that as America,
   since her treaty with England, had formed a Treaty with her Enemy which
   stipulated for the right of carrying English property unmolested by that
   Enemy, it was become necessary to make a new arrangement with England as
   an equivalent for the advantages England derives in Consequence of that
   Treaty. I through this out for your private reflection. Should you see it in
   this light, and commission it to be done, no person would be more proper
   than Mr. Livingston, and the more so, as all the knowledge necessary to
   the execution of it would rest within himself, and thereby prevent any
   confusion that might otherwise arise as was the case with Jay's treaty.
   Besides which it is prudent to lessen the expence of European missions,
   and to condense two or three into one.

   As the unsettled state in which European politics now are will be the
   state in which they will appear to you when you receive this letter, I
   suggest to you whether it would not be best to order the Vessel, that is
   to bring out Mr. Livingston, to L'Orient, Nantz, or Bourdeaux, rather than
   to come up the channel. The Maryland has been visited in entering into
   (illegible) and it is best to avoid an effront when it can be done
   consistently especially in the present unsettled state of things.

   The Spaniards have entered Portugal and taken some forts and have orders
   to march on, unless Portugal, as a preliminary to an Armistice, shut her
   ports against the English.

   The french have again taken possession of several forts on the right shore
   of the Rhine, but I believe this measure is in concert with Austria to
   force the States of the Empire to finish the indemnifications. However,
   this unsettled state of things makes some impression here, and the funds
   have considerably fallen. England begins to awake to the apprehensions of
   a descent. If it be true that she has made preparations for an Armistice,
   this may be one of the causes of it.

   I now leave the embarrassed field of politics, for which if I have any
   talent, I have no liking, and come to the quiet scene of civil life. 
   
   You may recollect that I mentioned to you at Paris an Idea I had of
   constructing Carriage wheels by concentric circles in preference to the
   present method in which the pieces that compose the rim, or wheel, are cut
   cross the grain. This last winter I made three models. Two of them
   eighteen Inches diameter the other two feet. I have succeeded both as to
   solidity and beauty beyond my expectation. They are equally as firm as if
   they were a natural production and handsomer than any wheels ever yet
   made. But the machinery I invented, and the means I used, to bring them to
   this perfection I cannot describe in a letter. Had matters gone on in
   America in the same bad manner they went on for several years past my
   intention was to have taken out a patent for them in france and made a
   business of it. I shall bring them with me to America and also my bridges
   and make a business of them there, for it is best for me to be on the
   broad floor of the world and follow my own Ideas. What I mention to you
   concerning the wheels I repose with yourself only till I have the
   happiness to meet you.

   I am with wishes for your happiness and that of our Country your much
   obliged friend

   Thomas Paine
