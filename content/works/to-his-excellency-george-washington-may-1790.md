   To His Excellency George Washington  May 1790

   LONDON,

   SIR:

   Our very good friend, the Marquis de Lafayette, has entrusted to my care
   the key of the Bastille, and a drawing handsomely framed, representing the
   demolition of that detestable prison, as a present to your Excellency, of
   which his letter will more particularly inform. I feel myself happy in
   being the person through whom the Marquis has conveyed this early trophy
   of the spoils of despotism, and the first ripe fruits of American
   principles transplanted into Europe, to his master and patron. When he
   mentioned to me the present he intended you, my heart leaped with joy. It
   is something so truly in character, that no remarks can illustrate it, and
   is more happily expressive of his remembrance of his American friends,
   than any letters can convey. That the principles of America opened the
   Bastille is not to be doubted; and therefore the key comes to the right
   place.

   I beg leave to suggest to your Excellency the propriety of congratulating
   the King and Queen of France (for they have been our friends) and the
   National Assembly, on the happy example they are giving to Europe. You
   will see, by the King's speech, which I enclose, that he prides himself

   on being at the head of the revolution; and I am certain that such a
   congratulation will be well received, and have a good effect.

   I should rejoice to be the direct bearer of the Marquis's presents to your
   Excellency, but I doubt I shall not be able to see my much-loved America
   till next spring. I shall therefore send it by some American vessel to New
   York. I have permitted no drawing to be taken here, though it has been
   often requested, as I think there is a propriety that it should first be
   presented. But Mr. West wishes Mr. Trumbull to make a painting of the
   presentation of the key to you.

   I returned from France to London, about five weeks ago; and I am engaged
   to return to Paris, when the Constitution shall be proclaimed, and to
   carry the American flag in the procession. I have not the least doubt of
   the final and complete success of the French Revolution. Little ebbings
   and flowings, for and against, the natural companions of revolutions,
   sometimes appear, but the full current of it is, in my opinion, as fixed
   as the Gulf Stream.

   I have manufactured a bridge (a single arch), of one hundred and ten feet
   span, and five feet high from the chord of the arch. It is now on board a
   vessel, coming from Yorkshire to London, where it is to be erected. I see
   nothing yet to disappoint my hopes of its being advantageous to me. It is
   this only which keeps me in Europe; and happy shall I be, when I shall
   have it in my power to return to America. I have not heard of Mr.
   Jefferson since he sailed, except of his arrival. As I have always
   indulged the belief of having many friends in America, or rather no
   enemies, I have nothing else particularly to mention, but my affectionate
   remembrances to all; and am, Sir, with the greatest respect,

   Your most obliged and obedient, humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. If any of my friends are disposed to favor me with a letter, it will
   come to hand by addressing it to the care of Benjamin Vaughan, Esquire,
   Jeffries Square, London.
