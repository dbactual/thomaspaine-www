   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   London May 1st 1790 &mdash;

   Sir

   Our very good Friend the Marquis de la Fayette has entrusted to my care
   the Key of the Bastille and a drawing, handsomely framed, representing the
   demolition of that detestable prison as a present to your Excellency, of
   which his letter, will more particularly inform. I feel myself happy in
   being the person thro' whom the Marquis has conveyed this early trophy
   of the Spoils of Despotism, and the first ripe fruits of American
   principles transplanted into Europe to his Master and Patron &mdash; When he
   mentioned to me the present he intended you, my heart leaped with Joy &mdash; 
   It is something so truly in character that no remarks can illustrate it, and
   is more happily expressive of his remembrance of his American friends
   than any letters can convey. &mdash; That the principles of America opened 
   the Bastille is not to be doubted and therefore the key comes to the right
   place.

   I beg leave to suggest to your Excellency the propriety of congratulating
   the King and Queen of France (for they have been our friends) and the
   national assembly on the happy example they are giving to Europe. You
   will see by the King's Speech, which I enclose, that he prides himself
   on being at the head of the revolution, and I am certain that such a
   congratulation will be well received, and have a good effect.

   I should rejoice to be the direct bearer of the Marquis's presents to your
   Excellency but I doubt I shall not be able to see my much-loved America
   till next spring. I shall therefore send it by some *American* vessel to New
   York. &mdash; I have permitted no drawing to be taken here, tho' it has been
   often requested, as I think there is a propriety that it should first be
   presented. But Mr. West wishes Mr. Trumbull to make a painting of the
   presentation of the Key to you &mdash;

   I returned from France to London about five Weeks ago &mdash; and I am 
   engaged to return to Paris when the Constitution shall be proclaimed and to
   carry the American Flag in the procession &mdash; I have not the least doubt 
   of the final and compleat success of the French Revolution &mdash; Little 
   ebbings and flowings, for and against, the natural companions of revolutions,
   sometimes appear, but the full current of it, is, in my opinion, as fixed
   as the Gulf Stream &mdash;

   I have manufactured a Bridge (a single Arch) of one hundred & ten feet
   span, and five feet high from the cord of the Arch &mdash; It is now on board 
   a vessel coming from Yorkshire to London &mdash; where it is to be erected 
   &mdash; I see nothing yet to disappoint my hopes of its being advantageous to 
   me &mdash; it is this only which keeps me in Europe &mdash; and happy shall I 
   be when I shall
   have it in my power to return to America. &mdash; I have not heard of Mr.
   Jefferson since he sailed except of his arrival. 
   
   As I have always
   indulged the belief of having many friends in America, or rather no
   Enemies, I have nothing else particularly to mention, but my Affectionate
   remembrances to all &mdash; and am, Sir, with the greatest 
   
   Respect your much obliged and Obedient Humble servant

   THOMAS PAINE

   If any of my friends are disposed to favour me with a letter, it will
   come to hand by addressing it to the care of Benjn. Vaughan Esq.
