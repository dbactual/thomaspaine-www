   DEAR SIR:

   I have just a moment to spare to bid you farewell. We go on board in an
   hour or two with a fair wind and everything ready.

   I understand that you have expressed a desire to withdraw from business
   and I beg leave to assure you that every wish of mine will be employed to
   make your resignation, should it be accepted, attended with every possible
   mark of honor which your long services and high character in life justly
   merits.

   I am Dear Sir your most obedient humble servant

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Please to forward the letter directed to B. Edmunds.
