   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Dear Sir

   I enclose you a piece to serve as an introduction to two other pieces
   which you will receive by the same Conveyance. I observe the Consul Le
   Brun at the entertainment given to the American envoys gave for his toast.

   "À l'Union de l'Amérique avec les puissances du Nord pour faire respectre la 
   liberté des mers."
