   To Thomas Jefferson October 6, 1800

   DEAR SIR:

   I enclose you a piece to serve as an introduction to two other pieces
   which you will receive by the same conveyance. I observe the Consul Le
   Brun at the entertainment given to the American envoys gave for his toast:

   "To the union of America with the Powers of the world in order to
   guarantee the freedom of the seas." (The original is in French).

   T. P.
