   To Thomas Jefferson October 1800

   24 Vendemaire year 9

   PARIS,

   DEAR SIR:

   As the wind at one time and the tides at another prevented the
   commissioners sailing at the time they intended it gives me the
   opportunity of sending you an addition to the other pieces. We have
   nothing new since the date of my last. I send you a paragraph from a paper
   of yesterday, 15th October-23 Vendemaire.

   The arrangement between Denmark is but temporary. The first article is:
   the question respecting the right of visiting neutral ships going without
   convoy is sent to an ulterior discussion.

   "3 art-In order to prevent similar meetings from again causing disputes of
   the same nature, S. M. Danoisa will stop his convoys until later
   explanations of the same subject will have been able to effect a definite
   understanding." (The original is in french)

   Copenhagen, Aug, 1800.

   "The politics of the Northern Powers is developing further. The article
   published by the Petersburg newspaper of Sept. 15th, six days after the
   arrival of the Danish Courier (bearer of the news that the differences
   between England and Denmark had been ironed out) today confirms positively
   what was speculated two weeks ago, that is, that the execution of the plan
   directed against England's ambition has only been postponed by the three
   Northern Powers. If Paul ist's anger had been soothed by the convention of
   August 29th he would certainly not have made public on September 15th,
   that certain political circumstances lead S. M. to believe that a break
   with ^England may take place.

   "A remarkable circumstance, one which seems to prove that our court will
   not take an active part in this quarrel, is the kind of reserve with which
   the court newspaper has omitted this menacing passage, when transcribing
   the Petersburg paper." (The original is in french)

   This is by way of Berlin, and is the latest news we have from Russia.

   The translation of all the pieces I have sent you are in the press and I
   expect will be printed by tomorrow.

   Salut et respect,

   THOMAS PAINE.
