   To Benjamin Mosley October 1, 1792

   Oct. 1, 1 Year of the Republic.

   PARIS,

   You have before this time heard that the National Convention met punctual
   to the day appointed. The Members verified their powers on the 20th and
   met in Convention the 21st ult. The first business done was to abolish the
   bagatelle of Royalty which was decreed unanimously. This day the
   Convention will appoint a Committee of Constitution to consist of nine
   Members, who are to bring in a plan of the new Constitution. Affairs are
   turning round fast, the Prussion Army with Frederic and Brunswick at its
   head are about fourteen miles from Verdun, on the road towards Chilons.
   They are now very nearly in the condition that Burgoyne was in, in
   America. The King of Prussia has proposed to negotiate. It is I believe
   over with him as to any further operations. He says that he has been
   deceived by the Emigrants, expresses his astonishment at the vast Armies
   that surrounded him, and I believe, would think himself well off to get
   back again. Show this to our friend Fitzgerald.

   THOMAS PAINE.
