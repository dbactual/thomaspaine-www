   To James Madison  August 6, 1803

   BORDENTOWN ON THE DELAWARE,

   I wrote a few days ago to Mr. Breckenridge of Kentucky on the subject of
   Louisiana, or rather on the manner of bringing it before Congress. I put
   the letter under cover to Mr. Jefferson who, as I since see by the papers,
   is gone to Monticello. After I had sent off the letter a report was
   circulated that the British government had notified to our government, by
   way of caution, not to pay any of the purchase money, for that she
   (Britain) intended to take possession of Louisiana. That the British
   government is insolent and desperate enough to do this I have no doubt,
   but as this does not prove the fact I will be obliged to you to tell me,
   so far as you find yourself at liberty to do it, whether it be true or
   not. I can without making use of the fact make some use of the knowledge.
   . . .
