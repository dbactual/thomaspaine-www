   To Oliver Goldsmith  December 21, 1772

   Broad Street,

   EXCISE COFFEE HOUSE,

   HONORED SIR:

   Herewith I present you with the Case of the Officers of Excise. A
   compliment of this kind from an entire stranger may appear somewhat
   singular, but the following reasons and information will, I presume,
   sufficiently apologize. I act myself in the humble station of an officer
   of excise, though somewhat differently circumstanced to what many of them
   are, and have been the principal promoter of a plan for applying to
   Parliament this session for an increase of salary. A petition for this
   purpose has been circulated through every part of the kingdom, and signed
   by all the officers therein. A subscription of three shillings per officer
   is raised, amounting to upwards of -L-500, for supporting the expenses.
   The excise officers, in all cities and corporate towns, have obtained
   letters of recommendation from the electors to the members in their
   behalf, many or most of whom have promised their support. The enclosed
   case we have presented to most of the members, and shall to all, before
   the petition appears in the Houses. The memorial before you met with so
   much approbation while in manuscript, that I was advised to print 4000
   copies; 3000 of which were subscribed for the officers in general, and the
   remaining 1000 reserved for presents. Since the delivering them I have
   received so many letters of thanks and approbation for the performance,
   that were I not rather singularly modest, I should insensibly become a
   little vain. The literary fame of Dr. Goldsmith has induced me to present
   one to him, such as it is. It is my first and only attempt, and even now I
   should not have undertaken it, had I not been particularly applied to by
   some of my superiors in office. I have some few questions to trouble Dr.
   Goldsmith with, and should esteem his company for an hour or two, to
   partake of a bottle of wine, or anything else, and apologize for this
   trouble, as a singular favor conferred on

   His unknown Humble servant and admirer,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. Shall take the liberty of waiting on you in a day or two.
