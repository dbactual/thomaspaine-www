   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   I will be obliged to you to send back the Models, as I am packing up to
   set-off to Philadelphia and N York. My intention in bringing them here
   in preference to sending them from Baltimore to Philadelphia, was, to have
   some conversation with you on those matters and others I have not informed
   you of. But you have not only shewn no disposition towards it, but have,
   in some measure, by a sort of shyness, as if you stood in fear of federal
   observation, precluded it. I am not the only one, who makes observations
   of this kind.

   Thomas Paine
   
   Janry 12 1803
