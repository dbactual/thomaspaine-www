   To Thomas Jefferson January 12, 1803

   I will be obliged to you to send back the Models, as I am packing up to
   set off to Philadelphia and New York. My intentions in bringing them here
   in preference to sending them from Baltimore to Philadelphia, was, to have
   some conversation with you on those matters and others I have not informed
   you of. But you have not only shown no disposition towards it, but have,
   in some measure, by a sort of shyness, as if you stood in fear of federal
   observation, precluded it. I am not the only one, who makes observations
   of this kind.

   THOMAS PAINE.
