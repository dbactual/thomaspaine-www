   Commissioner from Congress at Paris
   
   Philadelphia July 9th. 1777

   My Dear Sir

   The dispatches being made up yesterday I herewith inclose you the papers
   of last night and this morning. General Howe, by every preparation, is
   about leaving N. York as he has already retreated from the Army which
   it was his business to conquer, it is impossible to say what may be his
   next movement, some suppose the North River to effect a junction with
   Burgoyne. But there are ,I think, too many reasons against this Project;
   one of which is, that as they have no other army than this, they are
   obliged to make use of it as an Army of Observation on the motions of the
   French and Spaniards in the West Indies, and for that reason will, If they
   have any desention, keep it somewhere about the Coast: another objection
   against the North River is, the leaving our Army and a River of near 150
   Miles in their rear, which Circumstances render the safe return of their
   fleet a matter of great doubt, and any considerable damage done to them in
   that Quarter would be like wounding an Eagle in the Wing. Mr. Gross in his
   English Antiquities mentions fire Arrows being used for disabling or
   destroyed fleets but the Extract, which I have seen, gives me no
   description how the Machine was constructed by which they were thrown. He
   says Sir Richard Hawkins did incredible damage to the whole Squadron of
   Spanish Men of War on the Coast of Peru, and that admiral Watson in the
   East Indies last War used them in an engagement with Mons. D Ache, with
   great Success.

   I have made a draft of a Bow, something on the Plan of the Steel Cross by 
   which will throw an Iron Arrow across the Delaware. I purpose, enclosing 
   the fire in a bulb near the Top. I have shewn it to Mr. Rittenhouse who joins me in getting one made for
   experiment.

   (DRAWING OMITTED)

   General Howe will probably give an Air to this retreat from the Jersies by
   saying that he endeavored in vain to bring General Washington to a General
   Action. If this reason be admitted it proves the Impossibility of his ever
   Conquering. The fact, however, is this. General Washington does not
   *immediately* Command much more than half the Army, and could General Howe
   with his whole force bring General Washington to an Action with little
   more than half he would have done it. But whenever the latter collects
   his whole force together, either to receive or attack General Howe, he
   leaves the field to him.

   In my former I informed you of my being appointed Secretary to the
   Committee for foreign Affairs, and requested you to send me the Reviews,
   Gentlemans and Universal Magazines and Parliamentary Registers for 74.
   75. 76 and that I would account for them to Mr. Beach. Lest that
   letter should miscarry I renew my request in this, with any such other
   Pieces as you may be so kind as to favor me with. I intend towards the
   latter End of the Year to send for your approbation the plan on which I
   intend to conduct the History of this Revolution.

   I am Dear Sir with every wish for your health and happiness Your Obliged
   Humble Servant

   Please to present my best respects to Your worthy Colleagues.
