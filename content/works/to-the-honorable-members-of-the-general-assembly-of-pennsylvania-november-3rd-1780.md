   To the Honorable Members of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania  November
   3rd, 1780.

   GENTLEMEN :

   I informed the members of the last House by letter of the 14th of
   September, that, as it was my intention to collect materials for a history
   of the Revolution it would be impossible for me to attend the duty of
   Clerk of the House, as no order was then taken on the letter. I have now
   the honor of repeating the same to this Honorable House.

   I am Honorable Gentlemen, Your obedient humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
