   To the Honorable Speaker of the House of Representatives  March 7, 1808

   NEW YORK,

   SIR:

   I wrote you a week ago, prior to the date of this letter, respecting my
   memorial to Congress, but I have not yet seen an account of any
   proceedings upon it.

   I know not who the Committee of Claims are, but if they are men of younger
   standing than "the times that tried men's souls," and, consequently, too
   young to know what the condition of the country was at the time I
   published Common Sense (for I do not believe independence would have been
   declared had it not been for the effect of that work), they are not
   capable of judging of the whole of the services of Thomas Paine. The
   President and Vice President can give you information on those subjects,
   so also can Mr. Smilie, who was a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature
   at the times I am speaking of. He knows the inconveniences I was often put
   to, for the old Congress treated me with ingratitude, they seemed to be
   disgusted at my popularity, and acted towards me as a rival instead of a
   friend.

   The explanation I sent to the committee respecting a resolve of the old
   Congress while they sat at New York should be known to Congress, but it
   seems to me that the committee keep everything to themselves, and do
   nothing. If my memorial was referred to the Committee of Claims, for the
   purpose of losing it, it is unmanly policy. After so many years of service
   my heart grows cold towards America.

   Yours, in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. I repeat my request, that you would call on the Committee of Claims
   to bring in their report, and that Congress would decide upon it.
