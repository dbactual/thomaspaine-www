   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   London Fryday, Sepr. 18, 1789.

   Dear Sir

   I this moment received yours of 7, 13 Inst. which being Past night, affords
   me the welcome opportunity of acknowledging it &mdash; I wrote you on the 13th 
   by post &mdash; but I was so full of the thoughts of America and my American 
   friends that I forgot France &mdash; The people of this Country speak very 
   differently on the affairs of France &mdash; The Mass of them so far as I can 
   collect say that France is a much freer Country than England &mdash; The 
   Press, the Bishops &c says the National assembly has gone too far &mdash; 
   There is yet in this Country very considerable remains of the feudal System 
   which people did not see till the revolution in France placed it before their 
   Eyes, while the multitude here could be terrified with the cry and 
   apprehension of Arbitrary power, wooden shoes, popery, and such like stuff 
   &mdash; they thought themselves by comparison a extraordinary free people 
   &mdash; but the bug-bear now loses its force &mdash; and they appear to me to 
   be turning their eyes &mdash; toward the aristocrats of their own nation 
   &mdash; There is a new mode of conquering and I think it will have its effect.
   
   &mdash; I am looking out for a place to erect my Bridge within some of the
   Squares would be very convenient. I had thought of Soho Square, where S.
   Joseph Banks lives, but he is now in Lancashire &mdash; I expect it will be 
   ready for erecting and in London, by the latter end of October &mdash; whether 
   I shall then sell it in England or bring it over to Paris and erect it there 
   I have not determined in my mind &mdash; in order to bring any kind of 
   Contract forward for the Seine it is necessary it should be seen &mdash; and 
   as Oeconomy will now be a principle in the government it will have a better 
   chance than before.

   If you should pass through Borden Town in Jersey which is not out of your
   way from Philadelphia to N Y &mdash; I shall be glad you would enquire
   out my particular friend Col. Kirkbride &mdash; you will be very much pleased
   with him &mdash; his house is my hearth in that part of the Country &mdash; 
   and it was there that I made the model of my Bridge &mdash; If you can drop me 
   a line when at the port to inform me by what vessel you sail &mdash; I shall 
   be glad to receive it &mdash;

   Your affectionate friend,

   THOMAS PAINE
