   Harve May 14th - 97

   Dear Sir

   I wrote to you by the ship Dublin Packet - Capt. Clay, mentioning my
   intention to have returned to America by that Vessel, and to have
   suggested to some Member of the house of representatives the propriety of
   calling Mr. Monroe before them to have enquired into the state of their
   Affairs in France. This might have laid the foundation for some resolves
   on their part that might have led to an accommodation with france, for
   that house is the only part of the American Governt. that have any
   reputation here. I apprised Mr. Monroe of my design and he wishes to be
   called up. &mdash; You will have heard before this reaches you that the Emperor 
   has been obliged to sue for peace, and to consent to the establishment of the 
   new republic in Lombardy - How france will proceed with respect to England, I
   am not, at this distance from Paris, in the way of knowing, but am
   inclined to think she meditates a descent upon that Country, and a
   revolution in its Governt. If this should be the plan, it will keep me
   in Europe at least another year.

   As the british party has thrown the American Commerce into wretched
   Confusion, it is necessary to pay more attention to the appointment of
   Consuls in the ports of france, than there was occasion to do in time of
   peace, especially as there is now no Minister, and Mr. Skipwith, who stood
   well with the Government here, has resigned - Mr. Cutting, the Consul for
   Havre, does not reside at it - And the business is altogether in the hands
   of De la Motte, the Vice Consul, who is a frenchman, cannot have the
   full authority proper for the office in the difficult state matters are
   now in - I do not mention this to the disadvantage of Mr. Cutting for no
   man is more proper than himself if he thought it an object to attend to.

   &mdash; I know not if you are acquainted with Capt. Johnson of Massachusetts - 
   he is a staunch man and one of the oldest American Captains in the American
   Employ. He is now settled at Havre and is a more proper man for a Vice
   Consul than La Motte - You can learn his character from Mr. Monroe - He has
   written to some of his friends to have the appointment, and if you can see
   an opportunity of throwing in a little service for him, you will do a good
   thing. 
   
   We have had several reports of Mr. Madison's coming - He would be
   well received as an individual - but as an Envoy of John Adams he could do
   nothing -
