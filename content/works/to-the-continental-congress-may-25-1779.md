   To the Continental Congress  May 25, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   On the 20th inst. I applied to Congress for such parts of Mr. Deane's
   Narrative and subsequent letters as refer to me personally or to the
   Publication signed Common Sense of which I am the author to which request
   I have received no answer.

   I have strong reasons to suspect that Mr. Deane in his former official
   capacity as Agent and Commissioner from the United States, has been
   dishonest, that: he has defrauded the Public, and that he has embezzled or
   is privy to the embezzling the public dispatches and that conscious

   of his crime he is seeking shelter, directly or indirectly among his
   advocates in this House. I therefore request that my application for
   copies of his Narrative and letters may be granted to me or refused me.

   THOMAS PAINE.
