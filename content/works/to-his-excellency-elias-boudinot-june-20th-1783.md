   To his Excellency Elias Boudinot  June 20th, 1783

   PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS

   SECOND STREET,

   SIR:

   As the enclosed letter relates to an important national subject and
   conveys some information and touches on circumstances which may be
   improved into a foundation of revenue to the States both collectively and
   individually, I do myself the honor of presenting Congress with the
   perusal of it. It came to me yesterday by vessel from Bristol, and I
   observe is per favor of Mr. Cruger.

   The place it is dated from, Salisbury (in Wiltshire) is one of the best
   farming countries in England.

   I am your Excellency's obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
