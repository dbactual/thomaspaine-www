   From the original letter at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

   Dear Sir
   
   Philadelphia June 30th 1783

   As you have Congress, and consequently all the news and politics, in the
   Jersies, you will not expect anything very important from this side the
   Delaware. We have a report brought by vessel from Granada, of the
   assassination of the Stat-holder and the Duke of Brunswick, but as it is
   among the common rumors of the day, I would not wish to be quoted as the
   news-monger of the report.

   The particular occasion of my writing to you is on a matter in which I
   have no other concern than friendship, and a wish to prevent
   inconveniences and mistake.

   Mr. Harris, I find, has notice that some other person is coming into the
   house he now lives in, yet the affair is so wrapt in obscurity, that
   nobody appears to have any direct business with it; and at last I find
   that the woman, next door Mrs. Harris, is a principal manager in it.

   That the owner of a House has a right to let it to whom he pleases,
   every body will admit, but it is one of those kind of rights which in the
   exercise of it, is so governed by the laws of Civility and Society, that a
   tenant never expects to have it let over his head. I have several times
   heard Mr. Harris mention, that he expected either yourself or some of your
   family to come into it, which would occasion his moving. But the present
   notice arises from a different cause and appears to me to be affected by
   the busy interposition of an ill natured neighbor, who, I can assure you,
   delights in noise and contention: thus I cannot help saying because I am
   too near not to be a judge of characters.

   As the last half year has been very much against the shop-keepers, they
   certainly are entitled, on the principles of Equity, to every
   consideration which a Landlord can give them. A man when he buys a stock
   of goods has an Idea of a place to sell them in, otherwise he would not
   buy them, and his removal is a very different thing to that of a person
   out of trade.

   But I need not mention these things to you who know them much better than
   myself &mdash; The person who was expecting to come in has, perhaps, from an
   apprehension that there is something uncivil at the bottom of the affair,
   signified an inclination to decline it &mdash; And Mr. Stamper, as I am told has
   spoken of it as a proceeding he should not have chosen to have had any
   concern in &mdash; Now if the person next door has been acting a busy
   unneighborly part (which I think her very capable of doing) you will not
   take it unfriendly in me in signifying my opinion to you, because while I
   would, on the one hand, wish to prevent an unnecessary or disagreeable
   removal to Mr. Harris, I am inclined by frienship to you to explain such of the
   circumstances as has come to my knowledge.

   Mr. Harris has written to your father on the affair, and as it does not appear to
   me that there is any thing finally concluded on, (tho' it is likely that
   the removal of Congress from Philadelphia may occasion some hesitation in
   newcomers at the present rents) I have seconded his letter with a wish to
   explain and settle the matter, and if there is no absolute occasion for
   her immediate removal, which I imagine there is not, that you would enter
   with your father and mother on the subject with the same ideas on the
   matter as if you were a tenant yourself.

   I am with Compl to Mrs. Wallace and your family your affectionate
   friend and obt Hble Serv

   THOMAS PAINE
