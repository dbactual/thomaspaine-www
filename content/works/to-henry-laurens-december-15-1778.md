   To Henry Laurens  December 15, 1778

   PHILADELPHIA,.

   DEAR SIR:

   In this morning's paper is a piece addressed to Mr. Deane, in which your
   name is mentioned. My intention in relating the circumstances with which
   it is connected is to prevent the enemy drawing any unjust conclusions
   from an accidental division in the House on matters no ways political. You
   will please to observe that I have been exceedingly careful to preserve
   the honor of Congress in the minds of the people who have been so
   exceedingly fretted by Mr. Deane's address, and this will appear the more
   necessary when I inform you that a proposal has been made for calling a
   Town Meeting to demand justice for Mr. Deane. I have been applied to
   smoothly and roughly not to publish this piece. Mr. Deane has likewise
   been with the printer.

   I am, etc,

   THOMAS PAINE.
