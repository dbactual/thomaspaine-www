   From the 1793 pamphlet from London reprinting King's letter and Paine's response below.

   DEAR KING,

   I don't know any thing, these many years, that surprised and hurt me more
   than the sentiments you published in the Courtly HERALD, the 12th
   December, signed John King, *Egham Lodge*. You have gone back, from all you
   ever said. 
   
   When I first knew you in Ailiffe-street, an obscure part of the
   City, a child, without fortune or friends, I noticed you; because I
   thought I saw in you, young as you was, a bluntness of temper, a boldness
   of opinion, and an originality of thought, that portended some future
   good. 
   
   I was pleased to discuss with you, under our friend *Oliver's* lime-tree, 
   those political notions, which I have since given the
   world in my "Rights of Man".

   You used to complain of abuses as well as me, and wrote your opinions of them 
   in sore terms &mdash; What then means this
   sudden attachment to *Kings*? this fondness of the English Government, and
   hatred of the French? &mdash; If you mean to curry favour, by aiding your
   Government, you are mistaken; they never recompense those who serve it;
   they buy off those who can annoy it, and let the good that is rendered it
   be its own reward. Believe me, KING, more is to be obtained by cherishing
   the rising spirit of the People, than by subduing it. Follow my fortunes,
   and I will be answerable that you shall make your own.

   THO. PAINE.
   
   *Paris, January* 3, 1793.
