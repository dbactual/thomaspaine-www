   Philip Foner's introduction:

   A few weeks after the announcement of the Declaration of Independence,
   Paine enlisted in the army, serving until April, 1777. During the retreat
   of Washington's forces from New York through New Jersey, he wrote by
   campfire the first sixteen pamphlets issued at each critical point in the
   struggle for independence. The following article, which appeared in the
   Pennsylvania Journal of January 29, 1777, makes no mention of the fact
   that the author's The American Crisis, signed "Common Sense," inspired the
   victory of the Continentals at Trenton. It is an excellent example of
   objective reporting by an early American war-correspondent.

   FORT WASHINGTON being obliged to surrender, by a violent attack made by
   the whole British army, on Saturday the 16th of November, the Generals
   determined to evacuate Fort Lee, which being principally intended to
   preserve the communication with Fort Washington, was become in a manner
   useless. The stores were ordered to be removed and great part of them was
   immediately sent off. The enemy knowing the divided state of our army, and
   that the terms of the soldiers' enlistments would soon expire, conceived
   the design of penetrating into the Jerseys, and hoped, by pushing their
   successes, to be completely victorious. Accordingly, on Wednesday morning,
   the 20th November, it was discovered that a large body of British and
   Hessian troops had crossed the North River, and landed about six miles
   above the fort. As our force was inferior to that of the enemy, the fort
   unfinished, and on a narrow neck of land, the garrison was ordered to
   march for Hackensack bridge, which, though much nearer the enemy than the
   fort, they quietly suffered our troops to take possession of. The
   principal loss suffered at Fort Lee was that of the heavy cannon, the
   greatest part of which was left behind. Our troops continued at Hackensack
   bridge and town that day and half of the next, when the inclemency of the
   weather, the want of quarters, and approach of the enemy, obliged them to
   proceed to Aquaconack, and from thence to Newark; a party being left at
   Aquaconack to observe the motions of the enemy. At Newark our little army
   was reinforced by Lord Sterling's and Colonel Hand's brigades, which had
   been stationed at Brunswick. Three days after our troops left Hackensack,
   a body of the enemy crossed the Passaic above Aquaconack, made their
   approaches slowly towards Newark, and seemed extremely desirous that we
   should leave the town without their being put to the trouble of fighting
   for it. The distance from Newark to Aquaconack is nine miles, and they
   were three days in marching that distance. From Newark our retreat was to
   Brunswick, and it was hoped the assistance of the Jersey Militia would
   enable General Washington to make the Banks of the Raritan the bounds of
   the enemy's progress; but on the 1st of December the army was greatly
   weakened, by the expiration of the terms of the enlistments of the
   Maryland and Jersey Flying Camp; and the militia not coming in so soon as
   was expected, another retreat was the necessary consequence. Our army
   reached Trenton on the 4th of December, continued there till the 7th, and
   then, on the approach of the enemy, it was thought proper to pass the
   Delaware.

   This retreat was censured by some as pusillanimous and disgraceful; but,
   did they know that our army was at one time less than a thousand effective
   men, and never more than 4000,-that the number of the enemy was at least
   8000, exclusive of their artillery and light horse,-that this handful of
   Americans retreated slowly above 80 miles without losing a dozen men-and
   that suffering themselves to be forced to an action, would have been their
   entire destruction-did they know this, they would never have censured it
   at all-they would have called it prudent -posterity will call it
   glorious-and the names of Washington and Fabius will run parallel to
   eternity.1

   The enemy, intoxicated with success, resolved to enjoy the fruits of their
   conquest. Fearless of an attack from this side the river, they cantoned in
   parties at a distance from each other, and spread misery and desolation
   wherever they went. Their rage and lust, their avarice and cruelty, knew
   no bounds; and murder, ravishment, plunder, and the most brutal treatment
   of every sex and age, were the first acts that signalized their conquest.
   And if such were their outrages on the partial subjection of a few
   villages-good God! what consummate wretchedness is in store for that state
   over which their power shall be fully established.

   While the enemy were in this situation, their security was increased by
   the captivity of General Lee, who was unfortunately taken in the rear of
   his army, December 13th, at Baskinridge by a party of lighthorse,
   commanded by Colonel Harcourt. The fortune of our arms was now at its
   lowest ebb-but the tide was beginning to turn-the militia of this city
   [Philadelphia] had joined General Washington-the junction of the two
   armies was soon after effected-and the back countries of this State,
   aroused by the distresses of America, poured out their yeomanry to the
   assistance of the continental army. General Washington began now to have a
   respectable force, and resolved not to be idle. On the 26th of December he
   crossed the Delaware, surprised three regiments of Hessians, and with
   little or no loss, took near a thousand prisoners.2

   Soon after this maneuver, and while the enemy were collecting their
   scattered troops at Princeton and Brunswick, General Washington crossed
   the Delaware with all his army. On the 2d of January the enemy began to
   advance towards Trenton, which they entered in the afternoon, and there
   being nothing but a small creek between the two armies, a general
   engagement was expected next day. This it was manifestly our advantage to
   avoid; and by a master stroke of generalship, General Washington freed
   himself from his disgreeable situation, and surprised a party of the enemy
   in Princeton, which obliged their main body to return to Brunswick.

   1.  Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, named Cunctator, "the delayer," was a Roman
   general who practiced a delaying tactic in the second Punic War. It was
   Washington's patient vigilance that earned him the title of
   "Fabius."-Editor.

   2. At this point in the narrative, the editor of the Pennsylvania Journal
   inserted Washington's letter to the Continental Congress, December 27,
   1776. Towards the end of the letter, Washington wrote: "In justice to the
   Officers and Men, I must add, that their Behavior upon this Occasion,
   reflects the highest honor upon them. The difficulty of passing the River
   in a very severe Night, and their march through a violent Storm of Snow
   and Hail, did not in the least abate their Ardour. . . ."-Editor.
