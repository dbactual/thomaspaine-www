   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This paper appears in the French State Archives, and is endorsed "January
   1793. Thomas Payne. Copie." The date is erroneous, for the reference to
   the defeat of the Duke of York at Dunkirk indicates that it was written
   during the late summer or early fall of 1793. The Duke of York set out to
   capture Dunkirk in the late spring of 1793.

   The paper is printed from a photostatic copy of the French manuscript
   through the courtesy of the Library of Congress.

   IT is always useful to know the" position and the designs of one's
   enemies. It is much easier to do so by combining and comparing the events,
   and by examining the consequences which result from them, than by forming
   one's judgment by letters found or intercepted. These letters could be
   fabricated with the intention of deceiving, but events or circumstances
   have a character which is proper to them. If in the course of our
   political operations we mistake the designs of our enemy, it leads us to
   do precisely that .which he desired we should do, and it happens, by the
   fact, but against our intentions, that we work for him.

   It appears at first sight that the coalition against France is not of the
   nature of those which form themselves by a treaty. It has been the work of
   circumstances. It is a heterogeneous mass, the parts of which dash against
   each other, and often neutralize themselves. They have but one single
   point of reunion, the re-establishment of the monarchical government in
   France. Two means can conduct them to the execution of this plan. The
   first is, to re-establish the Bourbons, and with them the Monarchy; the
   second, to make a division similar to that which they have made in Poland,
   and to reign themselves in France. The political questions to be solved
   are, then, to know on which of these two plans it is most probable, the
   united Powers will act; and which are the points of these plans on which
   they will agree or disagree.

   Supposing their aim to be the re-establishment of the Bourbons, the
   difficulty which will present itself, will be, to know who will be their
   Allies?

   Will England consent to the re-establishment of the compact of family in
   the person of the Bourbons, against whom she has machinated and fought
   since her existence? Will Prussia consent to re-establish the alliance
   which subsisted between France and Austria, or will Austria wish to
   re-establish the ancient alliance between France and Prussia, which was
   directed against her? Will Spain, or any other maritime Power, allow
   France and her Marine to ally themselves to England ? In fine, will any of
   these Powers consent to furnish forces which could be directed against
   herself? However, all these cases present themselves in the hypothesis of
   the restoration of the Bourbons.

   If we suppose that their plan be the dismemberment of France, difficulties
   will present themselves under another form, but not of the same nature. It
   will no longer be a question, in this case, of the Bourbons, as their
   position will be worse; for if their preservation is a part of their first
   plan, their destruction ought to enter in the second; because it is
   necessary for the success of the dismembering that not a single pretendant
   to the Crown of France should exist.

   As one must think of all the probabilities in political calculations, it
   is not unlikely that some of the united Powers, having in view the first
   of these plans, and others the second,-that this may be one of the causes
   of their disagreement. It is to be remembered that Russia recognized a
   Regency from the beginning of Spring; not one of the other Powers followed
   her example. The distance of Russia from France, and the different
   countries by which she is separated from her, leave no doubt as to her
   dispositions with regard to the plan of division; and as much as one can
   form an opinion on the circumstances, it is not her scheme.

   The coalition directed against France, is composed of two kinds of Powers.
   The Maritime Powers, not having the same interest as the others, will be
   divided, as to the execution of the project of division.

   I do not hesitate to believe that the politic of the English Government is
   to foment the scheme of dismembering, and the entire destruction of the
   Bourbon family.

   The difficulty which must arise, in this last hypothesis, between the
   united Maritime Powers proceeds from their views being entirely opposed.

   The trading vessels of the Northern Nations, from Holland to Russia, must
   pass through the narrow Channel, which lies between Dunkirk and the coasts
   of England; and consequently not one of them, will allow this latter Power
   to have forts on both sides of this Strait. The audacity with which she
   has seized the neutral vessels ought to demonstrate to all Nations how
   much her schemes increase their danger, and menace the security of their
   present and future commerce.

   Supposing then that the other Nations oppose the plans of England, she
   will be forced to cease the war with us; or, if she continues it, the
   Northern Nations will become interested in the safety of France.

   There are three distinct parties in England at this moment: the Government
   party, the Revolutionary party, and an intermedial party, which is only
   opposed to the war on account of the expense it entails, and the harm it
   does commerce and manufacture. I am speaking of the People, and not of the
   Parliament. The latter is divided into two parties : the Ministerial and
   the Anti-Ministerial. The Revolutionary party, the intermedial party and
   the Anti-Ministerial party will all rejoice, publicly or privately, at the
   defeat of the Duke of York's army at Dunkirk. The intermedial party,
   because they hope that this defeat will finish the war. The
   Anti-Ministerial party, because they hope it will overthrow the Ministry.
   And all the three because they hate the Duke of York. Such is the state of
   the different parties in England.
