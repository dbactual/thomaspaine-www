   To the Continental Congress August 18, 1785

   NEW YORK,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   As it is my intention after an absence of now almost eleven years to
   return to Europe, as soon as I have regulated my private affairs which
   will be in about two months, and as it is my wish to prevent any wrong
   impressions taking place either in my own mind, or in the mind of others,
   respecting my conduct towards America or hers to me in return, I am
   desirous before my departure to place sundry matters before Congress in
   which the honor and interest of Congress and their constituents, as well
   as my own reputation are concerned.

   I do therefore request, that I may be admitted to communicate to Congress,
   or to a Committee thereof, the sundry matters I allude to and be
   personally examined touching the same.

   THOMAS PAINE.
