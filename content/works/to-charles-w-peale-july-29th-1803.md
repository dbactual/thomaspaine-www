   From the original letter at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.
   
   Bordenton - July 29th - 1803

   Dear friend -

   I received your favour per packet. I enclose you the invoice. The two long
   cases 2 & 3 contain the models of the Bridge - These I wish you to open.
   The one is a model in paste-board, the other, in cast metal. They are made
   fast in the cases by screws in the sides near to the bottom. The screws
   must be drawn before the models can be lifted out. The other cases contain
   tools and instruments which need not be opened. Please to preserve the
   screws and the cases, as they will be wanted when the model be removed.
   The model to be viewed in a proper position should be placed as high as
   the eye. With respect to the Schuylkill Bridge it should have been
   constructed in a single arch. It would then have been an honour to the
   state.

   Yours in friendship

   Thomas Paine

   Please to pay the Petl (?) the Expenses and send me an account of it -
