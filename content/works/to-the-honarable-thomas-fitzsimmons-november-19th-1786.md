   To the Honarable Thomas Fitzsimmons  November 19th, 1786

   BORDENTOWN,

   SIR:

   I write you a few loose thoughts as they occur to me. Next to gaining a
   majority is keeping it. This, at least (in my opinion), will not be best
   accomplished by doing or attempting a great deal of business, but by doing
   no more than is absolutely necessary to be done, acting moderately and
   giving no offence. It is with the whole as it is with the members
   individually, and we always see at every new election that it is more
   difficult to turn out an old member against whom no direct complaint can
   be made than it is to put in a new one though a better man. I am sure it
   will be best not to touch any part of the plan of finance this year. If it
   falls short, as most probably it will, it would be (I speak for myself)
   best to reduce the interest that the whole body of those who are styled
   public creditors may share it equally as far as it will go. If anything
   can be saved from the Civil List expenses it ought not to be finally
   mortgaged to make up the deficiency; it may be applied to bring the
   creditors to a balance for the present year. There is more to be said
   respecting this debt than has yet been said. The matter has never been
   taken up but by those who are interested in the matter. The public has
   been deficient and the claimants exorbitant-neglect on one side and
   greediness on the other. That which is truly Justice may be always
   advocated. But I could no more think of paying six per cent interest in
   real money, in perpetuity, for a debt a great part of which is quondam
   than I could think of not paying at all. Six per cent on any part of the
   debt, even to the original holders is ten or twelve per cent, and to the
   speculators twenty or thirty or more. It is better that the matter rest
   until it is fuller investigated and better understood, for in its present
   state it will be hazardous to touch upon.

   I have not heard a word of news from Philadelphia since I came to this
   place. I wrote a line to Mr. Francis and desired him to give me a little
   account of matters but he does not, perhaps, think it very necessary now.

   I see by the papers that the subject of the Bank is likely to be renewed.
   I should like to know when it will come on, as I have some thought of
   coming down at that time, if I can.

   I see by the papers that the Agricultural Society has presented a petition
   to the House respecting building a bridge over the Schuylkill-on a model
   prepared for that purpose. In this I think they are too hasty. I have
   already constructed a model of a bridge of cast iron, consisting of one
   arch. I am now making another of wrought iron of one arch, but on a
   different plan. I expect to finish it in about three weeks and shall send
   it first to Philadelphia. I have no opinion of any bridge over the
   Schuylkill that is to be erected on piers-the sinking of piers will sink
   more money than they have any idea of and will not stand when done. But
   there is another point they have not taken into their consideration; which
   is, that the sinking three piers in the middle of the river, large and
   powerful enough to resist the ice, will cause such an alteration in the
   bed and channel of the river that there is no saying what course it may
   take, or whether it will not force a new channel somewhere else.

   THOMAS PAINE.
