   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.
   
   Dear Sir

   Borden Town June 6th 1786
   
   The gentleman, Mr. Hall, who presents you with this letter, has the Care
   of two models for a Bridge, one of wood, the other of cast Iron, which I
   have the pleasure of submitting to you, as well for the purposes of
   shewing my respect to you, as my patron in this Country as for the sake of
   having your opinion and Judgment thereon.

   The European method of Bridge Architecture, by piers and Arches, is not
   adapted to the condition of many of the Rivers in America on account of
   the Ice in the winter. &mdash; The Construction of those I have the honor of
   presenting to you is designed to obviate that difficulty by leaving the
   whole passage of the River clear of the incumbrance of Piers. 
   
   The Wooden
   Model was the first executed. The Timbers are an Inch square, and twelve
   inches and a half long, the extent of the model is thirteen feet, and the
   height of the Arch about a twenty eighth part of the length of the chord. 
   &mdash; It is made of cherry tree which is not a very strong wood. 
   What weight it
   will bear, as it cannot be ascertained without breaking it, I am unwilling
   to put to an experiment. Four men have been on it at one time, without the
   least injury to it, or signs of any.

   The objections against the wooden model are the compressibility and
   perishableness of the Material. The ends of the Timber by continually
   pressing against each other will in time diminish something in their
   length either by splitting up or wearing away. 
   
   The Iron Model is intended
   to obviate those objections. Tho' the principle is the same as in the
   other, the preparations and dimensions are not exactly the same. The least
   angle in the wooden Model is a right angle, and the greatest angle in the
   Iron one is about 88 degrees, and the height of the Arch is a sixteenth
   part of the length of its chord which is twelve feet.

   It does not appear to me, that increasing the height of the Arch is an
   advantage, on the Contrary I think it a disadvantage. Whatever the chord,
   may be, I should prefer making the height of the arch about a 1/22 part of
   it.

   My first design in the Wooden Model was for a Bridge over the Harlem River
   for my good friend General Morris of Morrisania. It is made on a Scale of
   one to twenty four, that is, the Timbers being increased twenty four the
   length of those in the Model, the same Number of Angles (nine) substituted
   in the room of Arches, would extend across that river, which is three
   hundred feet.

   It would be tedious in a letter to give you all the observations that have
   occurred to me in the progress of putting the parts together in the two
   Models. &mdash; As to what may be the best angle, or the best 
   proportions of the
   several parts I do not undertake to decide. The longer the legs are the
   fewer (of consequence) will be the number of the Angles, and the shorter
   the most; but neither case, if the same Angle be used, the quantity of
   Timber or Iron will be nearly the same, for the eighteen legs which
   compose each side of either of the Bridges are only equal to one angle
   whose base would be the extent of the length of the Bridge. Therefore as
   the quantity of Timber or Iron will be nearly the same in a greater or
   less number of Angles for any given length the only consideration is the
   relative proportion.

   To what extent, on a great Work, such a construction of a Bridge can be
   carried, is what I am unwilling to venture too much opinion on; but I
   cannot help thinking that it might be carried across the Schuylkill. On
   the proportions I have mentioned it would have an elevation of about
   twenty feet in the Center, but it might be made either more or less.

   As I do not think it possible for any Bridge constructed with Piers to
   withstand the Ice which comes down that River in some winters, there
   appears to me no hope of a permanent Bridge unless it can be carried clear
   across. &mdash; A floating Bridge at all times obstruct 
   the Navigation, and in
   winter, when a Bridge is most wanted, is often of no use; and frequently
   carried away by driving Ice. But could a Bridge be erected on the plan of
   the Iron Model, it would exceedingly benefit the City and Country, and
   besides its usefulness would, I believe, be the most extensive Arch in the
   world, and the longest Bridge without Piers: I should therefore wish to
   see it undertaken and performed during your Presidency, as any share I
   might have therein would be greatly heightened by that Circumstance, but
   of this, and other matters relating thereto I reserve myself till I have
   the honor of seeing you which I hope will be on Thursday, in the mean time,
   Mr. Hall, who has been with me at Borden Town, and has done the chief share
   of the working part, for we have done the whole ourselves, will inform you
   of any Circumstance relating to it which does not depend on the
   mathematical Construction.

   Mr. Hall will undertake to see the Models brought safe from the Stage Boat
   to you, they are too large to be admitted into the house but will stand
   very well in the Garden.

   Should there be a vessel going round to N. York within about a week
   after my arrival at Philadelphia, I shall take that convenience for
   sending them there, at which place I hope to be in about a fort'night.
   &mdash; 

   I am Dear Sir your Affectionate and Obedient Humble Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
