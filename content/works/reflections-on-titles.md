   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This brief essay appeared in the Pennsylvania Magazine of May, 1775. It
   anticipated Paine's remarks on the King of England in Common Sense and his
   more elaborate discussion of the subject of titles in Rights of Man. The
   only ones deserving of titles, Paine argued, was a body of public-spirited
   men who had the welfare of the people in mind. The only titles kings and
   their courtiers were worthy of were such designations as "the Right
   Honorable murderer of mankind."



   Ask me what's honor? I'll the truth impart:

   Know, honor then, is Honesty of Heart.         WHITEHEAD.

   WHEN I reflect on the pompous titles bestowed on unworthy men, I feel an
   indignity that instructs me to despise the absurdity. The Honorable
   plunderer of his country, or the Right Honorable murderer of mankind,
   create such a contrast of ideas as exhibit a monster rather than a man.
   Virtue is inflamed at the violation, and sober reason calls it nonsense.

    Dignities and high sounding names have different effects on different
   beholders. The lustre of the Star and the title of My Lord, overawe the
   superstitious vulgar, and forbid them to inquire into the character of the
   possessor: Nay more, they are, as it were, bewitched to admire in the
   great, the vices they would honestly condemn in themselves. This sacrifice
   of common sense is the certain badge which distinguishes slavery from
   freedom; for when men yield up the privilege of thinking, the last shadow
   of liberty quits the horizon.

    But the reasonable freeman sees through the magic of a title, and
   examines the man before he approves him. To him the honors of the
   worthless serve to write their masters' vices in capitals, and their stars
   shine to no other end than to read them by. The possessors of undue honors
   are themselves sensible of this; for when their repeated guilt renders
   their persons unsafe, they disown their rank, and, like glowworms,
   extinguish themselves into common reptiles, to avoid discovery. Thus
   Jeffries sunk into a fisherman, and his master escaped in the habit of a
   peasant.

   Modesty forbids men, separately or collectively, to assume titles. But as
   all honors, even that of kings, originated from the public, the public may
   justly be called the fountain of true honor. And it is with much pleasure
   I have heard the title of Honorable applied to a body of men, who nobly
   disregarding private ease and interest for public welfare, have justly
   merited the address of The Honorable Continental Congress.

   Vox POPULI.
