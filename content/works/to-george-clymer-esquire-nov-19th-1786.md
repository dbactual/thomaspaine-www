   To George Clymer, Esquire Nov 19th, 1786

   BORDENTOWN,

   SIR:

   I observe by the minutes that the Agricultural Society have presented a
   petition to the House for an act of incorporation for the purpose of
   erecting a bridge over the Schuylkill on a model in their possession. I
   hope this business will not be gone into too hastily. A bridge on piers
   will never answer for that river, they may sink money but they never will
   sink piers that will stand. But admitting that the piers do stand- they
   will cause such an alteration in the bed and channel of the river, as will
   most probably alter its course either to divide the channel, and require
   two bridges or cause it to force a new channel in some other part. It is a
   matter of more hazard than they are aware of the altering by obstructions
   the bed and channel of a river; the water must go somewhere-the force of
   the freshets and the ice is very great now but will be much greater then.

   I am finishing as fast as I can my new model of an iron bridge of one arch
   which if it answers, and I have no doubt but it will, the whole difficulty
   of erecting bridges over that river, or others of like circumstances, will
   be removed, and the expense not greater (and I believe not so great), as
   the sum mentioned by Mr. Morris in the house, and I am sure will stand
   four times as long or as much longer as iron is more durable than wood. I
   mention these circumstances to you that you may be informed of them-and
   not let the matter proceed so far as to put the Agricultural Society in a
   difficult situation at last.

   The giving a Society the exclusive right to build a bridge, unless the
   plan is prepared before hand, will prevent a bridge being built; because
   those who might afterwards produce models preferable to their own, will
   not present them to any such body of men, and they can have no right to
   take other peoples labors or inventions to complete their own undertakings
   by.

   I have not heard any news since I came to this place. I wish you would
   give me a line and let me know how matters are going on. The stage boat
   comes to Bordentown every Wednesday and Sunday from the Crooked Billet
   Wharf.

   THOMAS PAINE.
