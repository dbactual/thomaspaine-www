   THE battles which decided the fate of the King of Prussia and his
   Government, began on the 9th of October, and ended on the 14th of that
   month; but the final event, that of the total overthrow of the Russian
   army of one hundred and fifty thousand men on the 14th, was not known in
   England till the 26th or 27th of October. The first public notice of it is
   in a London paper of the 27th. (See the Mercantile Advertiser of Tuesday,
   Dec. 9th, and American Citizen, Dec. 10th.) The article in the London
   paper of the 27th, which announces this event, begins as follows:

   "London, Oct. 27.- It is with very great concern that we are obliged to
   check the pleasing expectations that were entertained YESTERDAY of the
   success of the Prussian army."

   The manifesto and declaration of the English Government on the failure of
   the negotiation for peace with France, and which throws all the blame of
   that failure on the French Government, was published in the London Gazette
   (the official paper of the English Government) on the 21st of October,
   five or six days before that Government knew of the overthrow of the
   Prussians. Query.-Would the English Government have published that
   manifesto had it been kept back till after the overthrow of the Prussians
   were known? I think not, unless it be true which fanatics have formerly
   said, that "those whom God intends to destroy he first renders mad."

   It is a saying often verified by experience, that one story is good till
   another is told. In a little time we shall have the manifesto of the
   French Government, and then, by comparing the two with each other, and
   with such circumstances as are known, which is the only true way of
   interpreting manifestoes, we shall be enabled to form some judgment of the
   whole.

   But as far as circumstances are already known, Bonaparte has done exactly
   what I would have done myself, with respect I mean to the present war, had
   I been in his place, which, thank God, I am not. Why are coalitions
   continually formed and forming against him, against the French nation, and
   the French Government? Or why does the Government of England oppress and
   impoverish the people it governs by loading them with the burdensome
   expence of paying those coalitions? It is they who pay all, and I pity
   them sincerely.

   The opposers of Bonaparte say, "he is a usurper."  The case is, that all
   the kings in Europe are usurpers, and as to hereditary Government, it is a
   succession of usurpers. The present hereditary Government of England is
   derived from the usurper, William of Normandy, who conquered England and
   usurped the Government. If there is any man amongst them all that is less
   a usurper than the rest, it is Bonaparte; for he was elected by the French
   nation to the rank and title he now holds. The others assumed it by the
   sword, or succeeded in consequence of the first usurpation.

   As to the coalitions against France, it is impossible in the nature of
   things they can succeed while the French Government conducts itself with
   the energy and activity it now does. The English Government may amuse
   itself with forming coalitions as long and as often as it pleases, but
   they will all come to the same fatal end. For, in the first place, there
   is no single power on the Continent of Europe that is able to stand
   against France until a coalition army, coming in detachments from
   different and distant parts of Europe, can be collected and formed. And,
   in the second place, those distant detachments of an intended coalition
   army cannot be put in motion for the purpose of assembling somewhere in
   Germany without its being known by the French Government. The case,
   therefore, will always be, that as soon as the French Government knows
   that those distant parts are in motion, the French army, with Bonaparte at
   its head, will march and attack the first part of the coalition army he
   can come up with, and overthrow it. Last year that part was Austria. This
   year it is Prussia. The English Government may vote coalition armies in
   the cabinet, but Bonaparte can always prevent them in the field. This is a
   matter so very obvious to any man who knows the scene of Europe, and can
   calculate the probability of events, that a Cabinet must be sunk in total
   ignorance and stupidity not to see it; and thus it is that the lives of
   unoffending men are sported away.

   As to the late negotiation for peace between England and France, I view it
   as a trick of war on both sides, and the contest was which could outwit
   the other. The British manifesto says, "The negotiation originated in an
   offer made by the French Government of treating for peace on the basis of
   actual possession." Well! be it so; it makes the matter neither better nor
   worse; for the fact is, though the British manifesto says nothing about
   it, that the British Cabinet had planned, and was forming this coalition
   army of Prussians, Russians, and Swedes, several months before that offer
   was made, and the French Government had knowledge of it, for it is
   impossible to keep such things a dead secret. The French Government,
   therefore, having at least, what may be called suspicious knowledge of
   this coalition intrigue, made the offer to find out the whole of that
   intrigue, that it might be prepared against it. And on the other hand, the
   British Cabinet closed with the offer, and went into the negotiation to
   give time to the Russians and Swedes to march and join the Prussians,
   while the comedy of negotiation was going on.

   But the Corsican usurper, as they call him, has been too quick for them.
   He has outwitted the coalition intriguers, and out-generalled the
   coalition usurpers. The fallen King of Prussia has to deplore his fate,
   and the British Cabinet to dread the consequence.

   In speaking of these circumstances, it ought always to be remembered that
   the British Government began this war. It had concluded a treaty of peace
   with France called the Treaty of Amiens, and soon after, declared war
   again to avoid fulfilling the conditions of that treaty. It will not be
   able to conclude another treaty so good as the treaty it has broken, and
   most probably no treaty at all. That Government must now abide by its
   fate, for it can raise no more coalitions. There does not remain powers on
   the Continent of Europe to form another. The last that could be raised has
   been tried and has perished.
