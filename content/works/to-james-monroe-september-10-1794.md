   To James Monroe  September 10, 1794

   PRISON OF THE LUXEMBOURG,

   I ADDRESS this memorial to you, in consequence of a letter I received from
   a friend, 18 Fructidor (September fourth), in which he says, "Mr. Monroe
   has told me, that he has no orders [meaning from the American Government]
   respecting you; but I am sure he will leave nothing undone to liberate
   you; but, from what I can learn, from all the late Americans, you are not
   considered either by the Government, or by the individuals, as an American
   citizen. You have been made a French citizen, which you have accepted, and
   you have further made yourself a servant of the French Republic; and,
   therefore, it would be out of character for an American Minister to
   interfere in their internal concerns. You must therefore either be
   liberated out of compliment to America, or stand your trial, which you
   have a right to demand."

   This information was so unexpected by me, that I am at a loss how to
   answer it. I know not on what principle it originates; whether from an
   idea that I had voluntarily abandoned my citizenship of America for that
   of France, or from any article of the American Constitution applied to me.
   The first is untrue with respect to any intention on my part; and the
   second is without foundation, as I shall show in the course of this
   memorial.

   The idea of conferring honor of citizenship upon foreigners, who had
   distinguished themselves in propagating the principles of liberty and
   humanity, in opposition to despotism, war and bloodshed, was first
   proposed by me to Lafayette, at the commencement of the French Revolution,
   when his heart appeared to be warmed with those principles. My motive in
   making this proposal, was to render the people of different nations more
   fraternal than they had been, or then were. I observed that almost every
   branch of science had possessed itself of the exercise of this right, so
   far as it regarded its own institution.

   Most of the academies and societies in Europe, and also those of America,
   conferred the rank of honorary member, upon foreigners eminent in
   knowledge, and made them, in fact, citizens of their literary or
   scientific republic, without affecting or anyways diminishing their rights
   of citizenship in their own country or in other societies: and why the
   science of government should not have the same advantage, or why the
   people of one nation should not, by their representatives, exercise the
   right of conferring the honor of citizenship upon individuals eminent in
   another nation, without affecting their rights of citizenship, is a
   problem yet to be solved.

   I now proceed to remark on that part of the letter, in which the writer
   says, that from what he can learn from all the late Americans, I am not
   considered in America, either by the Government or by the individuals, as
   an American citizen.

   In the first place I wish to ask, what is here meant by the Government of
   America? The members who compose the Government are only individuals, when
   in conversation, and who, most probably, hold very different opinions upon
   the subject. Have Congress as a body made any declaration respecting me,
   that they now no longer consider me as a citizen? If they have not,
   anything they otherwise say is no more than the opinion of individuals,
   and consequently is not legal authority, nor anyways sufficient authority
   to deprive any man of his citizenship. Besides, whether a man has
   forfeited his rights of citizenship, is a question not determinable by
   Congress, but by a court of judicature and a jury; and must depend upon
   evidence, and the application of some law or article of the Constitution
   to the case. No such proceeding has yet been had, and consequently I
   remain a citizen until it be had, be that decision what it may; for there
   can be no such thing as a suspension of rights in the interim.

   I am very well aware, and always was, of the article of the Constitution
   which says, as nearly as I can recollect the words, that "any citizen of
   the United States, who shall accept any title, place, or office, from any
   foreign king, prince, or state, shall forfeit and lose his right of
   citizenship of the United States."

   Had the article said, that any citizen of the United States, who shall be
   a member of any foreign convention, for the purpose of forming a free
   constitution, shall forfeit and lose the right of citizenship of the
   United States, the article had been directly applicable to me; but the
    idea of such an article never could have entered the mind of the American
   Convention, and the present article is altogether foreign to the case with
   respect to me. It supposes a government in active existence, and not a
   government dissolved; and it supposes a citizen of America accepting
   titles and offices under that government, and not a citizen of America who
   gives his assistance in a convention chosen by the people, for the purpose
   of forming a government de nouveau founded on their authority.

   The late Constitution and Government of France was dissolved the tenth of
   August, 1792. The National Legislative Assembly then in being, supposed
   itself without sufficient authority to continue its sittings, and it
   proposed to the departments to elect not another legislative assembly, but
   a convention for the express purpose of forming a new constitution. When
   the Assembly were discoursing on this matter, some of the members said,
   that they wished to gain all the assistance possible upon the subject of
   free constitutions; and expressed a wish to elect and invite foreigners of
   any nation to the Convention, who had distinguished themselves in
   defending, explaining and propagating the principles of liberty.

   It was on this occasion that my name was mentioned in the Assembly. (I was
   then in England.) After this, a deputation from a body of the French
   people, in order to remove any objection that might be made against my
   assisting at the proposed convention, requested the Assembly, as their
   representatives, to give me the title of French citizen; after which, I
   was elected a -member of the Convention, in four different departments, as
   is already known.

   The case, therefore, is, that I accepted nothing from any king, prince or
   state, nor from any government: for France was without any government,
   except what arose from common consent, and the necessity of the case.
   Neither did / ma\\e myself a servant of the French Republic, as the letter
   alluded to expresses; for at that time France was not a republic, not even
   in name. She was altogether a people in a state of revolution.

   It was not until the Convention met that France was declared a republic,
   and monarchy abolished; soon after which a committee was elected, of which
   I was a member, to form a constitution, which was presented to the
   Convention [and read by Condorcet, who was also a member] the fifteenth
   and sixteenth of February following, but was not to be taken into
   consideration till after the expiration of two months, and if approved of
   by the Convention, was then to be referred to the people for their
   acceptance, with such additions or amendments as the Convention should
   make.

   In thus employing myself upon the formation of a constitution, I certainly
   did nothing inconsistent with the American Constitution. I took no oath of
   allegiance to France, or any other oath whatever. I considered the
   citizenship they had presented me with as a honorary mark of respect paid
   to me not only as a friend to liberty, but as an American citizen. My
   acceptance of that, or of the deputyship, not conferred on me by any king,
   prince or state, but by a people in a state of revolution and contending
   for liberty, required no transfer of my allegiance or of my citizenship
   from America to France. There I was a real citizen, paying taxes; here, I
   was a voluntary friend, employing myself on a temporary service. Every
   American in Paris knew that it was my constant intention to return to
   America, as soon as a constitution should be established, and that I
   anxiously waited for that event.

   I know not what opinions have been circulated in America. It may have been
   supposed there that I had voluntarily and intentionally abandoned America,
   and that my citizenship had ceased by my own choice. I can easily
   [believe] there are those in that country who would take such a proceeding
   on my part somewhat in disgust. The idea of forsaking old friendships for
   new acquaintances is not agreeable. I am a little warranted in making this
   supposition by a letter I received some time ago from the wife of one of
   the Georgia delegates in which she says

   "Your friends on this side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of
   your abandoning America."

   I have never abandoned her in thought, word or deed; and I feel it
   incumbent upon me to give the assurance to the friends I have in that
   country and with whom I have always intended and am determined,  if the
   possibility exists, to close the scene of my life. It is there that I have
   made myself a home. It is there that I have given the services of my best
   days. America never saw me flinch from her cause in the most gloomy and
   perilous of her situations; and I know there are those in that country who
   will not flinch from me. If I have enemies (and every man has some) I
   leave them to the enjoyment of their ingratitude. (I subjoin in a note,
   for the sake of wasting the solitude of a prison, the answer that I gave
   to the part of the letter above mentioned. It is not inapplicable to the
   subject of this Memorial; but it contains somewhat of a melancholy idea, a
   little predictive, that I hope is not becoming true so soon.

   "You touch me on a very tender point when you say that my friends on your
   side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of my abandoning America.
   They are right. I had rather see my horse Button eating the grass of
   Borden-Town or Morrisania than see all the pomp and show of Europe.

   "A thousand years hence (for I must indulge a few thoughts) perhaps in
   less, America may be what Europe now is. The innocence of her character,
   that won the hearts of all nations in her favor, may sound like a romance
   and her inimitable virtues as if it had never been. The ruin of that
   liberty which thousands bled for or struggled to obtain may just furnish
   materials for a village tale or extort a sigh from rustic sensibility,
   while the fashionable of that day, enveloped in dissipation, shall deride
   the principle and deny the fact.

   "When we contemplate the fall of Empires and the extinction of the nations
   of the Ancient World, we see but little to excite our regret than the
   mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent museums, lofty pyramids
   and walls and towers of the most costly workmanship; but when the Empire
   of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow will be
   infinitely greater than crumbling brass and marble can inspire it. It will
   not then be said, here stood a temple of vast antiquity; here rose a babel
   of invisible height; or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance; but
   here, Ah, painful thought; the noblest work of human wisdom, the grandest
   scene of human glory, the fair cause of Freedom rose and fell. Read this,
   and then ask if I forget America."-Author.)

   It is somewhat extraordinary that the idea of my not being a citizen of
   America should have arisen only at the time that I am imprisoned in France
   because, or on the pretense that, I am a foreigner. The case involves a
   strange contradiction of ideas. None of the Americans who came to France
   while I was in liberty had conceived any such idea or circulated any such
   opinion; and why it should arise now is a matter yet to be explained.
   However discordant the late American Minister G. M. [Gouverneur Morris]
   and the late French Committee of Public Safety were, it suited the purpose
   of both that I should be continued in arrestation. The former wished to
   prevent my return to America, that I should not expose his misconduct; and
   the latter, lest I should publish to the world the history of its
   wickedness. While that Minister and the Committee continued I had no
   expectation of liberty. I speak here of the Committee of which Robespierre
   was member.

   I ever must deny, that the article of the American Constitution already
   mentioned, can be applied either verbally, intentionally, or
   constructively, to me. It undoubtedly was the intention of the Convention
   that framed it, to preserve the purity of the American Republic from being
   debased by foreign and foppish customs; but it never could be its
   intention to act against the principles of liberty, by forbidding its
   citizens to assist in promoting those principles in foreign countries;
   neither could it be its intention to act against the principles of
   gratitude.

   France had aided America in the establishment of her revolution, when
   invaded and oppressed by England and her auxiliaries. France in her turn
   was invaded and oppressed by a combination of foreign despots. In this
   situation, I conceived it an act of gratitude in me, as a citizen of
   America, to render her in return the best services I could perform.

   I came to France (for I was in England when I received the invitation) not
   to enjoy ease, emoluments and foppish honors, as the article supposes; but
   to encounter difficulties and dangers in defense of liberty; and I must
   question whether those who now malignantly seek (for some I believe do) to
   turn this to my injury, would have had courage to have done the same
   thing. I am sure Gouverneur Morris would not. He told me the second day
   after my arrival (in Paris), that the Austrians and Prussians, who were
   then at Verdun, would be in Paris-in a fort-night. "I have no idea," said
   he, "that seventy thousand disciplined troops can be stopped in their
   march by any power in France."

   Besides the reasons I have already given for accepting the invitations to
   the Convention, I had another that has reference particularly to America,
   and which I mentioned to Mr. Pinckney the night before I left London to
   come to Paris: "That it was to the interest of America that the system of
   European governments should be changed and placed on the same principle
   with her own." Mr. Pinckney agreed fully in the same opinion. I have done
   my part toward it.

   It is certain that governments upon similar systems agree better together
   than those that are founded on principles discordant with each other; and
   the same rule holds good with respect to the people living under them. In
   the latter case they offend each other by pity, or by reproach; and the
   discordancy carries itself to matters of commerce. I am not an ambitious
   man, but perhaps I have been an ambitious American. I have wished to see
   America the Mother Church of government and I have done my utmost to exalt
   her character and her condition.

   I have now stated sufficient matter to show that the article in question
   is not applicable to me; and that any such application to my injury, as
   well in circumstances as in right, is contrary both to the letter and
   intention of that article, and is illegal and unconstitutional. Neither do
   I believe that any jury in America, when they are informed of the whole of
   the case, would give a verdict to deprive me of my rights upon that
   article. The citizens of America, I believe, are not very fond of
   permitting forced and indirect explanations to be put upon matters of this
   kind.

   I know not what were the merits of the case with respect to the person who
   was prosecuted for acting as prize master to a French privateer, but I
   know that the jury gave a verdict against the prosecution. The rights I
   have acquired are dear to me. They have been acquired by honorable means,
   and by dangerous service in the worst of times, and I cannot passively
   permit them to be wrested from me. I conceive it my duty to defend them,
   as the case involves a constitutional and public question, which is, how
   far the power of the Federal Government extends, in depriving any citizen
   of his rights of citizenship, or of suspending them.

   That the explanation of national treaties belongs to Congress is strictly
   constitutional; but not the explanation of the Constitution itself, any
   more than the explanation of law in the case of individual citizens. These
   are altogether judiciary questions. It is, however, worth observing, that
   Congress, in explaining the article of the treaty with respect to French
   prizes and French privateers, confined itself strictly to the letter of
   the article. Let them explain the article of the Constitution with respect
   to me in the same manner, and the decision, did it appertain to them,
   could not deprive me of my rights of citizenship, or suspend them, for I
   have accepted nothing from any king, prince, state or government.

   You will please observe that I speak as if the Federal Government had made
   some declaration upon the subject of my citizenship; whereas the fact is
   otherwise; and your saying that you have no order respecting me is a proof
   of it. Those therefore who propagate the report of my not being considered
   as a citizen of America by Government, do it to the prolongation of my
   imprisonment, and without authority; for Congress, as a government, has
   neither decided upon it, nor yet taken the matter into consideration; and
   I request you to caution such persons against spreading such reports. But
   be these matters as they may, I cannot have a doubt that you will find and
   feel the case very different, since you have heard what I have to say, and
   known what my situation is [better] than you did before your arrival.

   But it was not the Americans only, but the Convention also, that knew what
   my intentions were upon that subject. In my last discourse delivered at
   the Tribune of the Convention, January 19, 1793, on the motion for
   suspending the execution of Louis XVI, I said (the Deputy Bancal read the
   translation in French):

   "It unfortunately happens that the person who is the subject of the
   present discussion, is considered by the Americans as having been the
   friend of their revolution. His execution will be an affliction to them,
   and it is in your power not to wound the feelings of your ally. Could I
   speak the French language I would descend to your bar, and in their name
   become your petitioner to respite the execution of the sentence.

   "As the Convention was elected for the express purpose of forming a
   Constitution, its continuance cannot be longer than four or five months
   more at furthest; and, if after my return to America, I should employ
   myself in writing the history of the French Revolution, I had rather
   record a thousand errors on the side of mercy than be obliged to tell one
   act of severe justice.

   "Ah citizens! give not the tyrant of England the triumph of seeing the man
   perish on a scaffold who had aided my much-loved America."

   Does this look as if I had abandoned America? But if she abandons me in
   the situation I am in, to gratify the enemies of humanity, let that
   disgrace be to herself. But I know the people of America better than to
   believe it, though I undertake not to answer for every individual.

   When this discourse was pronounced, Marat launched himself into the middle
   of the hall and said that "I voted against the punishment of death because
   I was a Quaker." I replied that "I voted against it both morally and
   politically."

   I certainly went a great way, considering the rage of the times, in
   endeavoring to prevent that execution. I had many reasons for so doing. I
   judged, and events have shown that I judged rightly, that if they once
   began shedding blood, there was no knowing where it would end; and as to
   what the world might call honor, the execution would appear like a nation
   killing a mouse; and in a political view, would serve to transfer the
   hereditary claim to some more formidable enemy. The man could do no more
   mischief; and that which he had done was not only from the vice of his
   education, but was as much the fault of the nation in restoring him after
   he had absconded June 21, 1791, as it was his.

   I made the proposal for imprisonment until the end of the war and
   perpetual banishment after the war, instead of the punishment of death.
   Upwards of three hundred members voted for that proposal. The sentence for
   absolute death (for some members had voted the punishment of death
   conditionally) was carried by a majority of twenty-five out of more than
   seven hundred.

   I return from this digression to the proper subject of my memorial.

   Painful as the want of liberty may be, it is a consolation to me to
   believe that my imprisonment proves to the world that I had no share in
   the murderous system that then reigned. That I was an enemy to it, both
   morally and politically, is known to all who had any knowledge of me; and
   could I have written French as well as I can English, I would publicly
   have exposed its wickedness and shown the ruin with which it was pregnant.
   They who have esteemed me on former occasions, whether in America or in
   Europe, will, I know, feel no cause to abate that esteem, when they
   reflect the imprisonment with preservation of character is preferable to
   liberty with disgrace.

   I here close my memorial and proceed to offer you a proposal that appears
   to me suited to all the circumstances of the case; which is that you
   reclaim me conditionally, until the opinion of Congress can be obtained on
   the subject of my citizenship of America; and that I remain in liberty
   under your protection during that time.

   I found this proposal upon the following grounds:

   First, you say you have no orders respecting me; consequently, you have no
   orders not to reclaim me; and in this case you are left discretionary
   judge whether to reclaim or not. My proposal therefore unites a
   consideration of your situation with my own.

   Secondly, I am put in arrestation because I am a foreigner. It is
   therefore necessary to determine to what country I belong. The right of
   determining this question cannot appertain exclusively to the Committee of
   Public Safety or General Surety; because I appeal to the Minister of the
   United States, and show that my citizenship of that country is good and
   valid, referring at the same time, through the agency of the Minister, my
   claim of right to the opinion of Congress. It being a matter between two
   governments.

   Thirdly, France does not claim me for a citizen; neither do I set up any
   claim of citizenship in France. The question is simply whether I am or am
   not a citizen of America. I am imprisoned here on the decree for
   imprisoning foreigners because, say they, I was born in England.

   I say in answer that, though born in England, I am not a subject of the
   English Government any more than any other American who was born, as they
   all were, under the same government, or than the citizens of France are
   subjects of the French monarchy under which they were born. I have twice
   taken the oath of abjuration to the British King and Government and of
   allegiance to America-once as a citizen of the State of Pennsylvania in
   1776, and again before Congress, administered to me by the President, Mr.
   Hancock, when I was appointed Secretary in the office of Foreign Affairs
   in 1777.

   The letter before quoted in the first page of this memorial, says, "It
   would be out of character for an American Minister to interfere in the
   internal affairs of France." This goes on the idea that I am a citizen of
   France, and a member of the Convention, which is not the fact.
   TheConvention have declared me to be a foreigner; and consequently the
   citizenship and the election are null and void. It also has the appearance
   of a decision, that the article of the Constitution, respecting grants
   made to American citizens by foreign kings, princes or states, is
   applicable to me; which is the very point in question, and against the
   application of which I contend.

   I state evidence to the Minister, to show that I am not within the letter
   or meaning of that article; that it cannot operate against me; and I apply
   to him for the protection that I conceive I have a right to ask and to
   receive. The internal affairs of France are out of the question with
   respect to my application or his interference. I ask it not as a citizen
   of France, for I am not one:

   I ask it not as a member of the Convention, for I am not one; both these,
   as before said, have been rendered null and void; I ask it not as a man
   against whom there is any accusation, for there is none; I ask it not as
   an exile from America, whose liberties I have honorably and generously
   contributed to establish; I ask it as a citizen of America, deprived of
   his liberty in France, under the plea of being a foreigner; and I ask it
   because I conceive I am entitled to it upon every principle of
   constitutional justice and national honor.

   But though I thus positively assert my claim because I believe I have a
   right to do so, it is perhaps most eligible, in the present situation of
   things, to put that claim upon the footing I have already mentioned; that
   is, that the Minister reclaims me conditionally until the opinion of
   Congress can be obtained on the subject of my citizenship of America, and
   that I remain in liberty under the protection of the Minister during that
   interval.

   (Signed) THOMAS PAINE.

   N.B. I should have added that as Gouverneur Morris could not inform
   Congress of the cause of my arrestation, as he knew it not himself, it is
   to be supposed that Congress was not enough acquainted with the case to
   give any directions respecting me when you came away.

   T.P.
