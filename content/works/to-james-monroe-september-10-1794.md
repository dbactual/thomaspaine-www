   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.
   
   The following Memorial contains remarks upon my Claim of Citizenship in America, 
   with a proposal misled, as I conceive, to the state of things -
   
   Memorial of Thomas Paine to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the Unites States 
   of America.

   Prison of the Luxembourg Sepr. 14th 1794 &mdash; 

   I adresss this Memorial to you in Consequence of a letter I received from
   a friend 18th Fructidor (Sepr. 4) in which he says, "Mr. Monroe
   has told me, that he has no orders (meaning from the American Congress)
   respecting you &mdash; but I am sure he will leave nothing undone to liberate
   you &mdash; but from what I can learn from all the late Americans you are not
   considered either by the Government or by the individuals as an American
   Citizen &mdash; you have been made a french Citizen, which you have accepted, 
   and you have further made yourself a servant of the french Republic, and
   therefore it would be out of Character for an American Minister to
   interfere in their internal concerns &mdash; you must therefore either be
   liberated out of compliment to America, or stand your trial, which you
   have a right to demand." &mdash; 

   This information was so unexpected by me, that I am at a loss how to
   answer it. I know not on what principle it originates; whether from an
   Idea that I had voluntarily abandoned my Citizenship of America for that
   of France, or from any article of the American Constitution applied to me.
   The first is untrue with respect to any intention on my part; and the
   second is without foundation as I shall shew in the course of this
   memorial.

   The Idea of conferring honour of Citizenship upon foreigners, who had
   distinguished themselves in propagating the principles of liberty and
   humanity, in opposition to despotism war and bloodshed, was first
   proposed by me to la Fayette at the commencement of the french Revolution
   when his heart appeared to be warmed with those principles. My motive in
   making this proposal was to render the people of different nations more
   fraternal than they had been or then were. &mdash; I observed that almost every
   branch of Science had possessed itself of the exercise of this right so
   far as it regarded its own institution. Most of the academies and societies in 
   Europe, and also those of America 
   conferred the rank of honorary member upon foreigners eminent in
   knowledge, and made them, in fact, citizens of their literary or
   Scientific republic, without affecting or anyways diminishing their rights
   of Citizenship in their own Country, or in other societies; and why the
   Science of Government should not have the same advantages; or why the
   people of one nation should not by their representatives exercise the
   right of conferring the honour of Citizenship upon individuals eminent in
   another Nation without affecting *their* rights of Citizenship in their proper 
   Country is a problem yet to be solved.

   I now proceed to remark on that part of the letter in which the writer
   says, "that *from what he can learn from all the late Americans I am not
   considered in America, either by the Government or by the individuals, as
   an American citizen.*"

   In the first place, I wish to ask, what is here meant by the Government of
   America? The Members who compose the Government are only individuals when
   in Conversation, and who, most probably hold very different opinions upon
   the subject. &mdash; Have Congress as a body made any declaration 
   that they no longer consider me as a Citizen? If they have not,
   any thing they may say is no more than the opinion of individuals,
   and consequently is not legal authority, nor anyways sufficient authority,
   to deprive any man of his Citizenship. Besides whether a man has
   forfeited his Rights of Citizenship is a question not determinable by
   Congress, but by a Court of Judicature and a Jury, and must depend upon
   evidence, and the application of some Law or Article of the Constitution
   to the Case. No such proceeding has yet been had, and consequently I
   remain a Citizen until it be had, be that decision what it may; for there
   can be no such thing as a Suspension of Rights in the interim.

   I am very well aware, and always was, of the Article of the Constitution
   which says, as nearly as I can recollect the words, that *any citizen of
   the United States, who accepts any title, place, or office, from any
   foreign king prince or state shall forfeit and lose his right of
   citizenship of the United States.*"

   Had the article said, *that any Citizen of the United States who shall be
   member of any foreign convention for the purpose of forming a free
   Constitution shall forfeit and lose the right of Citizen of the
   United States*, the Article had been directly applicable to me; but the
   Idea of such an Article never could have entered the mind of the American
   Convention, and the present Article is altogether foreign to the case with
   respect to me. &mdash; It supposes a Government in active existence; and not a
   Government dissolved; and it supposes a Citizen of America accepting
   titles and offices under that Government, and not a Citizen of America who
   gives his assistance in a Convention chosen by the people for the purpose
   of forming a government de nouveau founded on their authority. &mdash;

   The late Constitution and Government of France was dissolved the 10th of
   August 1792. The National legislative Assembly then in being supposed
   itself without sufficient authority to continue its sittings, and it
   proposed to the departments to elect, not another legislative assembly, but
   a Convention for the express purpose of forming a New Constitution. When
   the Assembly were discoursing on this matter some of the members said
   that they wished to gain all the assistance possible upon the subject of
   free Constitutions, and expressed a wish to elect and invite foreigners of
   any nation to the Convention who had distinguished themselves in
   defending, explaining and propagating the principles of liberty. It was on 
   this occasion that my name was mentioned in the Assembly. After this, a 
   deputation from a body of the people, in order to remove any objection that 
   might be made against my
   assisting at the proposed Convention, requested the Assembly as their
   representatives to give me the title of french citizen, after which I
   was elected a Member of the Convention (in four different departments) as
   is already known.

   The case, therefore, is, that I accepted nothing from any King, Prince or
   State, nor from any Government, for France was without any government
   except what arose from common consent, and the necessity of the Case.
   Neither "*did I make myself a servant of the French Republic*" as the letter
   alluded to expresses, for at that time France was not a Republic not even
   in name. She was altogether a people in a state of Revolution.
   It was not until the Convention met that France was declared a Republic,
   and Monarchy abolished; soon after which a Committee was elected, of which
   I was a Member, to form a Constitution, which was presented to the
   Convention the 15th & 16th of Febry following, but was not to be taken into
   Consideration till after the expiration of two months, and if approved of
   by the Convention was then to be referred to the people for their
   acceptance, with such additions or amendments as the Convention should
   make.

   In thus employing myself upon the formation of a constitution, I certainly
   did nothing inconsistent with the American Constitution. I took no oath of
   allegiance to France nor any other oath whatever. I considered the
   Citizenship they had presented me with as a honorary mark of respect paid
   to me not only as a friend to Liberty but as an American Citizen. My
   acceptance of that, or of the deputyship, not confered on me by any King,
   Prince or State, but by a people in a State of revolution and contending
   for liberty, required no transfer of my allegiance or of my Citizenship
   from America to France. There I was a real Citizen paying taxes, here I
   was a voluntary friend, employing myself on a temporary service. Every
   American in Paris knew that it was my constant intention to return to
   America as soon as a Constitution should be established and that I
   anxiously waited for that event.
   
   But it was not the mericans only but the Convention also that knew what my 
   intentions were upon that subject. In my last discourse delivered at the Tribune 
   of the Convention Janry. 19, 1793 on the Motion for suspending the execution 
   of Louis 16th I said (the deputy Bancal read the translation in French) &mdash; 
   *It unfortunately happens that the person who is the subject of the present 
   discussion is considered by the Americans as having been the friend of their 
   revolution. His execution will be an affliction for them, and it is in your 
   power not to wound the feelings of your ally. Could I speak the french language 
   I would descend to your Bar and in their name become your petitioner to restrict 
   the Execution of the sentence.*" &mdash; "*As the Convention was elected for the 
   express purpose of forming a Constitution its continuance cannot be longer than 
   four or five months more at furtherest; and if, after my return to America, I 
   should employ myself in writing the history of the french revolution, I had 
   rather record a thousand Errors on the side of Mercy than be obliged to tell one 
   Act od severe Justice*" &mdash; "*Ah Citizens! give not the Tyrant of England 
   the triumph of seeing the man perish on a Scaffold who had aided my much beloved 
   America.*" &mdash; Does this look as if I had abandoned America? But if she 
   abandoned me, in the situation I am in, to gratify the enemies of humanity, let 
   that disgrace be to herself. But I know the people of America better than to 
   believe it, tho' I undertake not to answer for every individual. 
   
   When this discourse was pronounced Marat launched himself into the middle of the 
   Hall, and said that "*I voted agaist the punishment of death because I was a 
   Quaker.*" I replied, " that *I voted against it both morally and politically.*" 
   I certainly went a great way, considering the rage of the times, in 
   endeavouring to prevent that execution. I had many reasons for so doing. I 
   judged, and events have shewn that I judged rightly, that if once they began 
   shedding blood there was no knowing where it would end; and as to what the 
   world might call, *honour*, the execution would appear like a Nation killing a 
   mouse; and in a political view would serve to transfer the hereditary claim to 
   some more formidable Enemy. The man could do no more mischief, and that which 
   he had done was not only from the view of his education, but it was as much the 
   fault of the Nation in restoring him after he had absconded June 21st, 1791 as 
   it was his. I made the proposal for imprisonment until the end of the war and 
   perpetual banishment after the war instead of the punishment of death. Upwards 
   of three hundred deputies voted for this proposal. The sentence for absolute 
   death, (for some members had voted the punishment of death conditionally) was 
   carried by a majority of twenty five votes out of more than seven hundred.
   
   I return from this description to the proper subject of my Memorial, I ever must 
   deny that the Article of the American Constitution already mentioned can be 
   applied either verbally, intentionally, or constructively to me. It 
   undoubtedly was the intention of the Convention that framed it to preserve the 
   purity of the American Republic from being debased by foreign and foppish 
   customs; but it never could be its intention to act against the principles of 
   liberty by forbidding its Citizens to assist in promoting those principles in 
   foreign Countries. Neither could it be its intention to act against the 
   principles of gratitude. France had aided America in the establishment of her 
   revolution when invaded and oppressed by England and her Auxilaries; France in 
   her turn was invaded and oppressed by a combination of foreign despots. In this 
   situation I conceived it an act of gratitude in one as a Citizen of America, to 
   render her in return the best services I could perform. I came to France (for I 
   was in England when I received the invitation) not to enjoy ease, emoluments, 
   and foppish honours as the Article supposes, but to encounter difficulties and 
   dangers in defence of liberty: And I much question whether those who now 
   malignantly seek (for some I believe do) to turn this to my injury would have 
   had the courage to have done the same thing. I am sure Governeur Morris would 
   not, for he told me the second day after my arrival, that the Austrians and 
   Prussians, who were then at Verdun, would be in Paris in a fortnight. "*I have 
   no Idea,* said he, *that seventy thousand disciplined Troops can be stopt in 
   their march by any power in France.*
   
   Besides the reasons I have already given for accepting the invitation to the 
   Convention, I had another that has reference only to America, and which I 
   mentioned to Mr. Pinckney the night before I left London to come to Paris. 
   &mdash; "*that it was to the interest of America to change the system of 
   European Governments and place them on the same principles with herself.*" 
   Mr. Pinckney agreed fully in the same opinion - I have done my part towards it. 
   
   It is certain that Governments upon similar systems execute better together than 
   those that are discordant, and the same rule holds good with respect to the 
   people living under them. In the latter case they afford each other by Pity, or 
   by reproach, and the discerning carries itself even to matters of Commerce. I am 
   not an ambitious man, but perhaps I have been an ambitious American. I have 
   wished to see America the *Mother Church* of Governments; and I have done my 
   utmost to exalt her character and her condition
   
   I have now stated sufficient matter to shew that the Article in question cannot 
   be applied to me, and that any such application to my injury, as well in 
   Circumstances so in Rights, as contrary both to the letter and intention that 
   Article, and is illegal and unconstitutional. Neither do I believe that any Jury 
   in America, when they are informed of the whole of the Case, would give a 
   Verdict to deprive me of my Rights upon that article. The Citizens of America, 
   I believe, are not very fond of permitting forced and indiscreet explanations 
   to be put upon matters of this kind. I know not what were the merits of the Case 
   with respect to the person who was prosecuted for acting as King's Master to a 
   french Privateer, but I know that the Jury gave a Verdict against the 
   prosecution. The Rights I have acquired are dear to me. They have been acquired 
   by honorable means, and by dangerous service, in the worst of times, and I 
   cannot possibly permit them to be passively wrested from me. I conceive it my 
   duty to defend them as the Case involves a constitutional and public question, 
   which is, how far the power of the federal Goverenment intends in depriving any 
   Citizen of his Rights of Citizenship, or if suspending them.
   
   That the explanation of National Treaties belong to Congress is admitted, 
   strictly constitutional, but not the explanation of the Constitution itself, 
   any more than the explanation of Law, when in the cases of individual Citizens. 
   These are altogether ordinary Questions. It is however worth observing that 
   Congress in explaining the Article of the Treaty with respect to french Prizes 
   and french Privateers confined itself strictly to the letter of the Article. Let 
   them explain the Article of the Constitution with respect to me in the same 
   manner, and this decision, did it appertain to them, could not deprive me of my 
   Rights of Citizenship nor suspend them, for I have accepted nothing from any 
   king, prince, state, or government.
   
   You will please to observe that I speak as if the federal Government has made 
   some declaration upon the subject of my Citizenship, whereas the fact is 
   otherwise, and your saying that you have no orders respecting me is a proof of 
   it. Those therefore who propagate the report of my not being considered as a 
   Citizen by the *Government* do it to the prolongation of my imprisonment and 
   without authority; for Congress *as a Government* has neither decided upon it, 
   nor taken the matter into consideration, and I request you to caution such 
   persons against spreading such opinions. &mdash; But be these matters as they 
   may I cannot have a doubt but you find and feel the case very different since 
   you have heard what I have to say and known what my situation is, than you did 
   before your arrival.   

   I know not what opinions have been circulated in America. It may have been
   supposed there that I had intentionally and voluntarily abandoned America
   and that my Citizenship had ceased by my own choice. I can easily
   conceive there are those in that Country who would take such a proceeding
   on my part somewhat in disgust. The idea of forsaking old friendships for
   new acquaintances is not agreeable. I am a little warranted in making this
   supposition by a letter I received some time ago from the wife of one of
   the Georgia delegates, in which she says "*your friends on this side the water 
   cannot be reconciled to the idea of your abandoning America.*"

   I have never abandoned her in *Thought, Word, or Deed*, and I feel it
   incumbent upon me to give the assurance to the friends I have in that
   Country and with whom I have always intended, and am determined,  if the
   possibility exists, to close the scene of my Life. &mdash; It is there that I 
   have made myself a home &mdash; It is there that I have given the services of my 
   best days. America never saw me flinch from her Cause in the most gloomy and
   perilous of her situations; and I know there are those in that Country who
   will not flinch from me. If I have enemies (and every man has some) I
   leave them to the enjoyment of their ingratitude. 
   
   (I subjoin in this note,
   for the sake of wasting the solitude of a prison, the answer that I gave
   to the part of the letter above mentioned. It is not inapplicable to the
   subject of this Memorial; but it contains somewhat of a melancholy Idea a
   little predictive, that I hope is not becoming true so soon.

   "You touch me on a very tender point when you say that my friends on your
   side the water cannot be reconciled to the Idea of my abandoning America.
   They are Right. I had rather see my horse Button eating the grass of
   Borden-Town or Morrisania than see all the pomp and show of Europe. &mdash; 
   A thousand years hence (for I must indulge a few thoughts) perhaps in
   less, America may be what Europe now is. The innocence of her character,
   that won the hearts of all Nations in her favour may sound like a romance,
   and her inimitable virtues as if it had never been. The ruin of that
   liberty which thousands bled for, or struggled to obtain may just furnish
   materials for a village tale or extort a sigh from rustic sensibility,
   while the fashionable of that day, enveloped in dissipation, shall deride
   the principle and deny the fact.

   "When we contemplate the fall of Empires and the extinction of the Nations
   of the Ancient World, we see but little to excite our regret, than the
   mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty pyramids
   and Walls and Towers of the most costly workmanship; but when the empire
   of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow will be
   infinitely greater than crumbling brass and marble can inspire. It will
   not then be said, here stood a temple of vast antiquity; here rose a babel
   of invisible height; or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance &mdash; But
   here, Ah, painful thought! the noblest work of human Wisdom, the grandest
   scene of human glory, the fair cause of Freedom rose and fell. &mdash; Read 
   this and then ask if I forget America.")

   It is somewhat extraordinary that the Idea of my not being a Citizen of
   America should have arisen only at the time that I am imprisoned in France
   because, or on the pretense that, I am a foreigner. The Case involves a
   strange contradiction of Ideas. None of the Americans who came to France
   while I was in liberty had conceived any such Idea or circulated any such
   opinion, and why it should arise now is a matter yet to be explained.
   However discordant the late American Minister Gouverneur Morris 
   and the late french Committee of public safety were, it suited the purpose
   of both that I should be continued in arrestation. The former wished to
   prevent my return to America that I should not expose his misconduct, and
   the latter, lest I should publish to the world the history of its
   wickedness. Whilst that Minister and the Committee continued I had no
   expectation of liberty. - I speak here of the Committee of which Robespierre
   was Member.
   
   Painful as the want of Liberty may be, it is a consolation to me to believe, 
   that my imprisonment proves to the world that I have no share in the murderous 
   system that then reigned. That I was an Enemy to it both morally and 
   politically, is known by all who had any knowlwdge of me, and could I have 
   written french as well as I can english I would publicly had exposed it 
   wickedness and shewn the ruin with which it was poignant. Those who have 
   esteemed me on former occasions, whether in America or in Europe, will, I know, 
   feel no cause to abate that esteem when they reflect, that *imprisonment with 
   preservation of Character is preferable to Liberty with disgrace.*
   
   I here close my Memorial, and proceed to offer to you a proposal, that appears 
   to me suited to all the Circumstances of the Case, which is, that you reclaim me 
   conditionally until the opinion of Congress can be obtained upon the subject of 
   my Citizenship of America; and that I remain in Liberty under your protection 
   during that time. &mdash; 
   
   I found this proposal upon the following grounds.
   
   First &mdash; You say, you have no orders respecting me, consequently you have 
   no orders *not* to reclaim me, and in this case you are left discretionary judge 
   whether to reclaim or not. My proposal therefore would a Consideration of your 
   situation with my own.
   
   Secondly. I am put Arrestation because I am a foreigner. It is therefore 
   necessary to determine to what Country I belong. The Right of determining this 
   question cannot appertain exclusively to the Committee of Public Safety or of 
   general surety; because I appeal to the Minister of the United States and shew 
   that my Citizenship of that Country is good and valid; refering at the same 
   time, through the Agency of the Minister, my clai of Right is the opinion of 
   Congress. It being a matter between two Governments.
   
   Thirdly. France does not claim me for a Citizen; neither do I set up any claim 
   of Citizenship in France. The question simply is whether I am, or am not, a 
   Citizen of America. I am imprisoned here on the decree for imprisoning 
   foreigners; because, say they, I was born in England. I say, in answer, that 
   though born in England, I am not a subject of the english Government any more 
   than any other American is who was born, as they all were under the same 
   government; or than the Citizens of France are subjects of the french Monarchy 
   under which they were born. I have twice taken the oath of abjuration to the 
   british king and Government and of allegiance to America: Once as a Citizen of 
   the state of Pennsylvania in the year 1776, and again before Congress 
   administered to me by the President Mr. Hancock when I was appointed secretary 
   in the Office of foreign Affairs in 1777.
   
   The letter before quoted in the first page of this Memorial says that "*it would 
   be out of Character for an American Minister to interfere in the internal 
   affairs of France.*" This declaration goes on the Idea that I am a Citizen of 
   France and a member of the Convention which is not that fact. The Convention 
   have declared me to be a foreigner, and consequantly the Citizenship and the 
   election are nul and void. It also has the appearance of a *decision* that the 
   Article of the Constitution respecting grants made to American Citizens by 
   foreign kings princesor States is applicable to me, which is the very point in 
   question and against the application of which I contend. I state evidence to the 
   Minister to shew that I am strictly within the letter and meaning of that
   Article; that it cannot operate against me; and I apply to him for the 
   protection that, I conceive, I have a right to ask and to receive. The internal 
   affairs of France are out of the question with respect to my application or his 
   interference. I ask it not as a Ciitizen of France for I am not one; I ask it 
   not as a member of the Convention for I am not one; both these as before said, 
   have been rendered nul and void. I ask it not as a man against whom there is any 
   accusation, for there is none; I ask it not as an exile from America where 
   independance I have honorably and generously contributed to establish; I ask it 
   as a Citizen of America deprived of his liberty in France under the plea of his 
   being a foreigner, and I ask it because I conceive I am entitled to it upon 
   every principle of Constitutional Justice and National honour.

   But though I thus positively assert my claim because I believe I have a
   right to do so, it is perhaps most eligible, in the present situation of
   things, to put that claim upon the footing I have already mentioned; that
   is, that the Minister reclaims me conditionally until the opinion of
   Congress can be obtained on the subject of my citizenship of America, and
   that I remain in liberty under the protection of the Minister during that
   interval.

   N.B. I should have added that as Govr Morris could not inform
   Congress of the Cause of my Arrestation, as he knew it not himself, it may
   be supposed that Congress were not enough acquainted with the Case to
   give any directions respecting me when you came away.
