   The writing is not in the style that Paine ever used elsewhere, using references to the “happy wilderness”,
   “the two terrestrial Charons, who ferried me over the Schuykill”, is not Paine; and especially the reference
   to “the servants of great men always imitate their masters” is definitely not Paine.

   New Anecdaotes of Alexander the Great

   ON one of those calm and gloomy days, which have a strange effect in
   disposing the mind to pensiveness, I quitted the busy town and withdrew
   into the country. As I passed towards the Schuylkill, my ideas enlarged
   with the prospect, and sprung from place to place with an agility for
   which nature had not a simile. Even the eye is a loiterer, when compared
   with the rapidity of the thoughts. Before I could reach the ferry, I had
   made the tour of the creation, and paid a regular visit to almost every
   country under the sun; and while I was crossing the river, I passed the
   Styx, and made large excursions into the shadowy regions; but my ideas
   relanded with my person, and taking a new flight inspected the state of
   things unborn. This happy wildness of imagination makes a man a lord of
   the world, and discovers to him the value and the vanity of all it
   possesses.

   Having discharged the two terrestrial Charons, who ferried me over the
   Schuylkill, I took up my staff and walked into the woods. Every thing
   conspired to hush me into a pleasing kind of melancholy-the trees seemed
   to sleep-and the air hung round me with such unbreathing silence, as if
   listening to my very thoughts. Perfectly at rest from care or business, I
   suffered my ideas to pursue their own unfettered fancies; and in less time
   than what is required to express it in, they had again passed the Styx and
   toured many miles into the new country.

   As the servants of great men always imitate their masters abroad, so my
   ideas, habiting themselves in my likeness, figured away with all the
   consequence of the person they belonged to; and calling themselves when
   united, I and Me, wherever they went, brought me on their return the
   following anecdotes of Alexander, viz.

   Having a mind to see in what manner Alexander lived in the Plutonian
   world, I crossed the Styx (without the help of Charon, for the dead only
   are his fare), and inquired of a melancholy looking shade, who was sitting
   on the banks of the river, if he could give me any account of him, Yonder
   he comes, replied the shade, get out of the way or you II be run over.
   Turning myself round I saw a grand equipage rolling towards me, which
   filled the whole avenue. Bless me! thought I, the gods still continue this
   man in his insolence and pomp! The chariot was drawn by eight horses in
   golden harness, and the whole represented his triumphal return, after he
   had conquered the world. It passed me with a splendor I had never seen
   before, and shined so luminously up into the country, that I discovered
   innumerable shades sitting under the trees, which before were invisible.
   As there were two persons in the chariot equally splendid, I could not
   distinguish which was Alexander, and on requiring that information of the
   shade, who still stood by, he replied, Alexander is not there. Did you
   not, continued I, tell me that Alexander was coming, and bid me get out of
   the way? Yes, answered the shade, because he was the forehorse on the side
   next to us. Horse! I mean Alexander the Emperor. I mean the same, replied
   the shade, for whatever he was on the other side of the water is nothing
   now, he is a HORSE here; and not always that, for when he is apprehensive
   that a good licking is intended for him, he watches his opportunity to
   roll out of the stable in the shape of a piece of dung, or in any other
   disguise he can escape by. On this information I turned instantly away,
   not being able to bear the thought of such astonishing degradation,
   notwithstanding the aversion I have to his character. But curiosity got
   the better of my compassion, and having a mind to see what sort of a
   figure the conquerer of the world cut in the stable, I directed my flight
   thither; he was just returned with the rest of the horses from the
   journey, and the groom was rubbing him down with a large furz bush, but
   turning himself round to get a still larger and more prickly one that was
   newly brought in, Alexander watched the opportunity, and instantly
   disappeared, on which I quitted the place, lest I should be suspected of
   stealing him; when I had reached the bands of the river, and was preparing
   to take my flight over, I perceived that I had picked up a bug among the
   Plutonian gentry, and thinking it was needless to increase the breed on
   this side the water,  was going to dispatch it, when the little wretch
   screamed out, Spare Alexander the GREAT. On which I withdrew the violence
   I was offering to his person, and holding up the emperor between my finger
   and thumb, he exhibited a most contemptible figure of the downfall of
   tyrant greatness. Affected with a mixture of concern and compassion (which
   he was always a stranger to) I suffered him to nibble on a pimple that was
   newly risen on my hand, in order to refresh him; after which I placed him
   on a tree to hide him, but a Tom Tit coming by, chopped him up with as
   little ceremony as he put whole kingdoms to the sword. On which I took my
   flight, reflecting with pleasure that I was not ALEXANDER THE GREAT.

   Esop.
