   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   London July 21st - 1791

   Dear Sir

   I received your favour of last Augt - by Col. Humphries since which
   I have not written to or heard from you. I mention this that you may know
   no letters have miscarried. I took the liberty of addressing my late work
   "Rights of Man," to you; but tho' I left it, at that time, to find its way
   to you, I now request your acceptance of fifty copies as a token of
   remembrance to yourself and my Friends. - The work has had a run beyond
   anything that has been published in this Country on the subject of
   Government, and the demand continues. In Ireland it has had a much
   greater. A letter I recd from Dublin 10th of May mentioned that the
   fourth edition was then on sale, I know not what number of copies were
   printed at each edition except the second, which was ten thousand. The
   same fate follows me here as I at first experienced in America, strong
   friends and violent enemies, but as I have got the ear of the Country, I
   shall go on, and at least shew them, what is a novelty here, that there
   can be a person beyond the reach of Corruption.

   I arrived here from france about ten days ago. M. de la Fayette is well.
   The affairs of that Country are verging to a new Crisis, whether the
   Government shall be monarchical and hereditary or wholly representative? I
   think the latter opinion will very generally prevail in the end. On this
   question the people are much forwarder than the National Assembly.

   After the establishment of the American Revolution, it did not appear to
   me that any object could arise great enough to engage me a second time. I
   began to feel myself happy in being quiet; but I now experience that
   principle is not confined to time or place, and that the ardour of
   Seventy six is capable of renewing itself. I have another work on hand
   which I intend shall be my last, for I long much to return to America. 
   
   It is not natural that fame should wish for a rival, but the case is
   otherwise with me, for I do most sincerely wish there was some person in
   this Country that could usefully and successfully attract the public
   attention, and leave me with a satisfied mind to the enjoyment of quiet
   life: but it is painful to see errors and abuses and sit down a senseless
   spectator. Of this your own mind will interpret mine.

   I have printed sixteen thousand copies; when the whole are gone of which
   there remain between three and four thousand I shall then make a cheap
   edition, just sufficient to bring in the price of the printing and paper,
   as I did by Common Sense.

   Mr. Green who will present you this, has been very much my friend. I
   wanted last October to draw for fifty pounds on General Lewis Morris who
   has some money of mine, but as he is unknown in the commercial line, and
   American credit not very good, and my own expended, I could not succeed,
   especially as Gov'r Morris was then in Holland. Col. Humphries went with
   me to your agent Mr. Walsh, to whom I stated the case, and took the
   liberty of saying that I knew you would not think it a trouble to receive
   it of Gen. Morris on Mr. Walsh's account, but he declined it. Mr. Green
   afterwards supplied me and I have since repaid him. He has a troublesome
   affair on his hands here, and is in danger of losing thirty or forty
   thousand pounds, embarked under the flag of the United State's is East
   India property. The persons who have received it withhold it, and shelter
   themselves under some law contrivance. He wishes to state the case to
   Congress, not only on his own account, but as a matter that may be
   nationally interesting.

   The public papers, will inform you of the riots and tumults at Birmingham,
   and of some disturbances at Paris, and as Mr. Green can retail them to you
   more particularly than I can do in a letter I leave those matters to his
   information.

   I am Sir, with affectionate concern for your happiness and Mrs. Washington
   Your much Obliged Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE
