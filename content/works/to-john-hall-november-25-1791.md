   To John Hall  November 25, 1791

   LONDON,

   MY OLD FRIEND:

   I am very happy to see a letter from you, and to hear that our Friends on
   the other side of the water are well. The Bridge has been put up, but
   being on wood butments they yielded, and it is now taken down. The first
   rib as an experiment was erected between two steel furnaces, which
   supported it firmly; it contained not quite three tons of iron, was ninety
   feet span, height of the arch five feet; it was loaded with six tons of
   iron, which remained upon it a twelve month.

   At present I am engaged on my political Bridge. I shall bring out a new
   work (Second part of the Rights of Man) soon after New Year. It will
   produce something one way or other. I see the tide is yet the wrong way,
   but there is a change of sentiment beginning. I have so far got the ear of
   John Bull that he will read what I write-which is more than ever was done
   before to the same extent. Rights of Man has had the greatest run of
   anything ever published in this country, at least of late years-almost
   sixteen thousand has gone off-and in Ireland above forty thousand-besides
   the above numbers one thousand printed cheap are now gone to Scotland by
   desire of some of the [friends] there. I have been applied to from
   Birmingham for leave to print ten thousand copies, but I intend, after the
   next work has had its run among those who will have handsome printed books
   and fine paper, to print an hundred thousand copies of each work and
   distribute them at sixpence a-piece; but this I do not at present talk of,
   because it will alarm the wise mad folks at St. James. I have received a
   letter from Mr. Jefferson who mentioned the great run it has had there. It
   has been attacked by John Adams, who has brought an host about his ears
   from all parts of the Continent. Mr. Jefferson has sent me twenty five
   different answers to Adams who wrote under the signature of Publicola. A
   letter is somewhere in the city for me from Mr. Laurens of S Carolina. I
   hope to receive it in a few days. I shall be glad at all times to see, or
   hear from you. Write to me (under cover) to Gordon, Booksellers N, 166
   Fleet Street, before you leave Leicester. How far is it from thence to
   Rotherham?

   Yours sincerely,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P.S. I have done you the compliment of answering your favor the inst. I
   received it which is more than I have done by any other-were I to answer
   all the letters I receive-I should require half a dozen clerks.
