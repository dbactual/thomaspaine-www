   Although he was the clerk of the Assembly at that time, he arrived on the day it was enacted. Conway included it
   in his Writings of Thomas Paine, Vol II, but says the act language starting in part III was written by George Bryan,
   and Conway included it because he claims Paine wrote a similar essay "African Slavery in America". But Paine didn't
   write that. The writing is similar to Anthony Benezet, and he would be the man in Philadelphia at that time to consult
   about such an act, as he was the leading anti-slavery author of the time.

   Emancipation of Slaves Act Preamble

   WHEN we contemplate our abhorrence of that condition, to which the arms
   and tyranny of Great Britain were exerted to reduce us, when we look back
   on the variety of dangers to which we have been exposed, and how
   miraculously our wants in many instances have been supplied, and our
   deliverances wrought, when even hope and human fortitude have become
   unequal to the conflict, we are unavoidably led to a serious and grateful
   sense of the manifold blessings which we have undeservedly received from
   the hand of that Being, from whom every good and perfect gift cometh.

   Impressed with these ideas, we conceive that it is our duty, and we
   rejoice that it is in our power, to extend a portion of that freedom to
   others, which has been extended to us, and release them from the state of
   thralldom, to which we ourselves were tyrannically doomed, and from which
   we have now every prospect of being delivered. It is not for us to inquire
   why, in the creation of mankind, the inhabitants of the several parts of
   the earth were distinguished by a difference in feature or complection. It
   is sufficient to know that all are the work of the Almighty Hand. We find
   in the distribution of the human species, that the most fertile as well as
   the most barren parts of the earth are inhabited by men of complexions
   different from ours, and from each other; from whence we may reasonably as
   well as religiously infer, that He, who placed them in their various
   situations, has extended equally His care and protection to all, and that
   it becomes not us to counteract His mercies.

   We esteem it a peculiar blessing granted to us, that we are enabled this
   day to add one more step to universal civilization, by removing, as much
   as possible, the sorrows of those who have lived in undeserved bondage,
   and from which, by the assumed authority of the kings of Great Britain, no
   effectual legal relief could be obtained. Weaned, by a long course of
   experience, from those narrow prejudices and partialities we had imbibed,
   we find our hearts enlarged with kindness and benevolence toward men of
   all conditions and nations; and we conceive ourselves at this particular
   period particularly called upon by the blessings which we have received,
   to manifest the sincerity of our profession, and to give a substantial
   proof of our gratitude.

   2. And whereas the condition of those persons, who have heretofore been
   denominated Negro and mulatto slaves, has been attended with
   circumstances, which not only deprived them of the common blessings that
   they were by nature entitled to, but has cast them into the deepest
   afflictions, by an unnatural separation and sale of husband and wife from
   each other and from their children, an injury, the greatness of which can
   only be conceived by supposing that we were in the same unhappy case. In
   justice, therefore, to persons so unhappily circumstanced, and who, having
   no prospect before them whereon they may rest their sorrows and their
   hopes, have no reasonable inducement to render their services to society,
   which they otherwise might, and also in grateful commemoration of our own
   happy deliverance from that state of unconditional submission to which we
   were doomed by the tyranny of Britain.

   3. Be it enacted, etc.
