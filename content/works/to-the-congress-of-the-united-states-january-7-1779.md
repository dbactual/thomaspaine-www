   To the Congress of the United States  January 7, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   From the manner in which I was called before the House yesterday, I have
   reason to suspect an unfavorable disposition in them towards some parts in
   my late publications. What the parts are against which they object, or
   what those objections are, are wholly unknown to me. If any gentleman has
   presented any Memorial to this House which contains any charge against me,
   or anyways alludes in a censurable manner to my character or interest, so
   as to become the ground of any such charge, I request, as a servant under
   your authority, an attested copy of that charge, and in my present
   character as a freeman of this country, I demand it. I attended at the bar
   of this House yesterday as their servant, though the warrant did not
   express my official station, which I conceive it ought to have done,
   otherwise it could not have been compulsive unless backed by a magistrate.
   My hopes were that I should be made acquainted with the charge, and
   admitted to my defence, which I am at all times ready to make either in
   writing or personally.

   I cannot in duty to my character as a freeman submit to be censured
   unheard. I have evidence which I presume will justify me. And I entreat
   this House to consider how great their reproach will be should it be told
   that they passed a sentence upon me without hearing me, and that a copy of
   the charge against me was refused to me; and likewise how much that
   reproach will be aggrevated should I afterwards prove the censure of this
   House to be a libel, grounded upon a mistake which they refused fully to
   inquire into.

   I make my application to the heart of every gentleman in this House, that,
   before he decides on a point that may affect my reputation, he will duly
   consider his own. Did I court popular praise I should not send this
   letter. My wish is that by thus stating my situation to the House, they
   may not commit an act they cannot justify.

   I have obtained fame, honor and credit in this country. I am proud of
   these honors. And as they cannot be taken from me by any unjust censure
   grounded on a concealed charge, therefore it will become my duty
   afterwards to do justice to myself. I have no favor to ask more than to be
   candidly and honorably dealt by; and such being my right I ought to have
   no doubt but this House will proceed accordingly. Should Congress be
   disposed to hear me, I have to request that they will give me sufficient
   time to prepare.

   I am Honorable Sirs, your honors most obedient and dutiful humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
