   To the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania   October 11, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   Some few days ago I presented a letter to this honorable Board stating the
   inconveniences which I lay under from an attention to public interest in
   preference to my own, to which I have received no reply. It is to me a
   matter of great concern to find in the government of this State, that
   which appears to be a disposition in them to neglect their friends and to
   throw discouragements in the way of genius and letters.

   At the particular request of the gentleman who presides at this Board, I
   took up the defence of the Constitution, at a time when he declared to me
   that unless he could be assisted he must give it up and quit the State; as
   matters then pressed too heavy upon him, and the opposition was gaining
   ground; yet this Board has since suffered me to combat with all the
   inconveniences incurred by that service, without any attention to my
   interest or my situation. For the sake of not dishonoring a cause, good in
   itself, I have hitherto been silent on these matters, but I cannot help
   expressing to this Board the concern I feel on this occasion, and the ill
   effect which such discouraging examples will have on those who might
   otherwise be disposed to act a& I have done.

   Having said this much, which is but a little part of which I am sensible,
   I have a request to make which if complied with will enable me to overcome
   the difficulties alluded to and to withdraw from a service in which I have
   experienced nothing but misfortune and neglect. I have an opportunity of
   importing a quantity of printing paper from France, and intend collecting
   my several pieces, beginning with Common Sense, into two volumes, and
   publishing them by subscription, with notes; but as I cannot think of
   beginning the subscription until the paper arrive, and as the undertaking
   exclusive of the paper, will be attended with more expense than I, who
   have saved money both in the service of the continent and the State, can
   bear, I should be glad to be assisted with the loan of fifteen hundred
   pounds for which I will give bond payable within a year. If this should
   not be complied with, I request that the services I have rendered may be
   taken into consideration and such compensation made me therefore as they
   shall appear to deserve.

   I am, honorable sirs, your obedient and humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
