   To his Excellency George Washington  January 31, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   SIR:

   Hearing that you leave this place tomorrow I beg you to accept a short
   reason why I have not waited on you.

   I have been out no where for near these two months. The part I have taken
   in an affair that is yet depending, rendered it most prudent in me to
   absent myself from company lest I should be asked questions improper to be
   answered, or subject myself to conversation that might have been
   unpleasant. That there has been foul play somewhere is clear to every
   one-and where it lies, will, I believe, soon come out.

   Having thus explained myself, I have to add my sincere wishes for your
   happiness in every line of life, and to assure you, that as far as my
   abilities extend I shall never suffer a hint of dishonor or even a
   deficiency of respect to you to pass unnoticed.

   I have always acted that part, and am confident that your virtues and
   conduct will ever require it from me as a duty as well as render it a
   pleasure.

   I never heard either Col. R. or Col. T. Lee express a sentiment in your
   disfavor. I can answer for nothing farther. I likewise take the liberty of
   mentioning to you that at the time some discontents from the army and the
   country last winter were doing you great injustice, I published the fifth
   No. of the Crisis. I hoped that by bringing your former services in view
   to shame them out, or at least to convince them of their error. I was then
   at Lancaster, and on my return to Yorktown I saw the foreign committee of
   which Col. R. H. Lee was chairman had sent off dispatches to France; the
   copy was in his handwriting and in these dispatches he enclosed that
   Pamphlet and spoke of it as "the general sentiments of America on what the
   Enemy had so boastingly called their successes."

   I am very desirous of bidding you farewell and intend making you a short
   visit today for that purpose, notwithstanding the reasons I have before
   mentioned.

   I am with every wish for your happiness, your obedient humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
