   To the Honorable Benjamin Franklin, Esqr.  May16, 1778

   YORKTOWN,

   DEAR SIR:

   In the Packet No. 1 I have sent you a long letter acknowledging your favor
   of Oct. 7. Mr. Temple Franklin's of March 1st which on account of the
   great quantity of public business I have not time to copy. Lest that
   should not come to hand, I write you this short information. Mr. [and]
   Mrs. Beache are at Mainheim near Lancaster; they were well a few days ago.
   I have not yet received the Pamphlets Mr. W. T. Franklin mentions. I think
   we are now so safely landed that it requires more invention to go wrong
   than it ever does to go right.

   I live in hopes of the pleasure of seeing you and taking your advice
   respecting the History of the Revolution as soon as matters make it
   practicable to come to Europe.

   I am dear Sir, Your obliged and affectionate humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. Please to present my thanks and compliments to Mr. W. T. Franklin. I
   have taken care to fulfill his command respecting the letters and
   Memorials he intrusted to my care, and that as soon as I can obtain
   sufficient information I will transmit it to him.

   I saw M. du Plessis lately he was well.
