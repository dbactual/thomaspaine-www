   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society

   YORKTOWN,  May 16th, 1778

   Dear Sir

   In the Packet No. 1 I have sent you a long letter acknowledging your favor
   of Oct. 7. Mr. Temple Franklin's of March 1st which on account of the
   great Quantity of public business I have not time to copy &mdash; lest that
   shd not come to hand, I write you this short information. 
   
   Mr. Mrs. Beache are at Mainheim near Lancaster, they were well a few days ago &mdash; 
   I have not yet received the Pamphlets Mr W T Franklin mentions. I think
   we are now so safely landed that it requires more invention to go wrong
   than it ever does to go right &mdash; 

   I live in hopes of the Pleasure of seeing you and taking your advice
   respecting the History of the Revolution as soon as matters make it
   practicable to come to Europe,

   I am Dr Sir your obliged and affectionate humble Servt

   T PAINE.

   P. S. Please to present my Thanks and complt to Mr W T Franklin &mdash; I
   have taken Care to fulfill his Command respecting the letters and
   Memorials he entrusted to my care, and that as soon as I can obtain
   sufficient Information I will transmit it to him.

   I saw M du Plessis lately he was well.
