   To James Monroe  [October 1794]

   DEAR SIR:

   As I have not yet received any answer to my last, I have amused myself
   with writing you the enclosed memoranda. Though you recommend patience to
   me I cannot but feel very pointedly the uncomfortableness of my situation,
   and among other reflections that occur to me I cannot think that America
   receives any credit from the long imprisonment that I suffer. It has the
   appearance of neglecting her citizens and her friends and of encouraging
   the insults of foreign nations upon them and upon her commerce. My
   imprisonment is as well and perhaps more known in England than in France,
   and they (the English) will not be intimidated from molesting an American
   ship when they see that one of her best citizens (for I have a right to
   call myself so) can be imprisoned in another country at the mere
   discretion of a committee, because he is a foreigner.

   When you first arrived everybody congratulated me that I should soon, if
   not immediately, be in liberty. Since that time about two hundred have
   been set free from this prison on the applications of their sections or of
   individuals-and I am continually hurt by the observations that are made
   -"that a section in Paris has more influence than America."

   It is right that I furnish you with these circumstances. It is the effect
   of my anxiety that the character of America suffer no reproach; for the
   world knows that I have acted a generous duty by her. I am the third
   American that has been imprisoned. Griffiths nine weeks, Haskins about
   five, and myself eight [months] and yet in prison. With respect to the two
   former there was then no Minister, for I consider Morris as none; and they
   were liberated on the applications of the Americans in Paris. As to myself
   I had rather be publicly and honorably reclaimed, though the reclamation
   was refused, than remain in the uncertain situation that I am. Though my
   health has suffered my spirits are not broken. I have nothing to fear
   unless innocence and fortitude be crimes.

   America, whatever may be my fate, will have no cause to blush for me as a
   citizen; I hope I shall have none to blush for her as a country.

   If, my dear Sir, there is anything in the perplexity of ideas I have
   mistaken, only suppose yourself in my situation, and you will easily find
   an excuse for it. I need not say how much I shall rejoice to pay my
   respects to you without-side the walls of this prison, and to inquire
   after my American friends. But I know that nothing can be accomplished
   here but by unceasing perseverance and application.

   Yours affectionately,

   THOMAS PAINE.
