                           *************************

   AS THE little amorous deity was one day winging his way over a village in
   Arcadia, he was drawn by the sweet sound of the pipe and tabor, to descend
   and see what was the matter. The gods themselves are sometimes ravished
   with the simplicity of mortals. The groves of Arcadia were once the
   country seats of the celestials, where they relaxed from the business of
   the skies, and partook of the diversions of the villagers. Cupid being
   descended, was charmed with the lovely appearance of the place. Every
   thing he saw had an air of pleasantness. Every shepherd was in his holiday
   dress, and every shepherdess was decorated with a profusion of flowers.
   The sound of labor was not heard among them. The little cottages had a
   peaceable look, and were almost hidden with arbors of jessamine and
   myrtle. The way to the temple was strewn with flowers, and enclosed with a
   number of garlands and green arches. Surely, quoth Cupid, here is a
   festival today. I'll hasten and inquire the matter.

   So saying, he concealed his bow and quiver, and took a turn through the
   village. As he approached a building distinguished from all the rest by
   the elegance of its appearance, he heard a sweet confusion of voices
   mingled with instrumental music. What is the matter, said Cupid to a swain
   who was sitting under a sycamore by the way-side, and humming a very
   melancholy tune, why are you not at the feast, and why are you so sad? I
   sit here, answered the swain, to see a sight, and a sad sight 'twill be.
   What is it, said Cupid, come tell me, for perhaps I can help you. I was
   once happier than a king, replied the swain, and was envied by all the
   shepherds of the place, but now everything is dark and gloomy,
   because-Because what? said Cupid-Because I am robbed of my Ruralinda.
   Gothic, the Lord of the manor, hath stolen her from me, and this is to be
   the nuptial day. A wedding, quoth Cupid, and I know nothing of it, you
   must be mistaken, shepherd, I keep a record of marriages, and no such
   thing has come to my knowledge. 'Tis no wedding, I assure you, if I am not
   consulted about it. The Lord of the manor, continued the shepherd,
   consulted nobody but Ruralinda's mother, and she longed to see her fair
   daughter the Lady of the manor. He hath spent a deal of money to make all
   this appearance, for money will do anything; I only wait here to see her
   come by, and then farewell to the hills and dales. Cupid bade him not be
   rash, and left him. This is another of Hymen's tricks, quoth Cupid to
   himself, he hath frequently served me thus, but I'll hasten to him, and
   have it out with him. So saying, he repaired to the mansion. Everything
   there had an air of grandeur rather than of joy, sumptuous but not serene.
   The company were preparing to walk in procession to the temple. The Lord
   of the manor looked like the father of the village, and the business he
   was upon gave a foolish awkwardness to his age and dignity. Ruralinda
   smiled, because she would smile, but in that smile was sorrow. Hymen with
   a torch faintly burning on one side only stood ready to accompany them.
   The gods when they please can converse in silence, and in that language
   Cupid began on Hymen.

    Know, Hymen, said he, that I am your master. Indulgent Jove gave you to
   me as a clerk, not as a rival, much less a superior. 'Tis my province to
   form the union, and yours to witness it. But of late you have
   treacherously assumed to set up for yourself. 'Tis true you may chain
   couples together like criminals, but you cannot yoke them like lovers;
   besides you are such a dull fellow when I am not with you, that you poison
   the felicities of life. You have not a grace but what is borrowed from me.
   As well may the moon attempt to enlighten the earth without the sun, as
   you to bestow happiness when I am absent. At best you are but a temporal
   and a temporary god, whom Jove has appointed not to bestow, but to secure
   happiness, and restrain the infidelity of mankind. But assure yourself
   that I'll complain of you to the synod.

   This is very high indeed, replied Hymen, to be called to an account by
   such a boy of a god as you are. You are not of such importance in the
   world as your vanity thinks; for my own part I have enlisted myself with
   another master, and can very well do without you. Plutus (God of
   riches.-Author.) and I are greater than Cupid; you may complain and
   welcome, for Jove himself descended in a silver shower and conquered: and
   by the same power the Lord of the manor hath won a damsel, in spite of all
   the arrows in your quiver.

   Cupid, incensed at this reply, resolved to support his authority, and
   expose the folly of Hymen's pretentions to independence. As the quarrel
   was carried on in silence, the company were not interrupted by it. The
   procession began to set forward to the temple, where the ceremony was to
   be performed. The Lord of the manor led the beautiful Ruralinda like a
   lamb devoted to sacrifice. Cupid immediately despatched a petition for
   assistance to- his mother on one of the sun-beams, and the same messenger
   returning in an instant, informed him that whatever he wished should be
   done. He immediately cast the old lord and Ruralinda into one of the most
   extraordinary sleeps ever known. They continued walking in the procession,
   talking to each other, and observing every ceremony with as much order as
   if they had been awake; their souls had in a manner crept from their
   bodies, as snakes creep from their skin, and leave the perfect appearance
   of themselves behind. And so rapidly does imagination change the landscape
   of life, that in the same space of time which passed over while they were
   walking to the temple, they both ran through, in a strange variety of
   dreams, seven years of wretched matrimony. In which imaginary time, Gothic
   experienced all the mortification which age wedded to youth must expect;
   and she all the infelicity which such a sale and sacrifice of her person
   justly deserved.

   In this state of reciprocal discontent they arrived at the temple. Cupid
   still continued them in their slumber, and in order to expose the
   consequences of such marriages, he wrought so magically on the
   imaginations of them both, that he drove Gothic distracted at the supposed
   infidelity of his wife, and she mad with joy at the supposed death of her
   husband; and just as the ceremony was about to be performed, each of them
   broke out into such passionate soliloquies, as threw the whole company
   into confusion. He exclaiming, she rejoicing; he imploring death to
   relieve him, and she preparing to bury him; gold, quoth Ruralinda, may be
   bought too dear, but the grave has befriended me. The company believing
   them mad, conveyed them away, Gothic to his mansion, and Ruralinda to her
   cottage. The next day they awoke, and being grown wise without loss of
   time, or the pain of real experience, they mutually declined proceeding
   any farther. The old lord continued as he was, and generously bestowed a
   handsome dowry on Ruralinda, who was soon after wedded to the young
   shepherd, that had piteously bewailed the loss of her. The authority of
   Cupid was re-established, and Hymen ordered never more to appear in the
   village, unless Cupid introduced him.

   Esop.
