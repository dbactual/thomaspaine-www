   DEAR SIR:

   I send you a sketch of a Plan that I believe is new in this country. The
   idea originated with Franklin. This is sufficient to procure it attention.
   I have done no more than apply it to the circumstances France is now in.
   The letter addressed to Sir Robert Smith is in answer to one he wrote to
   Mr. Millbank respecting the Iron Bridge at Sunderland. I send it because
   it is referred to in the plan and also a perspecting painting of the
   Bridge.

   As for myself I have no object in view in this Country otherwise than I
   crave its prosperity. My intention is to return to America as soon as I
   can cross the sea in safety. The letter to Sir Robt. and the view of the
   Bridge I shall want again. The plan I make you a present of wishing you
   would endeavor to bring it into practice, which is the only motive I have
   in sending it.

   Yours with esteem,

   THOMAS PAINE.
