   To the Congress of the United States  September 27, 1785

   As there is now a report founded on a former resolve, depending before
   Congress, respecting a compensation to me for my service to the States
   during the war and the progress of the revolution, I request leave, on
   this particular occasion, to address the following to Congress.

   That my intention in coming to America was that of settling as a private
   gentleman; that the troubles of the country and the war commencing within
   four months after my arrival, I had the choice either of returning or
   sharing her fate; that impressed with the justice of her cause and the
   dangers of her situation I preferred the latter, and felt it a duty due to
   the common rights of mankind to render such service and assistance in my
   power, which I most faithfully did; that as I had no ambitious motives or
   views when I began, so have I none now.

   If Congress will please to order my private expenses to be reimbursed me,
   which I have naturally incurred by my service to the States, I desire no
   more.

   What those expenses are may easily be judged of by any gentleman present
   who has resided in any of the cities of America. During a period of nearly
   eleven years they cannot possibly have been less than six thousand
   dollars.

   I likewise make it my request that this letter may be put on the journals
   of Congress, and that the matter of it may be proceeded on before the
   rising of Congress today.

   Wishing Peace and Happiness to the United States, I remain,

   THOMAS PAINE.
