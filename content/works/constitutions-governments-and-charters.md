   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Paine wrote this essay, which was published in pamphlet form in June,
   1805, to prove the unconstitutionality of the power assumed by the New
   York legislature to grant charters. He argues that the entire object of
   annual elections would be defeated "if any one legislature, during the
   year of its authority, had the power to place any of its acts beyond the
   reach of succeeding legislatures; yet this is always attempted to be done
   in those acts of a legislature called charters." Paine proposes that all
   kinds of "extraordinary legislation," such as those involving land grants
   and incorporations of companies, should be passed only by a legislature
   succeeding the one in which it was proposed. The spirit of the essay
   reflects the popular opposition to chartered monopolies.

   THE people of Pennsylvania are, at this time, earnestly occupied on the
   subject of calling a convention to revise their State Constitution, and
   there can be but little doubt that a revision is necessary. It is a
   Constitution, they say, for the emolument of lawyers.

   It has happened that the constitutions of all the states were formed
   before any experience had been had on the representative system of
   government; and it would be a miracle in human affairs that mere theory
   without experience should start into perfection at once. The Constitution
   of New York was formed so early as the year 1777.

   The subject that occupied and engrossed the mind of the public at that
   time was the Revolutionary War, and the establishment of independence, and
   in order to give effect to the Declaration of Independence by Congress it
   was necessary that the states severally should make a practical beginning
   by establishing state constitutions, and trust to time and experience for
   improvement. The general defect in all the constitutions is that they are
   modeled too much after the system, if it can be called a system, of the
   English Government, which in practise is the most corrupt system in
   existence, for it is corruption systematized.

   An idea also generally prevailed at that time of keeping what were called
   the legislative, the executive, and the judicial powers distinct and
   separated from each other. But this idea, whether correct or not, is
   always contradicted in practise; for where the consent of a governor or
   executive is required to an act before it can become a law, or where he
   can by his negative prevent an act of the legislature becoming a law, he
   is effectually a part of the legislature, and possesses full one-half of
   the powers of a whole legislature.

   In this State (New York) this power is vested in a select body of men,
   composed of the executive, by which is to be understood the governor, the
   chancellor, and the judges, and called the Council of Revision. This is
   certainly better than vesting that power in an individual, if it is
   necessary to invest it anywhere; but is a direct contradiction to the
   maxim set up, that those powers ought to be kept separate; for here the
   executive and the judiciary are united into one power, acting
   legislatively.

   When we see maxims that fail in practise, we ought to go to the root, and
   see if the maxim be true. Now it does not signify how many nominal
   divisions, and sub-divisions, and classifications we make, for the fact
   is, there are but two powers in any government, the power of willing or
   enacting the laws, and the power of executing them; for what is called the
   judiciary is a branch of executive power; it executes the laws; and what
   is called the executive is a superintending power to see that the laws are
   executed.

   Errors in theory are, sooner or later, accompanied with errors in
   practise; and this leads me to another part of the subject, that of
   considering a constitution and a government relatively to each other.

   A constitution is the act of the people in their original character of
   sovereignty. A government is a creature of the constitution; it is
   produced and brought into existence by it. A constitution defines and
   limits the powers of the government it creates. It therefore follows, as a
   natural and also a logical result, that the governmental exercise of any
   power not authorized by the constitution is an assumed power, and
   therefore illegal.

   There is no article in the Constitution of this State, nor of any of the
   states, that invests the Government in whole or in part with the power of
   granting charters or monopolies of any kind; the spirit of the times was
   then against all such speculation; and therefore the assuming to grant
   them is unconstitutional, and when obtained by bribery and corruption is
   criminal. It is also contrary to the intention and principle of annual
   elections.

   Legislatures are elected annually, not only for the purpose of giving the
   people, in their elective character, the opportunity of showing their
   approbation of those who have acted right, by re-electing them, and
   rejecting those who have acted wrong; but also for the purpose of
   correcting the wrong (where any wrong has been done) of a former
   legislature. But the very intention, essence and principle of annual
   election would be destroyed if any one legislature, during the year of its
   authority, had the power to place any of its acts beyond the reach of
   succeeding legislatures; yet this is always attempted to be done in those
   acts of a legislature called charters.

   Of what use is it to dismiss legislators for having done wrong, if the
   wrong is to continue on the authority of those who did it ? Thus much for
   things that are wrong. I now come to speak of things that are right and
   may be necessary.

   Experience shows that matters will occasionally arise, especially in a new
   country, that will require the exercise of a power differently constituted
   to that of ordinary legislation; and therefore there ought to be in a
   constitution an article defining how that power shall be constituted and
   exercised. Perhaps the simplest method, that which I am going to mention,
   is the best; because it is still keeping strictly within the limits of
   annual elections, makes no new appointments necessary and creates no
   additional expense. For example,

   That all matters of a different quality to matters of ordinary
   legislation, such, for instance, as sales or grants of public lands, acts
   of incorporation, public contracts with individuals or companies beyond a
   certain amount, shall be proposed in one legislature, and published in the
   form of a bill, with the yeas and nays, after the second reading, and in
   that state shall lie over to be taken up by the succeeding legislature;
   that is, there shall always be, on all such matters, one annual election
   [which] takes place between the time of bringing in the bill and the time
   of enacting it into a permanent law.

   It is the rapidity with which a self-interested speculation, or a fraud on
   the public property, can be carried through within the short space of one
   session, and before the people can be apprised of it, that renders it
   necessary that a precaution of this kind, unless a better can be devised,
   should be made an article of the Constitution.

   Had such an article been originally in the Constitution, the bribery and
   corruption employed to seduce and manager the members of the late
   Legislature, in the affair of the Merchants' Bank, could not have taken
   place. It would not have been worthwhile to bribe men to do what they had
   not the power of doing. That Legislature could only have proposed, but not
   have enacted the law; and the election then ensuing would, by discarding
   the proposers, have negatived the proposal without any further trouble.

   This method has the appearance of doubling the value and importance of
   annual elections. It is only by means of elections that the mind of the
   public can be collected to a point on any important subject; and as it is
   always the interest of a much greater number of people in a country to
   have a thing right than to have it wrong, the public sentiment is always
   worth attending to. It may sometimes err, but never intentionally, and
   never long.

   The experiment of the Merchants' Bank shows it is impossible to bribe a
   small body of men, but it is always impossible to bribe a whole nation;
   and therefore in all legislative matters that by requiring permanency
   differ from acts of ordinary legislation, which are alterable or
   repealable at all times, it ij safest that they pass through two
   legislatures, and a general election intervene between. The elections will
   always bring up the mind of the country on any important proposed bill;
   and thus the whole State will be its own Council of Revision. It has
   already passed its veto on the Merchants' Bank bill, notwithstanding the
   minor Council of Revision approved it.

   COMMON SENSE.
