   To Thomas Jefferson January 30, 1806

   NEW ROCHELLE,

   DEAR SIR:

   I have not seen nor heard anything respecting the subject I wrote to you
   upon and also to the vice-president [George Clinton] after his arrival at
   Washington. His letter, however, is on a different subject, and which I
   introduce without meaning that the one should interfere with the other.

   The affairs of Europe are now reaching a crisis that merits and demands
   the attention of the United States. If ever a law of nations shall be
   established and the freedom and safety of the seas secured it must be in a
   crisis like the present. In the course of this letter I intend to make you
   an offer on this subject, but I will first detail, as concisely as I can,
   my opinion of the present state of things and their probable event.

   Bonaparte has done what required no gift of prophecy to foresee; that is,
   that he would attack the Austrians before the Russians arrived; and
   secondly that if he defeated the Austrians the Russians would not fight.

   At the time of beginning this letter we have news from Paris to the 20th
   November and from Bordeaux to the 26th. Bonaparte was then on the point of
   entering Vienna. This I think will terminate the war on the continent. The
   question in this case will be, what will Bonaparte do with respect to
   England? Will he make a general peace by a congress for the purpose that
   shall include England, or will he make a continental peace arid leave
   England out? My opinion is that he will do the latter and I hope he will.
   This is what he did in the last treaty of peace with Austria and what is
   best for him to do now. The matters he has to settle with England, in
   whatever way it may be done, whether by a descent or by harassing the
   English government out by continual alarms and expense, are of a nature
   different to the affairs of the continent and ought not to be blended with
   them. The one regards the sea; the other the land. But I think England
   will try to make it a congressional affair and that Harronby is gone to
   the continent to lie by for that purpose. It is the last use the English
   government can make of the coalition it has been at the expense of
   raising.

   But the case with Bonaparte will be, that if he defeats the present
   coalition which I have every moral certainty that he will, and dictate a
   peace to Austria, for he cares nothing about Russia, he will have it more
   in his power to act against England than he had before. Pitt is a poor,
   short-sighted politician-a man of expedients instead of system. It is easy
   to see that this coalition was formed to ward off from England the
   meditated invasion, but then Pitt ought to have taken into the calculation
   what the event and consequences would be if it failed. It was a measure of
   great and certain expense with uncertain and shadowy prospects of
   advantage, and very perilous consequences if it miscarried. A general is a
   fool and a politician is the same, who fights a battle he might avoid, and
   where the disasters if he is beaten far outweighs the advantages if he
   succeeds. This inclines me sometimes to think that the plan, in forming
   this coalition, was not actual war, but that it was to hang on the rear of
   Bonaparte and to harass, alarm and frighten him into a peace that England
   should dictate. If this was the scheme Mack was a fit instrument of
   intrigue for the purpose, but if it was actual war he was the poorest
   creature they could choose, and in either case, it shows that Pitt was not
   a judge of the character and constitution of his enemy, for Bonaparte is
   not a man to be frightened or cajoled or deterred from the pursuance of
   his object by apprehension of danger and difficulties. I think he will be
   at Boulogne again in the spring and put the English government in a
   terrible fright. He will then have no enemy hanging on his rear.

   I am not certain if you know that the plan for a descent upon England by
   gunboats was proposed by myself. I wrote the whole plan at Mr. Skipwith's
   house in the country and showed it first to Mr. Monroe. Lathenas a friend
   of ours and member of the convention translated it into French and I sent
   it with the original in English to the directory who immediately set about
   building the boats. They then appointed Bonaparte commander in chief of
   the army of England (l'armie d'angleterre) and by an agreement between him
   and me at his own home I was to accompany him. I know his opinion upon
   that expedition. He puts the whole upon landing. His expression to me was,
   "Only let us land." If he makes the descent I think he will give the
   command of it to his brother in law Murat and that he is training him up
   for the purpose. Nelson's victory, as the English papers call it, will
   have no influence on the campaign nor on the descent. It never was
   intended to employ ships of the line on that expedition.

   I have already spoken my opinion of what Bonaparte will do with respect to
   peace, that is, he will make a continental peace and leave England out, I
   have some lights to go by in forming this opinion. As Bonaparte paid me
   the compliment of supposing that I knew more about England and the plans
   and politics of its government than people in France generally did, he
   sent a person to me when the last treaty of peace with Austria was to
   begin, with the following question: Whether in negotiating a treaty of
   peace with Austria it will be policy in France to enter into a treaty of
   peace with England? I gave him my answer fully and explicitly in the
   negative with the reasons upon which that decision was founded and I sent
   you a copy of that answer with several other papers, by the return of the
   vessel that brought Mr. Elsworth to France. I suppose Bonaparte had a mind
   to hear how I would answer the question, but had formed his own conclusion
   before he sent it. Be this however as it may I gave him several reasons
   which could not occur to him from the want of the local knowledge of
   England I possessed myself.

   After the treaty of peace with Austria was concluded, and the war with
   England still continuing, I wrote and published my plan of an Unarmed
   Neutrality for the protection of commerce. I had thrown out some general
   outlines of this plan in a publication of mine on the events of 18
   Brumaire 1796 but in that which I published in 1801 of which I sent you a
   manuscript copy in English I reduced it to a regular system. My letters to
   you which accompanied the plan showed the progress it was making, which
   the assassination of Paul of Russia put a stop to. I had sent him two
   copies in French by the hands of a person who was going to Petersburgh and
   who desired to be the bearer of them.

   Bonaparte has declared in several of his proclamations that his object, so
   far as respects foreign commerce, is the freedom and safety of the seas,
   and as it is an object that suits with the greatness of his ambition and
   with the temper of his genius which is cast for great exploits, and also
   with the interest of France, I believe him. This also is an object that
   merits the attention of the United States; but before I speak more
   particularly to this point I will state the situations Bonaparte will soon
   be in and out of which his future politics will grow.

   In the first place; infering what he will do, from what he has done, he
   will make a continental peace and undertake England afterwards. In this
   case he will either dictate a peace on his own terms, or make a descent,
   and the conduct itself of the English government demonstrates that it
   looks on a descent as a practicable thing. If he make a descent and
   succeed he will hold the power of both nations, by sea and land in his own
   hands, and very probably will annihilate the present government of England
   and form a new one, and put one of his brothers or his brother- in-law,
   Murat, at the head of it. This will put an end to naval wars, and
   consequently to the pretense of capturing vessels of commerce, and so far
   the world will be the better for it. The dynasty of the Guelphs have
   continued ninety two years which is somewhat longer than the dynasty of
   the Stuarts continued.

   If instead of a descent he makes a treaty of peace the question is, how is
   the freedom of the seas to be made secure? The short answer is, that
   inability to do mischief is the best security against mischief. In the
   second part of Rights of Man I spoke of France and England coming to an
   agreement to reduce the navies of both nations and to oblige all other
   nations to do the same, and in the appendix to my letter to the Abbe
   Raynal 1782 (I have not the work by me) I have spoken of the folly of
   increasing navies.

   Every victory at sea is a victory of loss. The nation who loses the ships
   in an action is eased of the expense of supporting them and the nation who
   takes them is additionally burdened with it. I observed that the annual
   naval expenses of England in her last war increased as her naval conquests
   increased. The last naval estimate for that year that I saw was upwards of
   fourteen millions dollars, which is equal to the amount of all the
   land-tax in England for seven years. The annual land-tax in England is two
   millions sterling stationary. Every county pays its annual quota of that
   sum.

   This proposal for a mutual reduction of navies was popular in England
   because I applied it as one of the principal means for reducing taxes.
   There ought to be no such vessels as ships of the line, and the number of
   frigates should be limited. It is because one nation has ships of the line
   that another nation has them; whereas if neither had them the balance
   would be even and the world's high sea, the ocean, be less interrupted.
   This would be the best naval victory that Bonaparte could make and the
   world would be the better for it.

   In the treaty of peace between France and England in 1783 one of the
   articles was that only six ships of the line should be kept in commission
   by either nation and commissioners were appointed by each party to see the
   article carried into execution. Why not go the whole length and say there
   shall be no ships of the line in existence, and that the number of
   frigates shall be limited. If a measure of this kind could be carried a
   law of nations could the more easily be established because the means of
   violating that law would be very much lessened. The rights of the seas
   ought to be under the guarantee of all nations.

   You will know by the month of April or May what the state of things are
   between France and England, for in the event either of a treaty of peace
   if it includes the freedom of the seas and the abolition of all assumed
   sovereignty over them or of a successful descent upon England, the United
   States cannot consistently remain a silent inactive spectator. They must
   do something to meet the new order of circumstances and to give them some
   claim to be heard on the subject of rights. I was pleased at the bill
   brought in by Mr. Wright respecting the impressments.

   Congress have now before them a Memorial from the merchants of New York.
   It seems to me to have been extorted from them by their losses rather than
   by their patriotism. However, as far as it goes it affords ground for
   Congress to act upon. There is nothing will make an impression on the
   government of England but a suspension of commerce with that country; a
   non-importation and I am persuaded Congress would do right to pass an act
   for this purpose empowering the executive to put it in execution when he
   shall judge proper and to send information of it to the American minister
   at London to be communicated to the English government. It ought also to
   be sent to the American minister at Paris. Bonaparte will then see we are
   taking measures that are in concert with his declarations, and it is
   always good policy to stand well with the conquerer if it can be done on a
   good principle.

   If he makes a descent and succeed (and it is as probable he will be in
   London in six months as it was six months ago that he would be in Vienna,
   and that his brother George will have to run for it as his brother Francis
   has done) he will have it in his power to make his own' law of nations, in
   doing which he ought to remember, I hope, at least he will not forget,
   that he owes the project of a descent to an American citizen.

   I have now given you a summary of some of the principal matters that have
   come to my knowledge while in France and in which I have been an actor,
   and I have also stated to you my opinion of the consequences that will
   follow. I think you will find it proper, perhaps necessary, to send a
   person to France in the event either of a treaty of peace or of a descent,
   and I make you an offer of my services on that occasion to join Mr.
   Monroe. I do this because I do not think there is a person in the United
   States that can render so much service on the business that will come on
   as myself; and as I have had a considerable, I might say, a principle
   share in bringing forward the great matters that now occupy the theatre of
   politics it will be agreeable to me to have some share in the conclusion
   of them; for though we cannot now make countries free, it will be a great
   point gained to make the seas free.

   We have no news yet (January 27) of the entry of Bonaparte into Vienna.
   The latest news is that by the highland Mary of Norfolk. I think that when
   he enters Vienna he will make a handsome proclamation to the people of
   that city, and as it will be republished and read by the people of England
   he may make it serve the purpose of a proclamation to them. I expect he
   will curtail the Austrian Emperor's dominions and disable him from
   breaking any more treaties, and then he will considerably en- large his
   kingdom of Italy out of the territories he relinquished to Austria at the
   last peace.

   If Bonaparte succeed in a descent (and all things are now possible) he
   will put an end to the English East India company. In that case will he
   throw the trade open or will he make a monopoly of it for France and his
   new government of England? I think he will let Holland in for a share, but
   will he let the United States in is a matter worth thinking about, and
   also the West India trade. If reports of him are true he will not make
   peace with England without shutting her and Russia out of the
   Mediterranean. In the new order of things which the present war has
   provoked into existence many new circumstances will arise which by being
   foreseen may be guarded against or turned to advantage. As I think that
   letters from a friend and to a friend have some claim to an answer it will
   be agreeable to me to receive an answer to this, but without any wish that
   you should commit yourself, neither can you be a judge of what is proper
   or necessary to be done till about the month of April or May. In the
   meantime you have my offer. Please to present my respects to Governor
   Clinton.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.
