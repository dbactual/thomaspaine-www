   The word Sabbath, means REST; that is, cessation from labor, but the
   stupid Blue Laws (They were called Blue Laws because they were originally
   printed on blue paper.-Author.) of Connecticut make a labor of rest, for
   they oblige a person to sit still from sunrise to sunset on a Sabbath-day,
   which is hard work. Fanaticism made those laws, and hypocrisy pretends to
   reverence them, for where such laws prevail hypocrisy will prevail also.

   One of those laws says, "No person shall run on a Sabbath-day, nor walk in
   his garden, nor elsewhere; but reverently to and from meeting." These
   fanatical hypocrites forgot that God dwells not in temples made with
   hands, and that the earth is full of His glory.

   One of the finest scenes and subjects of religious contemplation is to
   walk into the woods and fields, and survey the works of the God of the
   Creation. The wide expanse of heaven, the earth covered with verdure, the
   lofty forest, the waving corn, the magnificent roll of mighty rivers, and
   the murmuring melody of the cheerful brooks, are scenes that inspire the
   mind with gratitude and delight.

   But this the gloomy Calvinist of Connecticut must not behold on a
   Sabbath-day. Entombed within the walls of his dwelling, he shuts from his
   view the Temple of Creation. The sun shines no joy to him. The gladdening
   voice of nature calls on him in vain. He is deaf, dumb and blind to
   everything around that God has made. Such is the Sabbath-day of
   Connecticut.

   From whence could come this miserable notion of devotion? It comes from
   the gloominess of the Calvinistic creed. If men love darkness rather than
   light, because their works are evil, the ulcerated mind of a Calvinist,
   who sees God only in terror, and sits brooding over the scenes of hell and
   damnation, can have no joy in beholding the glories of the creation.
   Nothing in that mighty and wondrous system accords with his principles or
   his devotion.

   He sees nothing there that tells him that God created millions on purpose
   to be damned, and that the children of a span long are born to burn
   forever in hell. The creation preaches a different doctrine to this. We
   there see that the care and goodness of God is extended impartially over
   all the creatures He has made. The worm of the earth shares His protection
   equally with the elephant of the desert. The grass that springs beneath
   our feet grows by His bounty as well as the cedars of Lebanon.

   Everything in the creation reproaches the Calvinist with unjust ideas of
   God, and disowns the hardness and ingratitude of his principles. Therefore
   he shuns the sight of them on a Sabbath-day.

   AN ENEMY TO CANT AND IMPOSITION.
