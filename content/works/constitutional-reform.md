   THOMAS PAINE TO THE CITIZENS OF PENNSYLVANIA ON THE PROPOSAL FOR CALLING A CONVENTION

   I resided in the capital of your State (Philadelphia) in the "*time that
   tried men's souls,*" and all my political writings, during the Revolutionary
   War, were written in that city, it seems natural for me to look back to
   the place of my political and literary birth, and feel an interest for its
   happiness. Removed as I now am from the place, and detached from
   everything of personal party, I address this token to you on the ground of
   principle, and in remembrance of former times and friendships.

   The subject now before you is the call of a Convention to examine and, if
   necessary, to reform the constitution of the state; or to speak in the
   correct language of constitutional order, to propose written articles of
   reform to be accepted or rejected by the people by vote, in the room of
   those now existing, that shall be judged improper or defective.
   There cannot be, on the ground of reason, any objection to this; because
   if no reform or alteration is necessary, the sense of the country will
   permit none to be made; and *if necessary*, it *will* be made because it
   *ought* to be made. Until, therefore, the sense of the country can be
   collected, and made known by a convention elected for that purpose, all
   opposition to the call of a convention not only passes for nothing, but
   serves to create a suspicion that the opposers are conscious that the
   Constitution will not bear an examination.

   The constitution formed by the convention of 1776, of which Benjamin
   Franklin (the greatest and most useful man America has yet produced) was
   president, had many good points in it which were overthrown by the
   Convention of 1790, under the pretense of making the constitution
   conformable to that of the United States; as if the forms and periods of
   election for a territory extensive as that of the United States is, could
   become a rule for a single state.

   The principal defect in the constitution of 1776, was, that it was subject
   in practice, to too much precipitancy, but the ground work of that
   constitution was good. The present constitution appears to me to be
   clogged with inconsistencies of a hazardous tendency, as a supposed remedy
   against a precipitancy that might not happen. Investing any individual, by
   whatever name or official title he may be called, with a negative over the
   formation of the laws, is copied from the English government, without ever
   perceiving the inconsistency and absurdity of it, when applied to the
   representative system, or understanding the origin of it in England.

   The present form of government in England and all those things called
   prerogatives of the Crown, of which this negative power is one, was
   established by conquest and not by compact. Their origin was the conquest of
   England by the Normans under William of Normandy, surnamed the Conqueror,
   in 1066, and the genealogy of its kings takes its date from him. He is the
   first of the list. &mdash; There is no historical certainty of the time when parliaments began; but
   be the time when it may, they began by what are called grants or charters
   from the Norman conqueror or his successors to certain towns, and to
   counties, to elect members to meet and serve in parliament (1) subject to his controul; and the
   custom still continues with the king of England calling the parliament *my
   parliament*;" that is a parliament originating from his authority and over
   which he holds controul in right of himself, derived from that conquest.
   It is from this assumed right, derived from conquest, and not from any
   constitutional right by compact, that kings of England hold a negative
   over the formation of the laws; and they hold this for the purpose of
   preventing any being enacted that might abridge, invade, or in any way
   affect or diminish what they claim to be their hereditary or family rights
   and prerogatives, derived originally from the conquest of the country. (2) This is the origin of the king
   of England's negative. It is a badge of disgrace which *his* parliaments are
   obliged to wear, and to which they are abject enough to submit.

   But what has this case to do with a legislature chosen by freemen on
   their own authority, in right of themselves? Or in what manner does a
   person stiled governor or chief magistrate, resemble a conqueror
   subjugating a country, as William of Normandy subjugated England, and
   saying to it *you shall have no laws but what I please?*
   The negativing power in a country like America, is of that kind, that a
   wise man would not choose to be embarrassed with it, and a man fond of
   using it will be overthrown by it. It is not difficult to see that when
   Mr. M'Kean negatived the arbitration act he was induced to it as a
   *lawyer*, for the benefit of the profession, and not as a *magistrate* for
   the benefit of the people; for it is the office of a chief magistrate to
   compose differences and *prevent* law suits.
   If the people chuse to have arbitration instead of law suits, why should
   they not have them? It is a matter that concerns them as individuals and
   not as a state or community; and is not a proper case for a governor to
   interfere in, for it is not a state or government concern; nor does it
   concern the peace thereof, otherwise than to make it more peaceable by
   making it less contentious.

   This negativing power in the hands of an individual ought to be
   constitutionally abolished. It is a dangerous power. There is no
   prescribing rules for the use of it. It is discretionary and arbitrary;
   and the will and temper of the person at any time possessing it, is its
   only rule. 
   
   There must have been great want of reflection in the convention
   that admitted it into the constitution. Would that convention have put the
   constitution it had formed (whether good or bad) in the power of any
   individual to negative? It would not. It would have treated such a
   proposal with disdain. Why then did it put the legislatures thereafter to
   be chosen, and all the laws in that predicament? 
   Had that Convention, or the law members thereof, known the origin of the
   negativing power used by kings of England, from whence they copied it,
   they must have seen the inconsistency of introducing it into an American
   constitution. We are not a conquered people; we know no conqueror; and the
   negativing power used by kings in England is for the defence of the
   personal and family prerogative of the successors of the conqueror
   against the parliament and the people. What is all this to us? We know no
   prerogatives but what belong to the sovereignty of ourselves.

   At the time this constitution was formed, there was a great departure from
   the principles of the revolution, among those who then assumed the lead,
   and the country was grossly imposed upon. This accounts for some
   inconsistencies that are to be found in the present constitution, among
   which is the negativing power inconsistently copied from England. While
   the exercise of the power over the state remained dormant it remained
   unnoticed; but the instant it began to be active it began to alarm; and
   the exercise of it against the rights of the people to settle their
   private pecuniary differences by the peaceable mode of arbitration,
   without the interference of lawyers, and the expence of tediousness of
   courts of law, has brought its existence to a crisis.

   Arbitration is of more importance to society than courts of law, and ought
   to have precedence of them in all cases of pecuniary concerns between
   individuals or parties of them. Who are better qualified than merchants to
   settle disputes between merchants, or who better than farmers to settle
   disputes between farmers? And the same for every other description of men.
   What do lawyers or courts of law know of these matters? They devote
   themselves to forms rather than to principles; and the merits of the case
   become obscure and lost in a labyrinth of verbal perplexities. &mdash; We do not
   hear of lawyers going to law with each other, tho' they could do it
   cheaper than other people &mdash; which shows they have no opinion of it for
   themselves.

   The principle and rule of arbitration ought to be constitutionally
   established. The honest sense of a country collected in convention will
   find out how to do this without the interference of lawyers who may be
   hired to advocate any side of any cause; for the case is, the practice of
   the bar is become a species of prostitution that ought to be controuled.
   It lives by encouraging the injustice it pretends to redress.

   Courts in which law is practiced are of two kinds. The one for criminal
   cases; the other for civil cases; or cases between individuals respecting
   property of any kind or the value thereof. I know not what may be the
   numerical proportion of these two classes of cases to each other; but that
   the civil cases are far more numerous than the criminal cases I make no
   doubt of. Whether they be ten, twenty, thirty or forty to one, or more, I
   leave to those who live in the state, or in the several counties thereof,
   to determine.

   But be the proportion what it may, the expence to the public of supporting
   a judiciary for both will be in some relative degree according to  the
   number of cases the one bears to the other; yet it is only one of the
   that the public, as a public, have any concern with. 
   
   The criminal cases, being breaches of the peace, are consequently under the cognizance of  the
   government of the state, and the expence of supporting the courts thereof
   belongs to the public, because the preservation of the peace is a public
   concern.

   But civil cases, that is, cases of private property between individuals,
   belong wholly to the individuals themselves; and all that government has
   consistently to do in the matter, is to establish the process by which the
   parties concerned shall proceed and bring the matter to decision
   themselves, by referring it to impartial and judicious men of the
   neighbourhood, of their own chusing. &mdash; This is by far the most convenient,
   as to time and place, and the cheapest method to them; for it is bringing
   *justice home to their own doors* without the chicanery of law and lawyers. &mdash; 
   Every case ought to be determined on its own merits, without the farce of
   what are called precedents, or reports of cases; because, in the first
   place, it often happens that the decision upon the case brought as a
   precedent is bad and ought to be shunned instead of imitated; and, in the
   second place, because there are no two cases perfectly alike in all their
   circumstances, and therefore the one cannot become a rule of decision for
   the other. It is justice and good judgment that preside by right in a
   court of arbitration. It is forms, quoted precedents, and contrivances for
   delay and expense to the parties, that govern the proceedings of a court
   of law.

   By establishing arbitrations in the room of courts of law for the
   adjustment of private cases, the public will be eased of a great part of
   the expence of the present judiciary establishment: for certainly such a
   host of judges, associate judges, presidents of circuits, clerks and
   criers of courts, as are at present supported at the public expence will
   not then be necessary. There are, perhaps, more of them than there are
   criminals to try in the space of a year. &mdash; Arbitration will 
   lessen the sphere of patronage, and it is not improbable
   that this was one of the private reasons for negativing the arbitration
   act; but public economy, and the convenience and ease of the individuals,
   ought to have outweighed all such considerations. The present
   Administration of the United States has struck off a long list of useless
   officers and economised the public expenditures, and it is better to make
   a precedent of this than to imitate its forms and long periods of
   election which require reform themselves.

   A great part of the people of Pennsylvania make a principle of not going
   to law, and others avoid it from prudential reasons; yet all those people
   are taxed to support a judiciary to which they never resort, which is as
   inconsistent and unjust as it is in England to make the Quakers pay tithes
   to support the Episcopal Church. Arbitration will put an end to this
   imposition.

   Another complaint against the constitution of Pennsylvania is the great
   quantity of patronage annexed to the office of governor.

   Patronage has a natural tendency to encrease the public expence by the
   temptation it leads to (unless in the hands of a wise man like Franklin)
   multiply offices within the gift or appointment of that patronage. John
   Adams, in his administration, went upon the plan of encreasing offices and
   officers. He expected by thus encreasing his patronage, and making
   numerous appointments, that he should attach a numerous train of adherents
   to him who would support his measures and his future election.
   He copied this from the corrupt system of England; and he closed his
   midnight labours by appointing sixteen new unnecessary judges, at an
   expence to the public of thirty-two thousand dollars annually. John counted only on one side
   of the case. He forgot that where there was *one* man to be benefited by an
   appointment, that all the rest had to pay the cost of it; and that by attaching
   *the one* to him by patronage, he run the risk of losing *the many* by
   disgust, and such was the consequence; and such will ever be the
   consequence in a free country, where men reason *for* themselves and *from*
   themselves, and not from the dictates of others.

   The less quantity of patronage a man is *incumbered* with, the safer he
   stands. He cannot please every body by the use of it; and he will have to
   refuse, and consequently to displease, a greater number than he can
   please. Mr. Jefferson gained more friends by dismissing a long train of
   officers, than John Adams did by appointing them. Like a wise man, Mr.
   Jefferson dismantled himself of patronage.

   The constitution of New York, tho' like all the rest it has its defects,
   arising from want of experience in the representative system of government
   at the time it was formed, has provided much better, in this case, than the
   constitution of Pennsylvania has done. The appointments in New York are made by a *council of appointment* 
   composed of the governor and a certain number of members of the senate
   taken from different parts of the state. By this means they have among
   them a personal knowledge of whomsoever they appoint. The governor has one
   vote but no negative. I do not hear complaints of the abuse of this kind
   of patronage.

   The constitution of Pennsylvania, instead of being an improvement in the
   representative system of government, is a departure from the principles of
   it. It is a copy in miniature of the government of England, established at
   the conquest of that country by William of Normandy. I have shewn this in
   part in the case of the king's negative, and I shall shew it more fully as
   I go on. This brings me to speak of the senate.

   The complaint respecting the senate is the length of its duration, being
   four years. The sage Franklin has said, "*Where annual election ends
   tyranny begins*:" and no man was a better judge of human nature than
   Franklin, nor has any man in our time exceeded him in the principles of
   honor and honesty.

   When a man ceases to be accountable to those who elected him, and with
   whose public affairs he is entrusted, he ceases to be their
   representative, and is put in a condition of being their despot. He
   becomes the representative of nobody but himself. "*I am elected, says he,
   for four years; you cannot turn me out, neither am I responsible to you in
   the mean time. All that you have to do with me is to pay me.*" &mdash; 
   The conduct of the Pennsylvania Senate in 1800, respecting the choice of
   electors for the presidency of the United States, shews the impropriety
   and danger of such an establishment. The manner of choosing electors ought
   to be fixed in the constitution, and not be left to the caprice of
   contention. It is a matter equally as important, and concerns the rights
   and interests of the people as much as the election of members for the
   state Legislature, and in some instances much more.
   By the conduct of the senate at that time the people were deprived of
   their right of suffrage, and the State lost its consequence in the union.
   It had but one vote. The other fourteen were paired off by
   compromise. Seven and seven. If the people had chosen the electors, which
   they had a right to do, for the electors were to represent *them* and not to
   represent the senate; the state would have had fifteen votes which would
   have counted.

   The senate is an imitation of what is called the house of lords in
   England, and which Chesterfield, who was a member of it, and therefore
   knew it, calls it "*the hospital of incurables*." The senate in Pennsylvania
   is not quite an hospital of incurables, but it took almost four years to
   bring it to a *state of convalescence*.

   Before we imitate any thing, we ought to examine whether it be worth
   imitating, and had this been done by the convention at that time, they
   would have seen that the model from which their mimic imitation was made,
   was no better than unprofitable and disgraceful lumber.

   There was no such thing in England as what is called the house of lords,
   until the conquest of that country by the Normans under William the
   conqueror, and like the king's negative over the laws, it is a badge of
   disgrace upon the country; for it is the effect and evidence of its having
   been reduced to unconditional submission.

   William having made the conquest, dispossessed the owners of their lands,
   and divided those lands among the chiefs of the plundering army he brought
   with him, and from hence arose what is called the *house of* LORDS. *Daniel
   de Foe*, in his historical satire, entitled, "*The true-born Englishman,*" has
   very concisely given the origin and character of this house, as follows:

   The great invading Norman let them know

   What conquerors, in after times, might do;

   To every musqueteer he brought to town,

   He gave the lands that never were his own &mdash; 

   He cantoned out the country to his men,

   And every soldier was a denizen;

   No parliament his army could disband,

   He raised no money, for he paid in land.

   The rascals, thus enriched, he called them *Lords*,

   To please their upstart pride with new made words

   And doome-day book his tyranny records;

   Some shew the sword, the bow, and some the spear,

   Which their great ancestor, forsooth, did wear;

   But who the hero was, no man can tell,

   Whether a colonel or a corporal;

   The silent record blushes to reveal

   Their undescended dark original;

   Great ancestors of yesterday, they shew,

   And Lords, whose fathers were &mdash; *the Lord knows who*!

   This is the disgraceful origin of what is called the house of lords in
   England, and it still retains some tokens of the plundering baseness of
   its origin. The swindler Dundas was lately made a lord, and is now
   called *noble lord!* Why do they not give him his proper title, and call him
   *noble* swindler! for he swindled by wholesale. But it is probable he will
   escape punishment; for Blackstone, in his commentary on the laws, recites
   an act of parliament passed in 1550, and not since repealed, that extends
   what is called the *benefit of clergy*, that is, exemption from punishment
   for all clerical offences to all lords and peers of the realm, who could
   not read, as well as those who could, and also for "the crimes of
   *house-breaking, highway-robbing, horse-stealing and robbing of churches.*
   This is consistent with the original establishment of the house of  lords,
   for it was originally composed of robbers. This is aristocracy. This is
   one of the pillars of John Adams's "*stupendous fabric of human invention.*"
   A privilege for house breaking, highway robbing, horse stealing and
   robbing of churches! John Adams knew but little of the origin and practice
   of the government of England. As to constitution it has none.

   The Pennsylvania convention of 1776 copied nothing from the English
   government. It formed a constitution on the basis of honesty. The defect,
   as I have already said of that constitution, was the precipitancy to which
   the legislatures might be subject in enacting laws. All the members of that
   legislature established by the constitution, sat in one chamber and
   debated in one body, and thus subjected them to precipitancy. But this
   precipitancy was provided against, but not effectually.
   The constitution ordered that the laws, before being finally enacted,
   should be published for public consideration. But as no given time was
   fixed for that consideration, nor any means for collecting its effect,
   nor were there then any public news papers in the state but what were
   printed in Philadelphia, the provision did not reach the intention of it,
   and thus a good and wise intention sank into mere form, which is generally
   the case when the means are not adequate to the end.

   The ground work, however, of that constitution was good, and deserves to
   be resorted to. &mdash; Every thing that Franklin was concerned in producing merits
   attention. He was the wise and benevolent friend of man. Riches and honors
   made no alternation in his principles or his manners.

   The constitution of '76 was conformable to the Declaration of
   Independence and the declaration of rights, which the present constitution
   is not; for it makes artificial distinctions among men in the right of
   suffrage, which the principles of equity know nothing of; neither is it
   consistent with sound policy. We every day see the rich becoming poor and
   those who were poor before becoming rich. Riches, therefore, having no
   stability, cannot and ought not to be made a criterion of rights. Man is
   man in every condition of life, and the varieties of fortune and
   misfortune are open to all.

   Had the number of representatives in the legislature, established by that
   constitution, been encreased, and instead of their sitting together in one
   chamber and debating and voting all at one time, to have divided by lot
   into two equal parts and sat in separate chambers, the advantage would
   have been, that one half by not being entangled in the first debate, nor
   having committed itself by voting, would be silently possessed of the
   arguments, for and against, of the former part and be in a calm condition
   to review the whole. And instead of one chamber, or one house, or by whatever name they may be
   called, negativing the vote of the other, which is now the case, and which
   admits of inconsistencies even to absurdities, to have added the votes of
   both chambers together, and the majority of the whole to be the final
   decision. There would be reason in this, but there is none in the present
   mode. The instance that occurred in the Pennsylvania senate in the year
   1800 on the bill for choosing electors, where a small majority in that
   house controuled and negatived a large majority in the other house, shews
   the absurdity of such a division of legislative power.

   To know if any theory or position be true or rational, in practice, the
   method is, to carry it to its greatest extent; if it be not true upon the
   whole, or be absurd, it is so in all its parts however small. For
   instance, 
   
   If one house consists of two hundred members and the other fifty, which is
   about the proportion they are in some of the states, and if a proposed law
   be carried on the affirmative in the larger house with only one dissenting
   voice, and be negatived in the smaller house by a majority of one, the event
   will be, that twenty-seven controul and govern two hundred and twenty-three, which is too absurd even for
   argument, and totally inconsistent with the principles of representative
   government, which know no difference in the value and importance of its
   members but what arises from their virtues and talents, and not at all
   from the name of the house or chamber they sit in.

   As the practice of a smaller number negativing a greater is not founded in
   reason we must look for its origin in some other cause.

   The Americans have copied it from England, and it was brought into England
   by the Norman conqueror, and is derived from the ancient French practice
   of voting by ORDERS, of which they counted three; *the clergy* (that is,
   Roman catholic clergy) the *noblesse* (those who had titles) and the *tiers
   etat*, or third estate,(3) which included all who were not of the two former
   orders, and which in England are called the *commons*, or *common people*, and
   the house in which they are represented is from thence called the *house of
   commons.*

   The case with the conqueror was, in order to complete and secure the
   conquest he had made, and hold the country in subjection, he cantoned it
   out among the chiefs of his army, to whom he gave castles and whom he
   dubbed with the title of *lords* as is before shewn. These being dependent
   on the conqueror, and having a united interest with him, became the
   defenders of his measures, and the guardians of his assumed prerogative
   against the people; and when the house called the *commons house of
   parliament* began by grants and charters from the conqueror and his
   successors, these lords claiming to be a distinct ORDER from the commons,
   though smaller in number, held a controuling, or negativing vote over them,
   and from hence arose the irrational practice of a smaller number
   negativing a greater.

   But what are these things to us, or why should we imitate them? We have
   but one ORDER in America, and that of the highest degree, the ORDER OF
   SOVEREIGNTY, and of this ORDER every citizen is a member of his own
   personal right. Why then have we descended to the base imitation of
   inferior things? By the event of the revolution we were put in a condition
   of thinking originally. The history of past ages shew scarcely any thing
   to us but instances of tyranny and antiquated absurdities. We have copied
   some of them and experienced the folly of them.

   Another subject of complaint in Pennsylvania is the judiciary, and this
   appears to require a thorough reform. Arbitration will of itself reform a
   great part, but much will remain to require amendment. 
   
   The courts of law still continue to go on, as to practice, in the same manner as when the
   state was a British colony. They have not yet arrived at the dignity of
   independence. They hobble along by the stilts and crutches of English and
   antiquated precedents. Their pleadings are made up of cases and reports
   from English law books; many of which are tyrannical, and all of them now
   foreign to us. Our courts require to be domesticated, for as they are at present
   conducted, they are a dishonor to the national sovereignty. Every case in
   America ought to be determined on its own merits, according to American
   laws, and all reference to foreign adjudications prohibited. The
   introduction of them into American courts serves only to waste time,
   embarrass causes, and perplex juries. This reform alone will reduce cases
   to a narrow compass easily understood.

   The terms used in courts of law, in sheriff's sales, and on several other
   occasions in writs, and other legal proceedings, require reform. Many of
   those terms are Latin, and others French. The Latin terms were brought
   into Britain by the Romans, who spoke Latin, and who continued in Britain
   between four and five hundred years, from the first invasion of it by Julius Caesar,
   fifty-two years before the christian era. The French terms were brought by
   the Normans when they conquered England in 1066, as I have before shewn,
   and whose language was French.

   These terms being still used in English law courts, shew the origin of
   those courts, and are evidence of the country having been under foreign
   jurisdiction. But they serve to *mystify*, by not being generally
   understood, and therefore they serve the purpose of what is called law,
   whose business is to perplex; and the courts in England put up with the
   disgrace of recording foreign jurisdiction and foreign conquest, for the
   sake of using terms which the clients and the public do not understand,
   and from thence to create the false belief that law is a learned science,
   and lawyers are learned men. The English pleaders, in order to keep up the farce of the profession,
   always compliment each other, though in contradiction, with the title of
   *my learned brother*. Two farmers or two merchants will settle cases by
   arbitration which lawyers cannot settle by law. Where then is the learning
   of the law, or what is it good for?

   It is here necessary to distinguish between *lawyer's law*, and *legislative
   law*. Legislative law is the law of the land enacted by our own
   legislators chosen by the people for that purpose. Lawyer's law is a mass
   of opinions and decisions, many of them contradictory to each other, which
   courts and lawyers have instituted themselves, and is chiefly made up of
   law-reports of cases taken from English law books. &mdash; The case of every man
   ought to be tried by the laws of his own country which he knows, and not
   by opinions and authorities from other countries, of which he may know
   nothing. A lawyer in pleading, will talk several hours about law, but it
   is *lawyer's* law, and not *legislative law*, that he means.

   The whole of the judiciary needs reform. It is very loosely appointed in
   most of the states, and also in the general government. The case, I
   suppose, has been, that the judiciary department in a constitution has
   been left to the lawyers, who might be in a convention, to form, and they
   have taken care to leave it loose. To say, that a judge shall hold his
   office during *good behaviour*, is saying nothing; for the term *good behaviour*, 
   has neither a legal nor a moral definition. In the common acceptation of the term it refers rather to a style of
   manners, than to principles, and may be applied to signify different and
   contradictory things. A child of good behaviour, a judge of good behaviour,
   a soldier of good behaviour in the field, and a dancing master of good
   behaviour in his school, cannot be the same good behaviour. What then
   is the good behaviour of a judge?

   Many circumstances in the conduct and character of a man may render him
   unfit to hold the office of a judge, yet not amount to cause of
   impeachment, which always supposes the commission of some known crime.
   Judges ought to be held to their duty by continual responsibility, instead
   of which the constitution releases them from all responsibility 
   except by impeachment, from which, by the loose, undefined establishment
   of the judiciary, there is always a hole to creep out. In annual elections
   for legislators, every legislator is responsible every year, and no good
   reason can be given why those entrusted with the execution of the laws
   should not be as responsible, at stated periods, as those entrusted with
   the power of enacting them.

   Releasing the judges from responsibility is in imitation of an act of the
   English parliament for rendering the judges so far independent of what is
   called the crown as not to be removable by it. The case is, that judges in
   England are appointed by the crown, and are paid out of the king's civil
   list, as being his representatives when sitting in court; and in all
   prosecutions for treason and criminal offences, the king is the prosecutor.
   It was therefore reasonable that the judge, before whom a man was to be
   tried, should not be dependent for the tenure of his office on the will of
   the prosecutor. But this is no reason that in a government founded on the
   representative system, a judge should not be responsible, and also
   removable by some constitutional mode, without the tedious and expensive
   formality of impeachment. We remove or turn out presidents, governors,
   senators and representatives without this formality. Why then are judges,
   who are generally lawyers, privileged with duration? It is, I suppose,
   because lawyers have had the formation of the judiciary part of the
   constitution.

   The term, "*contempt of court*," which has caused some agitation in
   Pennsylvania, is also copied from England; and in that country it means
   *contempt of the king's authority or prerogative in court*, because the
   judges appear there as his representatives, and are stiled in their
   commissions, when they open a court, "*his majesty the king's justices.*"

   This, now, undefined thing, called *contempt of court*, is derived from the
   Norman Conquest of England, as is shewn by the French form of words used in
   England, with which proclamation for silence "*on pain of imprisonment,*"
   begins, "*Oyez, Oyez, Oyez.*" (4) This shews it to be of Norman origin. It is, however, a
   species of despotism; for contempt of court is now anything a court
   imperiously pleases to call so and then it inflicts punishment as by
   prerogative without trial, as in Passmore's case, which has a good deal
   agitated the public mind. This practice requires to be constitutionally
   regulated, but not by lawyers.

   Much yet remains to be done in the improvement of constitutions. The
   Pennsylvania convention, when it meets, will be possessed of advantages
   which those that preceded it were not. The ensuing convention will have
   two constitutions before them; that of '76, and that of '90, each of
   which continued about fourteen years. I know no material objection against
   the Constitution of '76, except, that in practice, it might be subject to
   precipitancy; but this can be easily and effectually remedied as the
   annexed essay, respecting "*constitutions, governments and charters*" will
   shew. But there have been many and great objections and complaints against
   the present constitution and the practice upon it, arising from the
   improper and unequal distribution it makes of power.

   The circumstance that occurred in the Pennsylvania senate in the year
   1800, on the bill passed by the house of representatives for choosing
   electors, justifies Franklin's opinion, which he gave by request of the
   convention of '76, of which he was president, respecting the propriety or
   impropriety of two houses negativing each other. "*It appears to me,* said
   he, *like putting one horse before a cart and the other behind it, and
   whipping them both. If the horses are of equal strength, the wheels of the
   cart, like the wheels of government, will stand still; and if the horses
   are strong enough, the cart will be torn to pieces.*" It was only 
   the moderation of good sense of the country, which did not
   engage in the dispute raised by the senate, that prevented Pennsylvania
   from being torn to pieces by commotion.

   Inequality of rights has been the cause of all the disturbances,
   insurrections and civil wars that ever happened in any country, in any age
   of mankind. It was the cause of the American Revolution, when the English
   Parliament sat itself up *to bind America in all cases whatsoever*, and to
   reduce her to unconditional submission. It was the cause of the French
   Revolution, and also of the civil wars in England, in the time of Charles
   and Cromwell, when the house of commons voted the house of lords useless.

   The fundamental principle in representative government, is, that *the
   majority governs;* and as it will be always happening that a man may be in
   the minority on one question, and in the majority on another, he obeys by
   the same principle that he rules. But when there are two houses of unequal
   numbers, and the smaller number negativing the greater, it is the minority
   that governs which is contrary to the principle. This was the case in
   Pennsylvania in 1800.

   America has the high honor and happiness of being the first nation that
   gave to the world the example of forming written constitutions by
   conventions elected expressly for the purpose, and of improving them by
   the same procedure, as time and experience shall shew necessary.
   Government in other nations, vainly calling themselves civilized, has been
   established by bloodshed. &mdash; Not a drop of blood has been shed in the United
   States in consequence of establishing constitutions and governments by her
   own peaceful system. &mdash; The silent vote, or the simple *yea* or *nay*, is more
   powerful than the bayonet, and decides the strength of numbers without a
   blow.

   I have now, citizens of Pennsylvania, presented you in good will with a
   collection of thoughts and historical references condensed into a small
   compass that they may circulate the more conveniently. They are applicable
   to the subject before you, that of calling a convention, in the progress
   and completion of which I wish you success and happiness, and the honor of
   shewing a profitable example to the states around you and to the world.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Footnotes:

   1. Parliament is a French word, brought into England by the Normans. It comes from the
   French verb *parler* &mdash; to speak.

   2.  When a king of England (for they are not an English race of kings)
   negatives an act passed by the parliament, he does it in the Norman or
   French language, which was the language of the conquest the literal
   translation of which is, *the king will advise himself of it.* It is the
   only instance of a king of England speaking French in parliament; and
   shews the origin of the negative.
   
   3. The practice of voting by *orders* in France whenever the states general met, 
   continued until the late revolution. It
   was the present Abbe Sieves who made the motion, in what was afterwards
   called the national assembly, for abolishing the vote by *orders*, and
   established the rational practice of deciding by a majority of
   numbers.

   4. French for "hear ye, hear ye, hear ye."
