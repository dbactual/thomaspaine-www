   From the original letter at the TPNHA Collection at Iona College.

   N. Rochelle April 22, 1805

   Citizen

   I send this by the N. Rochelle boat and have desired the boat man to
   call on you with it. He is to bring up Bebee and Thomas and I will be
   obliged to you to see them safe on board. The boat will leave N. Y.
   on friday.

   I have left my pen-knife at Carver's. It is, I believe, in the writing
   desk - It is a small french penknife that slides into the handle. I wish
   Carver would look behind the Chest in the bed room. I miss some papers
   that I suppose are fallen down there. 
   
   The boys will bring up with them one
   pair of the blankets Mrs. Bonneville took down and also my best blanket
   which is at Carver's &mdash; I send enclosed three dollars for a ream of writing
   paper and one dollar for some letter paper and porterage to the boat - I
   wish you to give the boys some good advice when you go with them and tell
   them that the better they behave, the better it will be for them. I am now
   their only dependance and they ought to know it.

   Yours in friendship

   Thomas Paine

   All my No. of the prospect while I was at Carver's are left there.
   The boys can bring them. I have received no No. since I came to N. Rochelle.
