   To John Fellows  April 22, 1805

   NEW ROCHELLE,

   CITIZEN :

   I send this by the N[ew] Rochelle boat and have desired the boatman to
   call on you with it. He is to bring up Bebia and Thomas and I will be
   obliged to you to see them safe on board. The boat will leave N[ew] Y[ork]
   on Friday.

   I have left my pen knife at Carver's. It is, I believe, in the writing
   desk. It is a small French pen knife that slides into the handle. I wish
   Carver would look behind the chest in the bed room. I miss some papers
   that I suppose are fallen down there. The boys will bring up with them one
   pair of the blankets Mrs. Bonneville took down and also my best blanket
   which is at Carver's. I send enclosed three dollars for a ream of writing
   paper and one dollar for some letter paper, and porterage to the boat. I
   wish you to give the boys some good advice when you go with them, and tell
   them that the better they behave the better it will be for them. I am now
   their only dependence, and they ought to know it.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   All my Numbers of the Prospect, while I was at Carver's, are left there.
   The boys can bring them. I have received no No. since I came to New
   Rochelle.
