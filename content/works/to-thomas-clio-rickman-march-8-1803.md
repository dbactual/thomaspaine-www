   To Thomas Clio Rickman March 8, 1803

   NEW YORK,

   MY DEAR FRIEND:

   Mr. Monroe, who is appointed Minister Extraordinary to France, takes
   charge of this, to be delivered to Mr. Este, banker, in Paris, to be
   forwarded to you.

   I arrived at Baltimore on the 30th October, and you can have no idea of
   the agitation which my arrival occasioned. From New Hampshire to Georgia
   (an extent of 1500 miles), every newspaper was filled with applause or
   abuse.

   My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and is
   now worth six thousand pounds sterling; which put in the funds will bring
   me -L-400 sterling a year.

   Remember me in friendship and affection to your wife and family, and in
   the circle of our friends.

   I am but just arrived here, and the minister sails in a few hours, so that
   I have just time to write you this. If he should not sail this tide I will
   write my good friend Col. Bosville, but in any case I request you to wait
   on him for me.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.
