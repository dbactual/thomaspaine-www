   From the original letter at the New York Public Library.
   
   Paris March 6th 1795

   My Dear Friend

   Mr. Mozard who is appointed Consul will present you this letter. He is
   spoken of here as a good sort of man and I can have no doubt that you
   will find him the same at Boston. When I came from America it was my
   intention to return the next year, and I have intended the same every year
   since, the case I believe is, that as I am imbarked in the revolution I
   do not like to leave it till it is finished notwithstanding the dangers I
   have run - I am now almost the only survivor of those who began this
   revolution, and I know not how it is that I have escaped. I know however
   that I owe nothing to the government of America. The executive department
   has never directed either the former or the present minister to enquire
   whether I was dead or alive, in prison or in liberty, what the cause of
   the imprisonment was and whether there was any service or assistance it
   could render. Mr. Monroe acted voluntarily in the case and reclaimed me
   as an American Citizen, for the pretence for my imprisonment was that I
   was a foreigner, born in England &mdash; The internal scene here, from 
   the 31 of May 1793 to the fall of Robespierre has been terrible. I was 
   shut up in the prison of the Luxembourg eleven months, and I find by 
   the papers of Robespierre
   that have been published by the Convention since his death that I was
   designed for a worse fate. The following mem. is in his own
   hand writing - "Demander que Thomas Paine soit decrete d'accusation pour les
   interets de l'Amerique autant que de la France."

   You will see by the public Papers that the successes of the french arms
   have been, and continue to be astonishing, more especially since the fall
   of Robespierre, and the suppression of the system of Terror. They have
   fairly beaten all the armies of Austria, Prussia, England, Spain, Sardinia
   and Holland. Holland is entirely conquered and there is now a revolution
   in that Country &mdash; 

   I know not how matters are going on your side the water but I think
   every thing is not as it ought to be. The appointment of G. Morris to be
   Minister here was the most unfortunate and the most injudicious
   appointment that could be made. I wrote this opinion to Mr. Jefferson at
   the time, and I said the same to Morris. Had he not been removed at the
   time he was I think the two countries would have been involved in a
   Quarrel, for it is a fact, that he would either have been ordered away or
   put in arrestation, for he gave every reason to suspect that he was
   secretly a British Emissary.

   What Mr. Jay is about in England I know not; but is it possible that any
   man who has contributed to the independence of America and to free her
   from the tyranny of the British Govt can read without shame and
   indignation the note of Jay to Grenville &mdash; That *the United States has no
   other resource than in the justice and magnanimity of his Majesty*, is a
   satire upon the Declaration of Independence, and exhibits a spirit
   of meanness on the part of America, that were it true I should be
   ashamed of her. Such a declaration may suit the spaniel Character of
   Aristocracy, but it cannot agree with the manly character of a Republican.

   Mr. Mozard is this moment come for this letter, and he sets off directly &mdash; 
   God bless you, remember me among the circle of our friends, and tell them
   how much I wish to be once more among them.

   THOMAS PAINE
   
   Governor Adams Boston
