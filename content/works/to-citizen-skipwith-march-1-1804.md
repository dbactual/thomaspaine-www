   From the original letter at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

   Dear friend
   
   I have just a moment to write you a line by a friend who is on the point
   of sailing for Bordeaux. The republican interest in now completely
   triumphant. The change within this last year has been great. We have now
   14 states out of 17 - N Hampshire, Mass, and Connecticut
   stand out. I much question if any person will be started against Mr.
   Jefferson. Burr is rejected for the vice presidency; he is now putting up
   for Governor of N York. Mr. Clinton will be run for
   vice-president. Morgan Lewis, chief Justice of the state of N. Y. 
   is the republican candidate for Governor of that state.

   I have not received a line from Paris, except a letter from Este, since I
   left it. We have now been nearly 80 days without news from Europe. What is
   Barlow about? I have not heard any thing from him except that he is
   always coming. What is Bonneville about? Not a line has been received from
   him.

   Yours in friendship

   Thomas Paine
