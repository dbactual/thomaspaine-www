   To The Royal Academy of Sciences  July 21, 1787

   PARIS,

   [Gentlemen:]

   I have the honor to present to you the model for the construction of an
   American bridge. This bridge made of iron bars forming a single arch, is
   to be built over the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania, where piles cannot
   be used.

   The high opinion which the government of Pennsylvania, at whose head is my
   highly respected friend, Doctor Franklin, holds of the Royal Academy of
   Sciences has made him desire to have your opinion on the construction of
   this bridge before attempting to put it into execution, and the friendship
   which exists today between the two nations as well as your skill in
   rendering judgments which enlighten the whole scientific world, has led
   him to hope, gentlemen, that you would gratify his wishes and favor him
   with the judgment which he has the honor to ask of you. I enclose herewith
   the report of the Committee appointed by the Government of Pennsylvania, a
   literal transcript from its records.

   THOMAS PAINE.
