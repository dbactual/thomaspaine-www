   TO THE EDITOR.
   
   As the good sense of the people in their elections have now put the affairs 
   of the union in a prosperous condition at home, and abroad, there is nothing 
   immediately important for the subject of a letter, I therefore send you a piece on another subject.
   
   THOMASPAINE, TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.

   IN casting my eye over England and America, and comparing them together,
   the difference is very striking. The two countries were created by the
   same power and peopled from the same stock, what then has caused the
   difference? Have those who emigrated to America improved, or those whom
   they left behind degenerated? There are as many degrees of difference in
   the political morality of the two people, as there are of longitude between
   the two countries.

   In the science of cause and effect, every thing that enters into the
   composition of either must be allowed its proportion of influence.
   Investigating, therefore, into the cause of this difference we must take
   into the calculation the difference of the two systems of government the
   *hereditary* and the *representative*. Under the hereditary system it is the government that forms and fashions
   the political character of the people: In the representative system it is
   the people that form the character of the government. &mdash; Their own happiness
   as citizens forms the basis of their conduct and the guide of their
   choice. Now, is it more probable that a hereditary government should
   become corrupt, and corrupt the people by its example, or that a whole
   people should become corrupt and produce a corrupt government; for the
   point where the corruption begins becomes the source from whence it
   afterwards spreads.

   While men remained in Europe as subjects of some hereditary potentate, they
   had ideas conformable to that condition; but when they arrived in America
   they found themselves in possession of a new character, the character of
   sovereignty; and like converts to a new religion, they became inspired 
   with new principles. Elevated above their former
   rank, they considered government and public affairs as part of their own
   concern, for they were to pay the expence, and they watched them with
   circumspection. They soon found that government was not that complicated thing, enshrined
   in mystery, which church and state, to play into each other's hands, had
   represented it; and that to conduct it with proper effect was to conduct it
   justly. Common sense, common honesty, and civil manners qualify a man for
   government; and besides this, put man in a situation that requires new
   thinking, and the mind will grow up to it, for, like the body, it improves
   by exercise. Man is but a learner all his lifetime.

   But whatever be the cause of the difference of character between the
   people and government of England and those of America, the effect arising
   from that difference is as distinguishable as the sun from the moon. We
   see America flourishing in peace, cultivating friendship with all nations,
   and reducing her public debt and taxes, incurred by the revolution. On the
   contrary we see England almost perpetually in war, or warlike disputes,
   and her debt and taxes continually encreasing. Could we suppose a stranger, 
   who knew nothing of the origin of the two
   countries, he would from observation, conclude, that America was the *old*
   country experienced and sage, and England the *new*, eccentric and wild.

   Scarcely had England drawn home her troops from America after the
   revolutionary war, than she was on the point of plunging herself into a
   war with Holland on account of the stadtholder; then with Russia; then
   with Spain on the account of Nootka *cat-skins*, and actually with France to
   prevent her revolution. Scarcely had she made peace with France, and
   before she had fulfillled her own part of the treaty, then she declared
   war again to avoid fulfillling the treaty. In her treaty of peace with America, she engaged to evacuate the western
   posts within six months, but having obtained peace she refused to fulfil
   the conditions and kept possession of the posts and embroiled us in an
   Indian war. In her treaty of peace with France she engaged to evacuate
   Malta within three months, but having obtained peace she refused to
   evacuate Malta and began a new war.

   All these matters pass before the eyes of the world, who form their own
   opinion thereon, regardless of what England news-papers may say of France
   or French papers say of England. The non-fulfilment of a treaty is a
   case that every body can understand. They reason upon it as they would on a
   contract between two individuals, and in so doing they reason from a right
   foundation. The affected pomp and mystification of courts make no
   alteration in the principle. Had France declared war to compel England to fulfil the treaty, as a man
   would commence a civil action to compel a delinquent party to fulfil a
   contract, she would have stood acquitted in the opinion of nations. But
   that England still holding Malta, should go to war for Malta, is a paradox
   not easily solved, unless it be supposed that the peace was insidious from
   the beginning, that it was concluded with the expectation that the
   military ardour of France would cool, or a new order of things arise, or a
   national discontent prevail, that would favour a non-execution of the
   treaty and leave England arbiter of the fate of Malta.

   Something like this, which was like a vision in the clouds, must have been
   the calculation of the British ministry; for certainly they did not expect
   the war would take the turn it has. Could they have foreseen and they
   ought to have foreseen that a declaration of war was the same as sending
   a challenge to Bonaparte to invade England and make it the seat of war,
   they hardly would have done it unless they were mad; for in any event such
   a war might produce, in a military view, it is England would be the
   sufferer unless it terminated in a wise revolution. &mdash; One of the 
   causes assigned for this declaration of war by the British
   ministry, was, that Bonaparte had cramped their commerce. &mdash; If by cramping
   their commerce is to be understood that of encouraging and extending the
   commerce of France, he had a right, and it was his duty to do it. The
   prerogative of monopoly belongs to no nation. But to make this one of the
   causes of war, considering their commerce in consequence of that
   declaration is now cramped ten times more, is like the case of a foolish
   man who after losing an eye in fighting renews the combat to revenge the
   injury and loses the other eye.

   Those who never experienced an invasion by suffering it, which the
   English people have not, can have but little idea of it. Between the two
   armies the country will be desolated, wherever the armies are, and that as
   much by their own army as by the enemy. &mdash; The farmers on the coast will be
   the first sufferers, for whether their stock of cattle, corn, &c. be
   seized by the invading army, or driven off, or burnt, by orders of their
   own government the effect will be the same to them. As to the revenue, 
   which has been collected altogether in paper, since the
   bank stopt payment, it will go to destruction the instant an invading
   army lands? and as to effective government, there can be but little where
   the two armies are contending for victory in a country small as England
   is.

   With respect to the general politics of Europe, the British ministry could
   not have committed a greater error than to make Malta the ostensible cause
   of the war; for though Malta is an unproductive rock, and will be an
   expence to any nation that possesses it, there is not a power in Europe
   will consent that England should have it. It is a situation capable of
   annoying and controlling the commerce of other nations in the
   Mediterranean; and the conduct of England on the seas, and in the Baltic,
   has shown the danger of her possessing Malta. Bonaparte, by opposing her
   claim, has all Europe with him. &mdash; England by asserting it loses all. 
   Had the English Ministry studied for an object that would put them at
   variance with all nations, from the north of Europe to the south, they
   could not have done it more effectually.

   But what is Malta to the people of England compared with the evils and
   dangers they already suffer in consequence of it. It is their own
   government that has brought this upon them. Were Burke now living he
   would be deprived of his exclamation that "*the age of chivalry is gone*;"
   for this declaration of war is like a challenge sent from one knight of
   the sword to another knight of the sword to fight him on the challenger's
   ground, and England is staked as the prize.

   But though the British ministry began this war for the sake of Malta, they
   are now artful enough to keep Malta out of sight. Not a word is now said
   about Malta in any of their parliamentary speeches and messages. The
   king's speech is silent upon the subject, and the invasion is put in its
   place, as if the invasion was the cause of the war and not the consequence
   of it. This policy is easily seen through. The case is, they went to war
   *without counting the cost* or calculating upon events, and they are now
   obliged to shift the scenes to conceal the disgrace.

   If they were disposed to try experiments upon France, they chose for it
   the worst possible time, as well as the worst possible object. France has
   now for its chief the most enterprising and fortunate man, either for deep
   project or daring execution, the world has known for many ages. Compared
   with him, there is not a man in the British government, or under its
   authority, has any chance with him. That he is ambitious the world knows,
   and he always was so; but he knew where to stop. He had reached the 
   highest point of probable expectation, and having
   reduced all his enemies to peace, had set himself down to the improvement
   of agriculture, manufactures & commerce at home; and his conversation
   with the English ambassador Whitworth shewed he wished to continue so.
   In this view of his situation, could any thing be worse policy than to give
   to satisfied ambition a new object and provoke it into action. Yet this
   the British ministry have done.

   The plan, of a descent upon England by gun-boats, began after the first
   peace with Austria and the acquisition of Belgium by France. Before that
   acquisition, France had no territory on the north sea, and it is there the
   descent will be carried on. Dunkirk was then her northern limit. The 
   English coast opposite to France on the Channel, from the straits
   between Dover and Calais to the land's end, about three hundred miles, is
   high, bold, and rocky, to the height, in many places perpendicular, of
   three, four or five hundred feet, and it is only where there are breaks in
   the rocks as at Portsmouth, Plymouth, &c. that a landing can be made,
   and as those places could be easily protected, because England was
   mistress of the channel, France had no opportunity of making an invasion
   unless she could first defeat the English fleet. But the union of Belgium
   to France makes a new order of things.

   The English coast on the north sea, including the counties of Essex,
   Suffolk, Norfolk and Lincolnshire is as level as a bowling green, and
   approachable in every part for more than two hundred miles. The shore is a
   clean firm sand, where a flat-bottomed boat may row dry aground. The
   country people use it as a race ground & for other sports when the tide
   is out. It is the weak and defenceless part of England, and it is
   impossible to make it otherwise; and besides this, there is not a port or
   harbour in it where ships of the line or large frigates can rendezvous for
   its protection. The Belgic coast and that of Holland which joins it, is directly
   opposite this defenseless part, and opens a new passage for invasion. The
   Dutch fishermen know this coast better than the English themselves, except
   those who live upon it; and the Dutch smugglers know every creek and
   corner in it.

   The original plan, formed in the time of the directory (but now much more
   extensive) was to build one thousand boats, each sixty feet long, sixteen feet
   broad, to draw about two feet water, to carry a twenty-four or thirty-six pounder in the
   head and a field piece in the stern to be run out as soon as they
   touched ground. Each boat was to carry an hundred men, making in the whole
   one hundred thousand, and to row with twenty or twenty-five oars on a
   side. Bonaparte was appointed to the command, and by an agreement between
   him and me, I was to accompany him, as the intention of the expedition was
   to give the people of England an opportunity of forming a government for
   themselves and thereby bring about peace. I have no reason to suppose this part of the plan is altered, because
   there is nothing better Bonaparte can do. As to the clamour spread by some
   of the English news-papers that he comes for plunder, it is absurd.
   Bonaparte is too good a general to undiscipline and dissolute his army by
   plundering, and too good a politicia, as well as too much accustomed to
   great achievements, to make plunder his object. He goes against the
   government that has declared war against him.

   As the expedition could choose its time of setting off either after a
   storm, when the English would be blown off, or in a calm, or in a fog; and
   as thirty six hours rowing would be able to carry it over, the
   probability is it would arrive, and when arrived no ship of the line or
   large frigate could approach it, on account of the shoalness of the coast;
   and besides this the boats would form a floating battery close in with
   the shore of a thousand pieces of heavy artillery; and the attempt of
   Nelson against the gun-boats at Boulogne shows the insufficiency of ships
   in such situations &mdash; About two hundred and fifty gun-boats were built when
   the expedition was abandoned for that of Egypt, to which the preparations
   had served as a feint.

   The present impolitic war by the English government has now renewed the
   plan, and that with much greater energy than before, and with national
   unanimity. All France is alive to chastise the English government for
   recommencing the war, and all Europe stands still to behold it. The
   preparations for the invasion have already demonstrated to France, what
   England ought never to have suffered her to know, which is, that she can
   hold the English government in terror and the whole country in alarm
   whenever she pleases, and as long as she pleases, and that without
   employing a single ship of the line, and more effectually than if she had
   an hundred sail. The boasted navy of England is out-done by gun-boats! It
   is a revolution in naval tactics. But we live in an age of revolutions.

   The preparations in England for defence are also great, but they are
   marked with an ominous trait of character. There is something sullen on
   the face of affairs in England. Not an address had been presented to the
   king by any county, city, town, or corporation since the declaration of
   war. &mdash; The people unite for the protection of themselves and property
   against whatever events may happen, but they are *not pleased* and their
   silence is the expression of their discontent.

   Another circumstance, curious and awkward, was the conduct of the house of
   commons with respect to their address to the king in consequence of the
   king's speech at the opening of the parliament. The address which is
   always an echo of the speech, was voted without opposition, and this
   equivocal silence passed for unanimity. The next thing was to present it,
   and it was made the order for the next day that the house should go up in
   a body to the king with the speaker at their head for that purpose. The 
   time fixed was half after three, and it was expected the procession
   would be numerous, three or four hundred at least, in order to shew their
   zeal and their loyalty and their thanks to the king for his intention of
   taking the field. But when half after three arrived, only thirty members
   were present, and, without forty (the number that makes a house) the
   address could not be presented. The sergeant was then sent out, with the
   authority of a press warrant, to search for members, and by four o'clock
   he returned with just enough to make up forty and the procession set off
   with the slowness of a funeral, for it was remarked it went slower than
   usual.

   Such a circumstance in such a critical juncture of affairs, and on such an
   occasion, shews at least a great indifference toward the government. It
   was like saying, you have brought us into a great deal of trouble, and we
   have no *personal* thanks to make to you. We have voted the address as a
   customary matter of form and we leave it to find its way to you as well
   as it can.

   If the invasion succeed, I hope Bonaparte will remember that this war has
   not been provoked by the people. It is altogether the act of the
   government without their consent or knowledge; and though the late peace
   appears to have been insidious from the first on the part of the
   government, it was received by the people with a sincerity of joy.

   There is yet perhaps one way, if it be not too late, to put an end to
   this burthensome state of things, and which threatens to be worse; which
   is for the people, now they are embodied for their own protection, to
   instruct their representatives in Parliament to move for the fulfilment
   of the treaty of Amiens, for a treaty ought to be fulfiled. The present
   is an uncommon case accompanied with uncommon circumstances, and it must
   be got over by means suited to the occasion. What is Malta to them? The possession of it might serve to extend the
   patronage and influence of the crown on the appointment to new offices,
   and the part that would fall to the people would be to pay the expence.
   The more acquisitions the Government makes abroad, the more taxes the
   people have to pay at home. This has always been the case in England.

   The non-fulfilment of a treaty ruins the honor of a government, and
   spreads a reproach over the character of a nation. But when a treaty of
   peace is made with the concealed design of not fulfilling it, and war is
   declared for avowed purpose of avoiding it, the case is still worse. The
   representative system does not put it in the power of an individual to
   declare war of his own will. It must be the act of the body of the
   representatives, for it is their constituents who are to pay the expence.
   The state which the people of England are now in, shews the extreme danger
   of trusting this power to the caprice of an individual, whatever title he
   may bear. In that country this power is assumed by what is called, the
   crown, for it is not constituted by any legal authority. It is a branch
   from the trunk of monarchical despotism.

   By this impolitic declaration of war, the government of England have put
   every thing to issue; and no wise general would commence an action he might
   avoid, where nothing is to be gained by gaining a battle, and every thing
   is to be lost by losing it. An invasion and a revolution, which
   consequently includes that of Ireland, stand now on the same ground. &mdash; What
   part the people may finally take in a contest pregnant with such an issue
   is yet to be known. By the experiment of raising the country *in mass* the government have put
   arms into the hands of men whom they would have sent to Botany Bay but a
   few months before, had they found a pike in their possession. The honor of
   this project, which is copied from France, is claimed by Mr. Pitt; and no
   project of his has yet succeeded in the end, except that of raising the
   taxes and ruining the bank. All his schemes in the revolutionary war of
   France failed of success and finished in discredit. If Bonaparte is 
   remarkable for an unexampled series of good fortune, Mr.
   Pitt is remarkable for a contrary fate: and his want of popularity with
   the people, whom he deserted and betrayed on the question of a reform of
   parliament, sheds no beams of glory round his projects.

   If the present eventful crisis, for an eventful one it is, should end in a
   revolution, the people of England have, within their glance, the benefit
   of experience both in theory and fact. This was not the case at first. The
   American revolution began on untried ground. The representative system of
   government was then unknown in practice, and but little thought of in
   theory. The idea that man must be governed by effigy and show, and that
   superstitious reverence was necessary to establish authority, had so
   benumbed the reasoning faculties of man, that some bold exertion was
   necessary to shock them into reflection. But the experiment has now been
   made. &mdash; The practice of almost thirty years, the last twenty of which have
   been of peace, notwithstanding the wrong headed tumultuous administration
   of John Adams, has proved the excellence of the representative system, and
   the NEW WORLD is now the preceptor of the old. The children are become the
   fathers of their progenitors.

   With respect to the French revolution, it was begun by good men and on
   good principles, and I have always believed it would have gone on so had
   not the provocative interference of foreign powers, of which Pitt was the
   principal and vindictive agent, distracted it into madness and sown
   jealousies among the leaders.

   The people of England have now two revolutions before them. The one as an
   example; the other as a warning. Their own wisdom will direct them what to
   chuse and what to avoid, and in every thing which regards their happiness,
   combined with the common good of mankind, I wish them honor and success.
