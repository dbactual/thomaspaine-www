   To Thomas Jefferson April 10, 1789

   LONDON,

   DEAR SIR:

   Mr. Parker and Rumsey having set off for Paris prevented me the
   opportunity of sending you the former part. Your favor of March 17th came
   safe to hand for which I am obliged to you. The King continues in his
   amended state, but Dr. Willis, his son, and attendants are yet about his
   person. He has not been to Parliament, nor made any public appearance, but
   he has fixed April 23 for a public thanksgiving, and he is to go in great
   parade to offer up his devotions at St. Paul's on that day. Those about
   him have endeavored to dissuade him from this ostentatious pilgrimage,
   most probably from an apprehension of some effect it may have upon him,
   but he persists. The treaty with Prussia has been laid before Parliament
   but nothing has been said upon it. The acts for regulating the trade with
   America are to be continued as last year. A paper from the Privy Council
   respecting the American fly is before Parliament. I had some conversations
   with Sir Joseph Banks upon this subject, as he was the person whom the
   Privy Council referred to. I told him that the Hessian fly attacked only
   the green plants, and did not exist in dry grain. He said that with
   respect to the Hessian fly, they had no apprehension, but it was the
   weevil they alluded to. I told him the weevil had always more or less been
   in the wheat countries of America, and that if the prohibition was on that
   account it was as necessary fifty or sixty years ago as now; that I
   believe it was only a political maneuver of the ministry to please the
   landed interest, as a balance for prohibiting the exportation of wool, to
   please the manufacturing interest. He did not reply, and as we are on very
   sociable terms I went farther by saying--The English ought not to complain
   of the non-payment of debts from America while they prohibit the means of
   payment.

   I suggest to you a thought on this subject. The debts due before the war,
   ought to be distinguished from the debts contracted since, and all and
   every mode of payment and remittance under which they have been discharged
   at the time they were contracted ought to accompany those debts, so long
   as any of them shall continue unpaid; because the circumstances of payment
   became united with the debt, and cannot be separated by subsequent acts of
   one side only. If this was taken up in America and insisted on as a right
   co-eval with and inseparable from those debts, it would force some of the
   restrictions here to give way.

   You speak very truly of this country when you say "that they are
   slumbering-under a half reformation of politics and religion, and can- not
   be excited by anything they hear or see to question the remains of
   prejudice." Their ignorance on some matters, is unfathomable, for instance
   the Bank of England discounts bills at 5 per cent, but a proposal is
   talked of for discounting at 4%; and the reason given is the vast quantity
   of money, and that money of the good houses discounts at 4%; from this
   they deduce the great ability and credit of the nation. Whereas the
   contrary is the case. The money is all in paper, and the quantity is
   greater than the object to circulate it upon, and therefore shows that the
   market is glutted, and consequently the ability for farther paper
   exertions is lessened. If a war should ever break out between the
   countries again, this is the spot where it ought to be prosecuted. They
   neither feel nor care for anything at a distance, but are frightened and
   spiritless at everything which happens at home. The combined fleet coming
   up the Channel, Paul Jones, and the Mob of 1738, are the dreadful eras of
   this country. But for national puffing none equals them. The addresses
   which have been presented are stuffed with nonsense of this kind. One of
   them published in the London Gazette and presented by a Sir William
   Appleby begins thus,-"Britain, the Queen of Isles, the pride of Nations,
   the Arbitress of Europe, perhaps of the world."

   The exceeding bad weather has delayed my return to the Iron Works, as a
   new experiment especially needs all the advantages of fine weather. Next
   Monday or Tuesday I set off and leave this in the care of Mr. Mason, who
   is returning to Paris on his way to Bordeaux. On the receipt of your last
   I went to Sir Joseph to inform him of your having heard from Ledyard, from
   Grand Cairo, but found he had a letter from him of the same date. Sir
   Joseph is one of the society for promoting that undertaking. He has an
   high opinion of Ledyard, and thinks him the only man fitted for such an
   exploration. As you may probably hear of Ledyard by accounts that may not
   reach here, Sir Joseph will be obliged to you to communicate to him any
   matters respecting him that may come to you (Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., Soho
   Square).

   The rumors respecting a negotiation for the Austrian Netherlands are at a
   stand, and the English papers have sent the Prince of Nassau to Madrid to
   push forward the Quadruple Alliance, to which Denmark is to accede.

   The Slave Trade is to come in the 27th of April. Mr. Wilberforce has given
   notice that he shall move for a total abolition of the traffic. It will
   pass the Commons, and probably stop in [the] House of Peers.

   While writing this I am informed that the Minister has had a conference
   with some of the American creditors, and proposed to them to assume the
   debts and give them ten shillings on the pound-the conjecture is that he
   means, when the new Congress is established, to demand the payment. If you
   are writing to General Washington, it may not be amiss to mention this-and
   if I hear farther on the matter I will inform you. But, as being a money
   matter it cannot come forward but through Parliament, there will be notice
   given of the business. This would be a proper time to show that the
   British Acts since the Peace militate against the payment by narrowing the
   means by which those debts might have been paid when they were contracted,
   and which ought to be considered as constituent parts of the contract.
   April 13. The New York Packet arrived on Friday-brought nothing new. It
   started the 4th March on which day the new Congress met. Mr. Rumsey came
   yesterday (Sunday). I set off this evening for my Iron Works.

   THOMAS PAINE.
