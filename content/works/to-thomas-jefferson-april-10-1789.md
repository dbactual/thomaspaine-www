   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.
   
   April 10th

   Msrs. Parker and Rumsey having set off for Paris prevented me the
   opportunity of sending you the former part &mdash; Your favor of 
   March 17th. came safe to hand for which I am obliged to you. The King 
   of England continues in his amended State &mdash; but Dr. Willis, 
   his son and attendants are yet about his person &mdash; He has 
   not been to Parliament nor made any public appearance &mdash; but
   he has fixed April 23d for a public thanksgiving, and he is to go in great
   parade to offer up his Devotions at St. Pauls on that day &mdash; Those about
   him have endeavoured to dissuade him from this ostentatious pilgrimage,
   most probably from an apprehension of some effect it may have upon 
   him &mdash; but he persists &mdash; The treaty with Prussia has been 
   laid before parliament but nothing has been said upon it &mdash; 
   The Acts for regulating the Trade with America are to be continued as 
   last year &mdash; A Paper from the Privy Council
   respecting the American fly is before Parliament. I had some conversations
   with Sir Joseph Banks upon this subject as he was the person whom the
   privy Council referred to &mdash; I told him that the Hessian 
   fly attacked only the green plant, and did not exist in dry grain &mdash; 
   He said that with respect to the Hessian fly, they had no apprehension 
   &mdash; but it was the weevil they alluded to &mdash; I told him the weevil 
   had always, more or less, been in the wheat Countries of America &mdash; 
   and that if the prohibition was on that
   account it was as necessary fifty or sixty years ago as now &mdash; that I
   believed it was only a political manoeuver of the Ministry to please the
   landed interest &mdash; as a balance for prohibiting the exportation of 
   Wool, to please the manufacturing interest &mdash; He did not reply &mdash; 
   and as we are on very sociable terms I went farther by saying &mdash; 
   the English ought not to complain of the non-payment of Debts from 
   America while they prohibit the means of payment.

   I suggest to you a thought on this Subject &mdash; the Debts due 
   before the war ought to be distinguished from the Debts contracted 
   since, and all and every mode of payment and remittance under which they 
   *might have been discharged at the time they were contracted* ought to 
   accompany those Debts, so long as any of them shall continue unpaid 
   &mdash; because the Circumstances of payment
   became united with the Debt, and cannot be separated by subsequent Acts of
   one side only &mdash; If this was taken up in America and insisted 
   on as a right co-eval with and inseparable from those Debts &mdash; 
   it would force some of the restrictions here to give way &mdash;

   You speak very truly of this Country when you say "that they are
   slumbering under a half reformation of Politics and religion, and cannot
   be excited by any thing they hear or see to question the remains of
   prejudice." &mdash; Their ignorance on some matters is unfathomable &mdash; 
   for instance, the Bank of England discount Bills at 5 p cent &mdash; but 
   a proposal is
   talked of for discounting at 4 1/2 and the reason given is the *vast quantity
   of money* and that money of the good houses discount at 4 1/2 &mdash; from 
   this they deduce the great ability and credit of the nation whereas the
   contrary is the case &mdash; This money is all in paper, and the quantity is
   greater than the object to circulate it upon, and therefore shews that the
   market is glutted and consequently the ability for farther paper
   exertions is lessened. If a War should ever break out between the
   Countries again &mdash; this is the spot where it ought to be prosecuted 
   &mdash; they neither feel nor Care for any thing at a distance but are 
   frightened and spiritless at every thing which happens at home. The combined 
   fleet coming up the Channel Paul Jones, &mdash; and the Mob of 1738 are the 
   dreadful eras of this Country &mdash; but for national puffery none equals 
   them &mdash; The addresses
   which have been presented are stuffed with nonsense of this kind &mdash;  
   One of them published in the London Gazette and presented by a Sir William
   Appleby begins thus &mdash; "Britain, the queen of Isles, the pride of 
   Nations, the Arbitress of Europe, perhaps, of the world." &mdash;

   The exceeding bad weather has delayed my return to the Iron Works, as a
   new experiment especially ought to have all the advantages of fine weather 
   &mdash; next Monday or Tuesday I sett off and leave this in the Care of 
   Mr. Mason, who is returning to Paris on his way to Bordeaux. &mdash; 
   On the receipt of your last I went to Sir Joseph Banks to inform him 
   of your having heard from Ledyard from Grand Cairo &mdash; but found he 
   had a letter from him of the same date. &mdash; Sir
   Joseph is one of the Society for promoting that undertaking, he has an
   high opinion of Ledyard, and thinks him the only man fitted for such an
   exploration &mdash; As you may probably hear of Ledyard by accounts that 
   may not reach here, Sir Joseph will be obliged to you to communicate to him 
   any matters respecting him that may arrive to you (Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., 
   Soho Square) &mdash;

   The Rumours respecting a negociation for the Austrian Netherlands are at a
   Stand &mdash; and the English Papers have sent the Prince of Nassau to 
   Madrid to push forward the Quadruple Alliance, to which Denmark is to accede 
   &mdash; 

   The Slave Trade is to come in the 27th of April &mdash; Mr. Wilberforce 
   has given notice that he shall move for a total abolition of the traffic 
   &mdash; It will pass the Commons, and probably stop in house of Peers &mdash; 

   While writing this I am informed that the Minister has had a Conference
   with some of the American Creditors and proposed to them to assume the
   Debts and give them ten shillings on the pound &mdash; the conjecture is 
   that he means when the new Congress is established to demand the payment 
   &mdash; If you are writing to General Washington it may not be amiss to 
   mention this &mdash; and if I hear farther on the matter I will inform you 
   &mdash; But as being a money
   matter it cannot come forward but through Parliament there will be notice
   given of the business &mdash; This would be a proper time to shew that the
   British Acts since the Peace militate against the payment by narrowing the
   means by which those debts might have been paid when they were contracted
   and which ought to be considered as constituent parts of the contract &mdash; 
   
   April 13 &mdash; The New York Packet arrived on Fryday &mdash; brought 
   nothing new &mdash; it sailed the 4th March on which day the New Congress 
   met &mdash; Mr. Rumsey came yesterday (Sunday) &mdash; and I set off this 
   evening for my Iron Works.
   
   your affectionate friend & Ob. Humble Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
