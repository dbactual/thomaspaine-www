   To his Excellency George Washington  November 30, 1781

   opposite the Quaker Meeting House,

   SECOND STREET,

   SIR:

   As soon as I can suppose you to be a little at leisure from business and
   visits, I shall, with much pleasure, wait on you, to pay you my respects
   and congratulate you on the success you have most deservedly been blest
   with.

   I hope nothing in the perusal of this letter will add a care to the many
   that employ your mind; but as there is a satisfaction in speaking where
   one can be conceived and understood, I divulge to you the secret of my own
   situation; because I would wish to tell it to somebody, and as I do not
   want to make it public, I may not have a fairer opportunity.

   It is seven years, this day, since I arrived in America, and though I
   consider them as the most honorary time of my life, they have nevertheless
   been the most inconvenient and even distressing. From an anxiety to
   support, as far as laid in my power, the reputation of the Cause of
   America, as well as the Cause itself, I declined the customary profits
   which authors are entitled to, and I have always continued to do so; yet I
   never thought (if I thought at all on the matter), but that as I dealt
   generously and honorably by America, she would deal the same by me. But I
   have experienced the contrary-and it gives me much concern, not only on
   account of the inconvenience it has occasioned to me, but because it
   unpleasantly lessens my opinion of the character of a country which once
   appeared so fair, and it hurts my mind to see her so cold and inattentive
   to matters which affect her reputation.

   Almost everybody knows, not only in this country but in Europe, that I
   have been of service to her, and as far as the interest of the heart could
   carry a man I have shared with her in the worst of her fortunes, yet so
   confined have been my private circumstances that for one summer I was
   obliged to hire myself as a common clerk to Owen Biddle of this city for
   my support: but this and many others of the like nature I have always
   endeavored to conceal, because to expose them would only serve to entail
   on her the reproach of being ungrateful, and might start an ill opinion of
   her honor and generosity in other countries, especially as there are pens
   enough abroad to spread and aggravate it.

   Unfortunately for me, I knew the situation of Silas Deane when no other
   person knew it, and with an honesty, for which I ought to have been
   thanked, endeavored to prevent his fraud taking place. He has himself
   proved my opinion right, and the warmest of his advocates now very
   candidly acknowledge their deception.

   While it was everybody's fate to suffer I cheerfully suffered with them,
   but though the object of the country is now nearly established and her
   circumstances rising into prosperity, I feel myself left in a very
   unpleasant situation. Yet I am totally at a loss what to attribute it to;
   for wherever I go I find respect, and everybody I meet treats me with
   friendship; all join in censuring the neglect and throwing blame on each
   other, so that their civility disarms me as much as their conduct
   distresses me. But in this situation I cannot go on, and as I have no
   inclination to differ with the country or to tell the story of her
   neglect, it is my design to get to Europe, either to France or Holland. I
   have literary fame, and I am sure I cannot experience worse fortune than I
   have here. Besides a person who understood the affairs of America, and was
   capable and disposed to do her a kindness, might render her considerable
   service in Europe, where her situation is but imperfectly understood and
   much misrepresented by the publications which have appeared on that side
   the water, and though she has not behaved to me with any proportionate
   return of friendship, my wish for her prosperity is no ways abated, and I
   shall be very happy to see her character as fair as her cause.

   Yet after all there is something peculiarly hard that the country which
   ought to have been to me a home has scarcely afforded me an asylum.

   In thus speaking to your Excellency, I know I disclose myself to one who
   can sympathize with me, for I have often cast a thought at your difficult
   situation to smooth over the unpleasantness of my own.

   I have begun some remarks on the Abbe Raynal's History of the Revolution.
   In several places he is mistaken, and in others injudicious and sometimes
   cynical. I believe I shall publish it in America, but my principal view is
   to republish it in Europe both in French and English.

   Please, Sir, to make my respectful compliments to your Lady, and accept to
   yourself the best wishes of, Your obedient humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
