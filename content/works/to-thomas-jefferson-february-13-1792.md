  From the original letter at the Library of Congress.
  
  London Feby. 13 1792
  
  Dear Sir

  Mr. Kenedy who brings this to N York, is on the point of setting out. I am 
  therefore confined to time: I have enclosed six copies of my work for 
  yourself in a parcel addressed to the President, and three or four for my 
  other friends, which I wish you take the trouble of presenting.
  
  I have just heard of Gouverneur Morris's appointment. *It is a most unfortunate 
  one*, and as I shall mention the same thing to him when I see him, I do not 
  express it to you with the injunction of Confidence &mdash; He is just now 
  arrived in London, and this circumstance has served, as I see by the french 
  papers, to encrease the dislike and suspicion of some of that nation and the
  National Assembly against him - 
  
  Your affectionate friend &c
  
  THOMAS PAINE
  
  Mr. Jefferson Secreatary of State
  
  P.S. In the present state of Europe it would be best to make no appointments
