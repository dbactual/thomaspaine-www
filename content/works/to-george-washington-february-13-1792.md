   To George Washington  February 13, 1792

   PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

   LONDON,

   SIR:

   An opportunity immediately offering, I have had a dozen copies of my new
   work put up for the purpose (the work being not yet published), to present
   to you and Mr. Jefferson. I hope the fifty copies of my former work, which
   were sent to Portsmouth (England), to the care of Mr. Greene, have come
   safe to your hands.

   Wishing you every happiness, I remain, Your much obliged obedient Humble
   servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
