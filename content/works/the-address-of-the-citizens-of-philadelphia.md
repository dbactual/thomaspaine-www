   AND OF THE LIBERTIES

   THEREOF-TO HIS EXCELLENCY, THE PRESIDENT, AND CONGRESS

   OF THE UNITED STATES

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Written by Paine in July, 1783, this memorial urged the national
   legislature to return to Philadelphia. Congress had left the city in June,
   after having been threatened by a mutiny of Pennsylvania troops who were
   discontented over the failure to receive any pay for their military
   services. The memorial was published in the Pennsylvania Gazette of August
   6, 1783.

   ********************

   Most Honorable Sirs

   From the Commencement of the late ever memorable contest for liberty and
   the honor and happiness of the human race, the Citizens of Philadelphia,
   and of the Liberties thereof, have in an especial manner distinguished
   themselves by every exertion which principle could inspire or fortitude
   support.

   Neither have they been free with their lives only as Militia but with
   their fortunes as Citizens. As instances of these we need only appeal to
   facts.

   The Progress of the War has fully confirmed the one and the monthly return
   of taxes from this State of which the City and Liberties form so great a
   part has not been exceeded by any and we wish they had been proportionally
   equaled by every State in the Union. To which we may add the establishment
   of the bank which has extended its usefulness to the public service, and
   acquired a permanency as effectual and in some instances superior to those
   of other nations.

   The government of this State has, likewise, ever distinguished itself by
   adopting and passing and the Citizens by supporting all such laws
   recommended by Congress as were necessary to be passed throughout the
   Continent for bringing the War to a happy issue and for raising such
   monies as the expence of it required.

   The Act for laying a duty of five Per Cent upon imported Articles though
   it would have found its richest mine in the Commerce and consumption of
   this City and State, yet struck with the propriety and equity of raising
   money from the Channel in which it most circulates and impressed with the
   Necessity as well as the bounden duty of maintaining the justice and honor
   of America we cheerfully gave it our best support. And as we have ever
   been so we mean ever to continue to be among the foremost to establish the
   National Character of America as the firm basis of inviolable faith and
   sacred honor.

   In thus expressing our minds to Congress we are likewise compelled to say,
   That from your residence among us We have been Witnesses to the uncommon
   difficulties you have had to struggle with. We have beheld them with
   concern and often times with heartfelt anxiety. We have participated in
   Your Cares and partook of your burdens.

   While our chiefest consolation under them was that they did not arise from
   any unwillingness or backwardness in the Government of this State to adopt
   the proper measures for removing them or from any narrow views in the
   Citizens to counteract them-

   We do not amuse the World with calling on Congress to do Justice to the
   army and to the creditors of America and yet withhold the means by which
   that Justice is to be fulfilled. On the contrary we freely offer ourselves
   to bear our share in any National measure to effect those purposes and to
   establish the character of America equal to her Rank.

   We are now most solemnly to assure your Excellency and Congress that
   though we do not enter into the reasons or causes which might suggest to
   your Honorable Body the propriety of adjourning at the particular time you
   did adjourn from your long accustomed Residence in this City, Yet as a
   Testimony of the Affections of the Citizens to that Union which has so
   happily succeeded in accomplishing the freedom and independence of
   America, We beg leave to assure Congress that if either now or at any
   future time until the Residence of Congress shall be permanently
   established it should appear to your Honorable Body that the situation of
   Philadelphia is convenient for transacting therein the concerns of the
   Nation that Congress may Repose the utmost confidence in its inhabitants,
   not only to prevent any Circumstance which may have a tendency to disturb
   their necessary deliberations but to aid in all measures to support the
   national honor and dignity.
