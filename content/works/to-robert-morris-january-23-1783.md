   To Robert Morris  January 23, 1783

   PROVIDENCE,

   SIR:

   This makes my fourth letter without receiving a line from you in answer to
   my first letter from Mr. Lots which disappointment will put me to a good
   deal of difficulty.

   Enclosed is my last piece, and as I find the Commissioners are not coming
   forward I begin to have thoughts of returning, otherwise I should have
   waited to accompany them back.

   There is one idea which occurs very strongly to me, which will finally
   show the extreme ill-policy of Rhode Island. The fisheries, in all
   probability will be the last and most difficult point to settle in a
   negotiation, and yet this foolish state which has so great a dependence on
   them is creating a necessity for closing with the best terms of peace that
   can be first obtained.

   I find that the persons who are at the head of the opposition in this
   town, are endeavoring to prevent the publication of any more of my pieces.
   They set out with claiming the privilege and freedom of the press and now
   want to suppress it. Compliments to Mr. G[ouverneur] M[ orris].

   I am Sir, your obedient Humble Servant,

   T. PAINE.
