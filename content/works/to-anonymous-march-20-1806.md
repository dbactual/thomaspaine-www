   NEW ROCHELLE,

   SIR:

   I will inform you of what I know respecting General Miranda, with whom I
   first became acquainted at New York, about the year 1783. He is a man of
   talents and enterprise, and the whole of his life has been a life of
   adventures.

   I went to Europe from New York in April, 1787. Mr. Jefferson was then
   Minister from America to France, and Mr. Littlepage, a Virginian (whom Mr.
   Jay knows), was agent for the king of Poland, at Paris. Mr. Littlepage was
   a young man of extraordinary talents, and I first met with him at Mr.
   Jefferson's house at dinner. By his intimacy with the king of Poland, to
   whom also he was chamberlain, he became well acquainted with the plans and
   projects of the Northern Powers of Europe. He told me of Miranda's getting
   himself introduced to the Empress Catharine of Russia, and obtaining a sum
   of money from her, four thousand pounds sterling; but it did not appear to
   me what the object was for which the money was given; it appeared a kind
   of retaining fee.

   After I had published the first part of the Rights of Man in England, in
   the year 1791, I met Miranda at the house of Turnbull and Forbes,
   merchants, Devonshire Square, London. He had been a little before this in
   the employ of Mr. Pitt, with respect to the affair of Nootka Sound, but I
   did not at that time know it; and I will, in the course of this letter,
   inform you how this connection between Pitt and Miranda ended; for I know
   it of my own knowledge.

   I published the second part of the Rights of Man in London, in February,
   1792, and I continued in London till I was elected a member of the French
   Convention, in September of that year; and went from London to Paris to
   take my seat in the Convention, which was to meet the 20th of that month.
   I arrived in Paris on the 19th. After the Convention met, Miranda came to
   Paris, and was appointed general of the French army, under General
   Dumouriez. But as the affairs of that army went wrong in the beginning of
   the year 1793, Miranda was suspected, and was brought under arrest to
   Paris to take his trial. He summoned me to appear to his character, and
   also a Mr. Thomas Christie, connected with the house of Turnbull and
   Forbes. I gave my testimony as I believed, which was, that his leading
   object was and had been the emancipation of his country, Mexico, from the
   bondage of Spain; for I did not at that time know of his engagements with
   Pitt. Mr. Christie's evidence went to show that Miranda did not come to
   France as a necessitous adventurer; but believed he came from
   public-spirited motives, and that he had a large sum of money in the hands
   of Turnbull and Forbes. The house of Turnbull and Forbes was then in a
   contract to supply Paris with flour. Miranda was acquitted.

   A few days after his acquittal he came to see me, and in a few days
   afterwards I returned his visit. He seemed desirous of satisfying me that
   he was independent, and that he had money in the hands of Turnbull and
   Forbes. He did not tell me of his affair with old Catharine of Russia, nor
   did I tell him that I knew of it. But he entered into conversation with
   respect to Nootka Sound, and put into my hands several letters of Mr.
   Pitt's to him on that subject; amongst which was one which I believe he
   gave me by mistake, for when I had opened it, and was beginning to read
   it, he put forth his hand and said, "O, that is not the letter I
   intended"; but as the letter was short I soon got through with it, and
   then returned it to him without making any remarks upon it. The dispute
   with Spain was then compromised; and Pitt compromised with Miranda for his
   services by giving him twelve hundred pounds sterling, for this was the
   contents of the letter.

   Now if it be true that Miranda brought with him a credit upon certain
   persons in New York for sixty thousand pounds sterling, it is not
   difficult to suppose from what quarter the money came; for the opening of
   any proposals between Pitt and Miranda was already made by the affair of
   Nootka Sound. Miranda was in Paris when Mr. Monroe arrived there as
   Minister; and as Miranda wanted to get acquainted with him, I cautioned
   Mr. Monroe against him, and told him of the affair of Nootka Sound, and
   the twelve hundred pounds.

   You are at liberty to make what use you please of this letter, and with my
   name to it.

   THOMAS PAINE.
