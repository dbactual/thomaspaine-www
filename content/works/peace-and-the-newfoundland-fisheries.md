   Philip Foner's introduction:

   In 1779, when peace between England and the United States was being
   proposed, the English insisted that the United States surrender her
   fishing rights to the Newfoundland banks. A writer in the Pennsylvania
   Gazette under the name of "Americanus," supposed to be Gouverneur Morris,
   upheld the British contention and suggested that in the negotiations with
   the British, the Americans should not insist on the right to the
   fisheries. He also argued that the United States could not logically
   expect France to prolong the war for this insignificant point. Paine
   opposed the idea in three letters to the Pennsylvania Gazette, insisting
   that our fishing right was "a natural right." Rather than being an
   insignificant issue, he contended that without the fisheries America would
   not really be independent. "Without the fisheries, American independence
   would be a bubble," he wrote, and added: "There are but two natural
   sources of wealth and strength-the Earth and the Ocean -and to lose the
   right of either is, in our situation, to put up the other to sale."
   Especially interesting for today is his observation that "the seeds of
   almost every former war have been sown in the injudicious or defective
   terms of the preceding peace."

   MESSRS. HALL AND SELLERS



   GENTLEMEN: A piece of very extraordinary complexion made its appearance in
   your last paper, under the signature of AMERICANUS, and what is equally as
   extraordinary, I have not yet met with one advocate in its favor. To write
   under the curse of universal reprobation is hard indeed, and proves that
   either the writer is too honest for the world he lives in, or the world,
   bad as it is, too honest for him to write in.

   Some time last winter a worthy member of the Assembly of this State put
   into my hands, with some expressions of surprise, a motion which he had
   copied from an original shown to him by another member, who intended to
   move it in the House. The purport of that, and the doctrine of AMERICANUS,
   bear such strong resemblance to each other that I make no hesitation in
   believing them both generated from the same parents. The intended motion,
   however, withered without being put, and AMERICANUS, by venturing into
   being, has exposed himself to a less tranquil exit.

   Whether AMERICANUS sits in Congress or not, may be the subject of future
   inquiry; at present I shall content myself with making some strictures on
   what he advances.

   He takes it for granted that hints toward a negotiation for peace have
   been made to Congress, and that a debate has taken place in that House
   respecting the terms on which such a negotiation shall be opened.

   It is reported, says he, that Congress are still debating what the terms
   shall be, and that some men strenuously insist on such as others fear will
   not be agreed to, and as they apprehend may prevent any treaty at all, and
   such as our ally [France], by his treaties with us, is by no means bound
   to support us in demanding.

   After running through a variety of introductory matter, AMERICANUS, comes
   at last to the point, and intimates, or rather informs, that the
   particular subject of debate in Congress has been respecting the fisheries
   on the Banks of Newfoundland, some insisting thereon as a matter of right
   and urging it as a matter of absolute necessity, others doubting, or
   appearing to doubt whether we have any right at all, and indifferent
   whether the fisheries be claimed or not. Among the latter of which
   AMERICANUS appears to be one.

   Either AMERICANUS does not know how to make a bargain, or he has already
   made one, and his affectation of modesty is the dress of design. How, I
   ask, can AMERICANUS, or any other person, know what claims or proposals
   will be rejected or what agreed to, till they be made, offered or
   demanded? To suppose a rejection is to invite it, and to publish our
   "apprehensions," as a reason for declining the claim, is encouraging the
   enemy to fulfill the prediction. AMERICANUS may think what he pleases, but
   for my own part, I hate a prophesier of ill-luck, because the pride of
   being thought wise often carries him to the wrong side.

   That an inhabitant of America or a member of Congress should become an
   advocate for the exclusive right of Britain to the fisheries, and signify,
   as his opinion, that an American has not a right to fish in the American
   seas, is something very extraordinary.

   It is a question, says he, whether the subjects of these states had any
   other right to fishing than what they derived from their being subjects of
   Great Britain; and as it cannot be pretended that they were in the
   possession and enjoyment of the right either at the time of the
   Declaration of Independence or of signing the Treaties of Paris, nor that
   it was ever included in any one of the charters of the United States, it
   cannot be surprising that many, who judge a peace necessary for the
   happiness of these states, should be afraid of the consequences which may
   follow from making this an ultimatum in a negotiation.

   I should be glad to know what ideas AMERICANUS affixes to the words peace
   and independence; they frequently occur in his publication, but he uses
   them in such a neutral manner, that they have neither energy nor
   signification. Peace, it is true, has a pleasant sound, but he has nibbled
   it round, like Dr. Franklin's description of a gingerbread cake, till
   scarcely enough is left to guess at the composition. To be at peace
   certainly implies something more than barely a cessation of war. It is
   supposed to be accompanied with advantages adequate to the toils of
   obtaining it. It is a state of prosperity as well as safety, and of honor
   as well as rest. His independence, too, is made up of the same letters
   which compose the independence of other nations, but it has something so
   sickly and so consumptive in its constitution, so limping and lingering in
   its manner, that at best it is but in leading strings, and fit rather for
   the cradle than the cabinet. But to return to his argument:

   AMERICANUS has placed all his reasons the wrong way, and drawn the
   contrary conclusions to what he ought to have done. He doubts the rights
   of the States to fish, because it is not mentioned in any of the charters.
   Whereas, had it been mentioned, it might have been contended that the
   right in America was only derivative; and been given as an argument that
   the original right lay in Britain. Therefore the silence of the charters,
   added to the undisturbed practice of fishing, admit the right to exist in
   America naturally, and not by grant, and in Britain only consequentially;
   for Britain did not possess the fisheries independent of America, but in
   consequence of her dominions in America. Her claiming territory here was
   her title deed to the fisheries, in the same manner that Spain claims
   Faulkland's Island, by possessing the Spanish continent; and therefore her
   right to those fisheries was derived through America, and not the right of
   America through Britain. Wedded to the continent, she inherited its
   fortunes of islands and fisheries, but divorced therefrom, she ceases her
   pretensions.

   What AMERICANUS means by saying, that it cannot be pretended we were in
   the possession and enjoyment of the right either at the time of the
   Declaration of Independence, or of signing the Treaty of Paris, I am at a
   loss to conceive; for the right being natural in America, and not
   derivative, could never cease, and though by the events of war she was at
   that time dispossessed of the immediate enjoyment, she could not be
   dispossessed of the right, and needed no other proofs of her title than
   custom and situation.

   AMERICANUS has quoted the second and eleventh articles of the Treaty of
   Paris, by way of showing that the right to the fisheries is not one of
   those rights which France has undertaken to guarantee.

   To which I answer, that he may say the same by any particular right,
   because those articles describe no particular rights, but are
   comprehensive of every right which appertains to sovereignty, of which
   fishing in the American seas must to us be one.

   Will AMERICANUS undertake to persuade that it is not the interest of
   France to endeavor to secure to her ally a branch of trade which redounds
   to the mutual interest of both, and without which the alliance will lose
   half its worth? Were we to propose to surrender the right and practice of
   fishing to Britain, we might reasonably conclude that France would object
   to such a surrender on our part, because it would not only render us a
   less valuable ally in point of commerce as well as power, but furnish the
   enemy of both with a new acquisition of naval strength; the sure and
   natural consequence of possessing the fisheries.

   AMERICANUS admits the fisheries to be an "object of great consequence to
   the United States, to two or three of them more especially."

   Whatever is of consequence to any, is so to all; for wealth like water
   soon spreads over the surface, let the place of entrance be ever so
   remote; and in like manner, any portion of strength which is lost or
   gained to any one or more states, is lost or gained to the whole; but this
   is more particularly true of naval strength, because, when on the seas it
   acts immediately for the benefit of all, and the ease with which it
   transports itself takes in the whole coast of America, as expeditiously as
   the land forces of any particular state can be arranged for its own
   immediate defense.

   But of all the States of America, New York ought to be the most anxious to
   secure the fisheries as a nursery for a navy;-because the particular
   situation of that State, on account of its deep waters, is such, that it
   will ever be exposed to the approaches of an enemy, unless it be defended
   by a navy; and if any of the delegates of that State has acted a contrary
   part, he or they have either designedly or ignorantly betrayed the
   interest of their constituents, and deserve their severest censure.

   Through the whole of this curious and equivocal piece, the premises and
   arguments have, in themselves, a suspicious appearance of being unfairly
   if not unjustly stated, in order to admit of, and countenance, wrong
   conclusions; for taking it for granted that Congress have been debating
   upwards of four months what the terms shall be on which they shall open a
   negotiation, and that the House are divided respecting their opinion of
   those terms, it does not follow from thence that the "public have been
   deceived" with regard to the news said to have arrived last February; and
   if they are deceived, the question is who deceived them? Neither do
   several other conclusions follow which he has attempted to draw, of which
   the two I shall now quote are sufficient instances.

   If, says AMERICANUS, the insisting on terms which neither the Declaration
   of Independence nor the Treaties of Paris authorized us to challenge as
   our rights, have caused the late, otherwise unaccountable delays, and
   prevented a peace, or at least a negotiation being open for one, those who
   have challenged and insisted on these claims are justly responsible for
   the consequences.

   This I look on to be truly Jesuitical; for the delay cannot be occasioned
   by those who propose, but by those who oppose, and therefore the
   construction should stand thus:

   If the objecting to rights and claims, which are neither inconsistent with
   the Declaration of Independence or the Treaties of Paris, and naturally
   included and understood in both, has caused the late, otherwise
   unaccountable delays, and prevented a peace, or at least a negotiation for
   one, those who made such objections, and thereby caused such delays and
   prevented such negotiations being gone into, are justly responsible for
   the consequences.

   His next position is of the same cast, and admits of the same reversion.

   Governor Johnstone, says he, in the House of Commons freely declared he
   had made use, while in America, of other means to effect the purpose of
   his commission than those of reason and argument; have we not, continues
   AMERICANUS, good right from present appearances to believe that in this
   instance he declared the truth?

   To this wonderful supposition I shall apply another, viz. That if Governor
   Johnstone did declare the truth, whom have we most right to suspect, those
   who are for relinquishing the fisheries to Britain, or those who are for
   retaining them?

   Upon the whole, I consider the fisheries of the utmost importance to
   America, and her natural right thereto so clear and evident, that it does
   not admit of a debate, and to surrender them is a species of treason for
   which no punishment is too severe.

   I have not stepped out of my way to fetch in either an argument or a fact,
   but have confined my reply to the piece, without regard to who the author
   is, or whether any such debates have taken place or not, or how far it may
   or [may] not have been carried on one side or the other.

   COMMON SENSE.

   June 26, 1779.

   PHILADELPHIA,

   (SECOND LETTER - The second letter appeared in the Pennsylvania Gazette of
   July 14, 1779.-Editor)

   AMERICANUS, in your last, has favored the public with a description of
   himself as a preface to his piece. "I am," says he, "neither a member of
   Congress or of the Assembly of this State, or of any other, but a private
   citizen, in moderate circumstances in point of fortune, and whose
   political principles have never been questioned." All this may be very
   true, and yet nothing to the purpose; neither can the declaration be
   admitted either as a positive or negative proof of what his principles
   are. They may be good, or they may not, and yet be so well known as not to
   be doubted by those who know the writer.

   Joseph Galloway formerly wrote under the signature of AMERICANUS, and
   though every honest man condemns his principles, yet nobody pretends to
   question them. When a writer, and especially an anonymous one, readily
   means to declare his political principles as a reinforcement to his
   arguments, he ought to be full, clear, and decisive, but this declaration
   is so ambiguously constructed and so unmeaningly applied, that it may be
   used by any and every person either within or without the enemy's lines,
   for it does not declare what his principles are, but that, be they what
   they may, they are not questioned.

   Before I proceed, I cannot help taking notice of another inconsistency in
   his publication of last week. "In my last," says he, "I said that it was
   very unhappy that this question has been touched on or agitated at all at
   this time, to which," continues he, "I will now add, it is particularly
   so, that it is become a subject of discussion in the public papers." This
   is very extraordinary from the very man who first brought it into the
   public papers.

   A short piece or two, on the importance of fisheries in general, were
   anonymously published some time ago; but as a matter of treaty debate in
   Congress, or as a matter of right in itself, with the arguments and
   grounds on which they proceeded, AMERICANUS is originally chargeable with
   the inconvenience he pretends to lament. I with some others had heard, or
   perhaps knew, that such a subject was in debate, and though I always laid
   myself out to give it a meeting in the papers whenever it should appear, I
   never hinted a thought that might tend to start it.

   "To permit the public," says AMERICANUS, "to be made acquainted with what
   are to be the ultimate demands in a proposed treaty is really something
   new and extraordinary, if not impolitic and absurd." There is a compound
   of folly and arrogance in this declaration, which deserves to be severely
   censured. Had he said that to publish all the arguments of Congress, on
   which any claim in a proposed treaty is founded or objected to, might be
   inconvenient and in some cases impolitic, he would have been nearly right;
   but the ultimate demand itself ought to be made known, together with the
   rights and reasons on which that demand is founded.

   But who is this gentleman who undertakes to say that to permit the public
   to be made acquainted is really impolitic and absurd? And to this question
   I will add that if he distinguishes Congress into one body, and the public
   into another, I should be glad to know in what situation he places
   himself, so as not to be subject to his own charge of absurdity. If he
   belongs to the former, he has, according to his own position, a right to
   know but not to tell, and if to the latter, he has neither a right to know
   nor to tell, and yet in some character or other he has done both. If this
   gentleman's political principles were never questioned before, I think
   they ought to be questioned now; for a man must be a strange character
   indeed, whom no known character can suit.

   I am the more inclined to suspect AMERICANUS, because he most illiberally,
   and in contradiction to everything sensible and reasonable, endeavored, in
   his former piece, to insinuate that Governor Johnstone had bribed a party
   in Congress to insist on the right of the United States to fish on the
   Banks of Newfoundland. An insinuation so impolitic and absurd, so wide and
   foreign to the purpose of Governor Johnstone's commission, can only be
   understood the contrary way; namely, that he had bribed somebody or other
   to insist that the right should not be insisted on.

   The expression of Governor Johnstone, as printed in the English papers, is
   literally this. "I do not," says he, "mean to disavow I have had
   transactions, where other means have been used besides persuasion."
   Governor Johnstone was in no places in America but Philadelphia and New
   York, and these other means must have been used in one or other, or both
   of these places. We have had evidence of one application of his, with an
   offer of ten thousand guineas, which was refused, and treated with the
   disdain it deserved; for the offer of a bribe contains in it, to all men
   of spirit, the substance of an affront. But it is strange indeed, if the
   one that was refused was the only one that was offered. Let any person
   read AMERICANUS in your paper of June twenty-third, and if he can after
   that acquit him of all suspicion, he must be charitable indeed.

   But why does not AMERICANUS declare who he is? This is no time for
   concealment, neither are the presses, though free, to become the vehicles
   of disguised poison. I have had my eye on that signature these two months
   past, and to what lengths the gentleman meant to go himself can best
   decide.

   In his first piece he loosely introduced his intended politics, and put
   himself in a situation to make further advances. His second was a rapid
   progress, and his last a retreat. The difference between the second and
   last is visible. In the former of those two he endeavors to invalidate the
   right of the United States to fish on the Banks of Newfoundland, because,
   forsooth, it was not mentioned in any of the former charters. It is very
   extraordinary that these same charters, which marked out and were the
   instruments of our dependence, should now be introduced as describing the
   line of our independence.

   In the same piece AMERICANUS likewise says, "it is a question whether the
   subjects of these states had any other right to that fishery, than what
   they derived from being the subjects of Great Britain." If this be not
   advocating the cause of the enemy, I know not what is. It is newspaper
   advice to them to insist on an exclusive right to the fisheries, by
   insinuating ours to be only a derivative one from them; which, had it been
   the case, as it is not, would have been very improper doctrine to preach
   at the first instance of a negotiation. If they have any right, let them
   find those rights out themselves. We shall have enough to do to look to
   our own side of the question, and ought not to admit persons among us to
   join force with the enemy either in arms or argument.

   Whether AMERICANUS found himself approaching a stormy latitude, and
   fearing for the safety of his bark, thought proper to tack about in time,
   or whether he has changed his appetite, and become an epicure in fish, or
   his principles, and become an advocate for America, must be left for his
   own decision; but in his last week's publication he has surrendered the
   grounds of his former one, and changed the argument from a matter of right
   to a matter of supposed convenience only. He no more speaks of our right
   to the fisheries as derivative right from Britain, in consequence of our
   formerly being subjects. Not a syllable of the charters, whose silence he
   had produced as invalidating or negativing our independent right. Neither
   has he endeavored to support, or offered to renew, what he had before
   asserted-namely, that we were not in possession of the right of fishing at
   the time of the Declaration of Independence, or of the signing the
   Treaties of Paris; but he has admitted a theorem which I had advanced in
   opposition to his suggestions, and which no man can contradict, viz. that
   our right to fish on banks of Newfoundland is a natural right.

   Now if our right is natural, it could not be derived from subjection, and
   as we never can but by our own voluntary consent be put out of the
   possession of a natural national right, though by the temporary events of
   war we may be put out of the enjoyment of such a right, and as the British
   Fishery Act of Parliament in Seventy-six to exclude us was no act of ours,
   and universally denied by us, therefore, from his own admission, he has
   contradicted himself, and allowed that we were as fully in possession of
   the right of fishing on those banks, both at the time of the Declaration
   of Independence, and at the time of signing the Treaties of Paris, as at
   any period preceding them.

   That he has admitted the natural right in his last piece, in contradiction
   to his supposed derivative right in his former one, will appear from two
   or three quotations I shall make.

   1st. He says, The giving up of our right to this object (the fisheries)
   and the making an express demand to have it guaranteed to us, or the
   passing it over in silence in negotiation, are distinct things.

   2d. I am well assured, he says, that there is not a member in Congress any
   ways disposed to give up or relinquish our right to the Newfoundland
   fishery.

   The "right" here admitted cannot be a right derived from subjection,
   because we are no longer British subjects; neither can it be a right
   conveyed by charters, because we not only know no charters now, but those
   charters we used to know are silent on the matter in question. It must
   therefore be a natural right. Neither does the situation of America and
   Britain admit of any other explanation, because they are, with respect to
   each other, in a state of nature, not being even within the law of
   nations; for the law of nations is the law of treaties, compounded with
   customary usage, and between America and Britain there is yet no treaty,
   nor any national custom established.

   But the third quotation I shall make from his last piece will prove, from
   his own words, his assent to the natural right which I contended for in
   behalf of these states, and which he, in his former piece, impliedly
   disowned, by putting our whole right on a question, and making our former
   subjection the grounds on which that question stood.

   I drew no conclusion, he says, to exclude these states, or bar them from
   the right which by nature they are entitled to with others, as well to the
   fishery on the Banks of Newfoundland as to those in the ocean at large.

   As he now admits a natural right, and appears to contend for it, I ask,
   why then was his former piece published, and why was our right there put
   in the lowest terms possible? He does not in that piece even hint, or
   appear to think of, or suppose such a thing as a natural right, but stakes
   the issue on a question which does not apply to the case, and went as far
   as a man dared to go, in saying we had no right at all. From all this
   twisting and turning, this advancing and retreating, and appearing to own
   at last what it impliedly disowned at first, I think myself justified in
   drawing this conclusion, that either AMERICANUS does not know how-to
   conduct an argument, or he intended to be a traitor if he dared.

   The natural right of the United States in those fisheries is either whole
   or in part. If to the whole, she can admit a participation to other
   nations. If to a part, she, in consequence of her natural right to
   partake, claims her share therein, which is for as much as she can catch
   and carry away. Nature, in her distribution of favors, seems to have
   appointed these fisheries as a property to the northern division of
   America, from Florida upwards, and therefore our claim of an exclusive
   right seems to be rationally and consistently founded; but our natural
   right to what we can catch is clear, absolute and positive.

   Had AMERICANUS intended no more than to consider our claim, whether it
   should be made or not, as a matter of convenience only, which is the stage
   he has now brought it to, he ought by no means to have made even the
   slightest stroke at the right itself; because to omit making the claim in
   the treaty, and to assign the doubtfulness of the right as a reason for
   the omission, is to surrender the fisheries upon the insufficiency of the
   pretension, and of consequence to exclude ourselves from the practice by
   the silence of the treaty, and from the right by the reasons upon record.

   Had I time to laugh over my fish, I could in this place set AMERICANUS up
   to a very agreeable ridicule. He has all this while been angling without a
   bait, and endeavoring to deceive with an empty hook, and yet this man says
   he understands fishing as well as any man in America. "Very few," says,
   he, "and I speak it without vanity, are better acquainted with the
   fisheries than myself." If this be true, which I hope it is not, it is the
   best reason that can be given for relinquishing them, and if made known
   would, on the other hand, be a great inducement to Britain to cede the
   whole right, because by our being possessed of a right without knowing how
   to use it, she would be under no apprehensions of our thinning the ocean,
   and we should only go out with our vessels to buy, and not to catch.

   If AMERICANUS wished to persuade the Americans to say nothing about the
   fisheries in a treaty with Britain, he ought, as a politician of some kind
   or other, to have baited his hook with a plausible something, and, instead
   of telling them that their right was doubtful, he should have assured them
   it was indisputable, that Britain never meant to question it, that it was
   needless to say anything about it, that all nations knew our rights, and
   naturally meant to acknowledge them. But he, like a wiseacre, has run
   against the post instead of running past [t, and has, by the arguments he
   has used, produced a necessity for doing the very thing he was writing to
   prevent; and yet this man says he understands fishing as well as any man
   in America-It must be a cod indeed that should be catched by him. 

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, July-12, 1779.

   (THIRD LETTER - From the Pennsylvania Gazette, July 21, 1779.-Editor.)

   THE importance of the fisheries, AMERICANUS has kept almost totally out of
   sight. Why he has done so, his readers will contrive to guess at; or
   himself may explain. A bare confession, loosely scattered here and there,
   and marked with the countenance of reluctance, is all he gives on the
   subject. Surely, the public might have expected more from a man, who
   declares "he can, without vanity say, that very few are better acquainted
   with the nature and extent of the American fisheries than himself."

   If he really possesses the knowledge he affirms, he ought to have been as
   prolific on the subject as the fish he was treating of: And as he has not,
   I am obliged to suspect either the reality of his knowledge, or the
   sincerity of his intentions. If the declaration be not true, there are
   enough to fix his title; and if true, it shows that a man may keep company
   all his life-time with cod, and be little wiser. But to the point-

   There are but two natural sources of wealth and strength-the earth and the
   ocean-and to lose the right to either is, in our situation, to put up the
   other to sale. Without the fisheries, independence would be a bubble. It
   would not deserve the name; and however we might, in such a condition,
   please ourselves with the jingle of a word, the consequences that would
   follow would soon deprive us even of the title and the music.

   I shall arrange the fisheries under the three following heads:

   First. As an employment.

   Secondly. As producing national supply and commerce, and a means of
   national wealth.

   Thirdly. As a nursery for seamen.

   As an employment, by which a living is procured, it more immediately
   concerns those who make it their business; and in this view, which is the
   least of the three, such of the states, or parts thereof, which do not
   follow fishing, are not so directly interested as those which do. I call
   it the least of the three, because as no man needs want employment in
   America, so the change from one employment to another, if that be all, is
   but little to him, and less to anybody else. And this is the narrow,
   impolitic light in which some persons have understood the fisheries.

   But when we view them as producing national supply and commerce, and a
   means of national wealth, we then consider the fish, not the fishermen,
   and regard the consequences of the employment more than the employment
   itself; in the same manner that I distinguish the coat that clothes me,
   from the man that made it. In this view, we neither inquire (unless for
   curiosity) who catch the fish, or whether they catched themselves-how they
   were catched, or where? The same supply would be produced, the same
   commerce occasioned, and the same wealth created, were they, by a natural
   impulse, to throw themselves annually on the shore, or be driven there by
   a periodical current or storm. And taking it in this point, it is no more
   to us, than it was to the Israelites whether the manna that fed them was
   brought there by an angel or an insect, an eastern or a western breeze, or
   whether it was congealed dew, or a concretion of vegetable juices. It is
   sufficient that they had manna, and we have fish.

   I imagine myself within compass, when I suppose the fisheries to
   constitute a fourth part of the staple commerce of the United States, and
   that with this extraordinary advantage, it is a commerce which interferes
   with none, and promotes others. Take away a fourth from any part and the
   whole United States suffers, in the same manner that the blood taken from
   the arm is drained from the whole man; and if, by the unskilfulness of the
   operation, the wounded arm should lose its use, the whole body would want
   its service. It is to no purpose for a man to say, I am not a fisherman,
   an indigo planter, a rice planter, a tobacco planter, or a corn planter,
   any more than for the leg to say, I am not an arm; for as, in the latter
   instance the same blood invigorates both and all by circulation, so, in
   the former, each is enriched by the wealth which the other creates, and
   fed by the supply the other raises.

   Were it proposed that no town should have a market, are none concerned
   therein but butchers?

   And in like manner it may be asked, that if we lose the market for fish,
   are none affected thereby but those who catch them? He who digs the mine,
   or tills the earth, or fishes in the ocean, digs, tills and fishes for the
   world. The employment and the pittance it procures him are his; but the
   produce itself creates a traffic for thousands, a supply for millions.

   The Eastern States by quitting agriculture for fishing become customers to
   the rest, partly by exchange and partly by the wealth they import. Of the
   Middle States, they purchase grain and flour; of Maryland and Virginia,
   tobacco, the food and pastime of the fisherman; of North and South
   Carolina, and Georgia, rice and indigo. They may not hap- pen to become
   the client of a lawyer in either of these states, but is it any reason
   that we are to be deprived of fish, one of the instruments of commerce,
   because it comes to him without a case?

   The loss of the fisheries being at this time blended with other losses,
   which all nations at war are more or less subject to, is not particularly
   felt or distinguished in the general suspension: And the men who were
   employed therein being now called off into other departments, and
   supported by other means, feel not the want of the employment. War, in
   this view, contains a temporary relief for its own misfortunes, by
   creating a trade in lieu of the suspended one. But when, with the
   restoration of peace, trade shall open, the case will be very and widely
   different, and the fisherman like the farmer will expect to return to his
   occupation in quietude.

    As my limits will not allow me to range, neither have I time if I had
   room, I shall close this second head, and proceed to the third, and finish
   with some remarks on the state the question is now said to stand in
   Congress.

   If as an employment one fourth of the United States are immediately
   affected, and if as a source of national supply and commerce and a means
   of national wealth all are deeply interested, what shall we say when we
   consider it as a nursery for seamen? Here the question seems to take
   almost a reversed turn, for the states which do not fish are herein more
   concerned than those which do. It happens, by some disposition of
   Providence or ourselves, that those particular states whose employment is
   to fish are thickly settled, and secured by their internal strength from
   any extensive ravages of an enemy. The states, all the way from thence to
   the southward, beginning at New York, are less populous, and have less of
   that ability in proportion to their extent. Their security, therefore,
   will hereafter be in a navy, and without a fishery there can be no navy
   worthy of the name.

   Has nature given us timber and iron, pitch and tar, and cordage if we
   please, for nothing but to sell or burn? Has experience taught us the art
   of shipbuilding equal to any people on earth to become the workmen of
   other nations? Has she surrounded our coast with fisheries to create
   strength to our enemies, and make us the purchasers of our own property?
   Has she brought those fisheries almost to our own doors, to insult us with
   the prospect, and at the same time that she bar us from the enjoyment to
   threaten us with the constant approach of an enemy? Or has she given these
   things for our use, and instructed us to combine them for our own
   protection? Who, I ask, will undertake to answer me, AMERICANUS or myself?

   What would we now give for thirteen ships of the line to guard and protect
   the remote or weaker parts? How would Carolina feel deliverance from
   danger, and Georgia from despair, and assisted by such a fleet become the
   prison of their invaders? How would the Whigs of New York look up and
   smile with inward satisfaction at the display of an admiral's command,
   opening, like a "key," the door of their confinement? How would France
   solace herself at such a union of force, and reciprocally assisting and
   assisted traverse the ocean in safety? Yet all these, or their similar
   consequences, are staked upon the fisheries.

   AMERICANUS may understand the "nature of fisheries," as to season,
   catching and curing, or their "extent" as to latitude and longitude; but
   as a great political question, involving with it the means and channels of
   commerce, and the probability of empire, he is wholly unequal to the
   subject, or he would not have, as he has done, limited their effects to
   "two or three states especially." By a judgment acquired from long
   acquaintance, he may be able to know a cod when he sees it, or describe
   the inconveniences or pleasures of a fishing voyage. Or, "born and
   educated" (King of England's first speech to the British
   Parliament.-Author.) among them, he may entertain us with the growling
   memories of a Newfoundland bear, or amuse us with the history of a foggy
   climate or a smoky hut, with all the winter chit-chat of fatigue and
   hardship; and this, in his idea, may be to "understand the fisheries."

   I will venture to predict that America, even with the assistance of all
   the fisheries, will never be a great, much less a dangerous naval power,
   and without them she will be scarcely any. I am established in this
   opinion from the known cast and order of things. No country of a large
   extent ever yet, I believe, was powerful at sea, or ever will be. The
   natural reason of this appears to be that men do not, in any great
   numbers, turn their thoughts to the ocean, till either the country gets
   filled, or some peculiar advantage or necessity tempts them out. A
   maritime life is a kind of partial emigration, produced from a portion of
   the same causes with emigrations in general. The ocean becomes covered and
   the supply kept up from the constant swarmings of the landed hive; and as
   we shall never be able to fill the whole dominion of the Thirteen States,
   and there will ever be new land to cultivate, the necessity can never take
   place in America, and of course the consequences can never happen.

   Paradoxical as it may appear, greatness at sea is the effect of littleness
   by land. Want of room and want of employ are the generating causes.
   Holland has the most powerful navy in the world, compared with the small
   extent of her crowded country. France and Spain have too much room, and
   the soil too luxuriant and tempting, to be quitted for the ocean. Were not
   this the case, and did the abilities for a navy like those for land
   service rise in proportion to the number of inhabitants only, France would
   rival more than any two powers in Europe, which is not the case. Had not
   nature thrown the fisheries in our way and inflicted a degree of natural
   sterility on such parts of the continent as lie contiguous thereto, by way
   both of forcing and tempting their inhabitants to the ocean, America,
   considering the present cast of the world, would have wanted the means of
   defense, for the far greater part of our seamen, except those produced by
   the fisheries, are natives of other countries. And shall we unwisely
   trifle with what we ought to hug as a treasure, and nourish with the
   utmost care as a protector? And must the W. H. D. forever mean that We
   Have Dunces?

   We seek not a fleet to insult the world, or range in foreign regions for
   conquests. We have more land than we can cultivate; more extent than we
   can fill. Our natural situation frees us from the distress of crowded
   countries, and from the thirst of ambitious ones. We covet not dominion,
   for we already possess a world; we want not to export our laboring poor,
   for where can they live better, or where can they be more useful? But we
   want just such a fleet as the fisheries will enable us to keep up, and
   without which we shall be for ever exposed, a burden to our allies, and
   incapable of the necessary defense. The strength of America, on account of
   her vast extent, cannot be collected by land; but since experience has
   taught us to sail, and nature has put the means in our power, we ought in
   time to make provision for a navy, as the cheapest, safest, best, and most
   effectual security we can hereafter depend on.

   Having in my first and second publications endeavored to establish the
   right of America to the fisheries, and in this treated of their vast
   importance, I shall conclude with some remarks on the subject, as it is
   now said to stand in Congress, or rather the form in which it is thrown
   out to the public.

   AMERICANUS says (and I ask not how he came by his knowledge) that the
   question is, "Whether the insisting on an explicit acknowledgment of that
   right (meaning the right of fishing on the Banks of Newfoundland) is
   either safe, prudent or politic."

   Before I enter on the discussion of this point, it may not be improper to
   remark, that some intimations were made to Congress in February by the
   Minister of France, Mr. Gerard, respecting what the claims of America
   might be, in case any treaty of peace should be entered on with the enemy.
   And from this, with some account of the general disposition of the powers
   of Europe, the mighty buzz of peace took its rise, and several who ought
   to have known better, were whispering wonderful secrets at almost every
   tea table.

   It was a matter very early supposed by those who had any clear judgment,
   that Spain would not immediately join in the war, but would lie by as a
   mediatorial power. If she succeeded therein, the consequence would be
   peace; if she failed, she would then be perfectly at liberty to fulfill
   her engagements with France, etc.

   Now in order to enable Spain to act this part, it was necessary that the
   claims of Congress in behalf of America should be made known to their own
   Plenipotentiary at Paris, Dr. Franklin, with such instructions, public or
   private, as might be proper to give thereon. But I observe several
   members, either so little acquainted with political arrangements, or
   supposing their constituents to be so, that they treat with Mr. Gerard as
   if that gentleman was our Minister, instead of the Minister of his Most
   Christian Majesty, and his name is brought in to a variety of business to
   which it has no proper reference. This remark may to some appear rather
   severe, but it is a necessary one. It is not every member of Congress who
   acts as if he felt the true importance of his character, or the dignity of
   the country he acts for. And we seem in some instances to forget, that as
   France is the great ally of America, so America is the great ally of
   France.

   It may now be necessary to mention, that no instructions are yet gone to
   Dr. Franklin as a line for negotiation, and the reason is because none are
   agreed on. The reason why they are not agreed on is another point. But had
   the gentlemen who are for leaving the fisheries out agreed to have had
   them put in, instructions might have been sent more than four months ago;
   and if not exactly convenient, might by this time have been returned and
   reconsidered. On whose side then does the fault lie?

   I profess myself an advocate, out of doors, for clearly, absolutely, and
   unequivocally ascertaining the right of the states to fish on the Banks of
   Newfoundland, as one of the first and most necessary articles. The right
   and title of the states thereto I have endeavored to show. The importance
   of these fisheries I have endeavored to prove. What reason then can be
   given why they should be omitted?

   The seeds of almost every former war have been sown in the injudicious or
   defective terms of the preceding peace. Either the conqueror has insisted
   on too much, and thereby held the conquered, like an overbent bow, in a
   continual struggle to snap the cord, or the latter has artfully introduced
   an equivocal article, to take such advantages under as the turn of future
   affairs might afford. We have only to consult our own feelings, and each
   man may from thence learn the spring of all national policy. And he, who
   does not this, may be fortunate enough to effect a temporary measure, but
   never will, unless by accident, accomplish a lasting one.

   Perhaps the fittest condition any countries can be in to make a peace,
   calculated for duration, is when neither is conquered, and both are tired.
   The first of these suits England and America. I put England first in this
   case, because she began the war. And as she must be and is convinced of
   the impossibility of conquering America, and as America has no romantic
   ideas of extending her conquests to England, the object of the part of
   England is lost, and on the part of America is so far secure, that, unless
   she unwisely conquers herself, she is certain of not being conquered; and
   this being the case, there is no visible object to prevent the opening a
   negotiation. But how far England is disposed thereto is a matter wholly
   unknown, and much to be doubted.

   A movement toward a negotiation, and a disposition to enter into it, are
   very distinct things. The first is often made, as an army affects to
   retreat, in order to throw an enemy off his guard. To prevent which, the
   most vigorous preparations ought to be made for war at the very instant of
   negotiating for a peace.

   Let America make these preparations, and she may send her terms and claims
   whenever she pleases, without any apprehension of appearing or acting out
   of character. Those preparations relate now more to revenue than to force,
   and that being wholly and immediately within the compass of our own
   abilities, requires nothing but our consent to accomplish.(A plan has been
   proposed, and all who are judges have approved it, for stopping the
   emissions [of paper money] and raising a revenue, by subscription for
   three years without interest, and in lieu thereof to take every
   subscriber's taxes out of his subscription, and the balance at the
   expiration of that time to be returned. If the states universally go into
   this measure, they will acquire a degree of strength and ability fitted
   either for peace or war. It is, I am clearly convinced, the best measure
   they can adopt, the best interest they can have, and the best security
   they can hold. In short, it is carrying on or providing against war
   without expense, because the remaining money in the country, after the
   subscriptions are made, will be equal in value to the whole they now hold.
   Boston has proposed the same measure.-Author.)

   To leave the fisheries wholly out, on any pretense whatever, is to sow the
   seeds of another war; and I will be content to have the name of an idiot
   engraven for an epitaph, if it does not produce that effect. The
   difficulties which are now given will become a soil for those seeds to
   grow in, and future circumstances will quicken their vegetation. Nations
   are very fond of appealing to treaties when it suits their purpose, and
   though America might afterwards assign her unquestioned right as a reason
   for her silence, yet all must know that treaties are never to be explained
   by presumption, but wholly by what is put in, and never by what is left
   out.

   There has not yet been an argument given for omitting the fisheries, but
   what might have been given as a stronger reason to the contrary. All which
   has been advanced rests only on supposition, and that failing, leaves them
   no foundation. They suppose Britain will not hereafter interrupt the
   right; but the case is, they have no right to that supposition; and it may
   likewise be parried by saying-suppose she should? Now the matter, as I
   conceive it stands thus-

   If the right to the States to fish on the Banks of Newfoundland be made
   and consented to as an article in a treaty with Britain, it of consequence
   becomes expressly guaranteed by the eleventh article of the present treaty
   of alliance with France; but if it be left out in a treaty with the
   former, it is not then guaranteed in the present treaty with the latter,
   because the guaranteeing is limited to "the whole of their (our)
   possessions, as the same shall be fixed and assured to the said states at
   the moment of the cessation of their present war with England." Art. II.

   Were the states to claim, as a memorial to be recorded with themselves, an
   exclusive right to those fisheries, as a matter of right only, derived
   from natural situation, and to propose to their allies to guarantee to
   them expressly so much of that right as we may have occasion to use, and
   the states to guarantee to such allies such portions of the fisheries as
   they possessed by the last treaty of peace, there might be some pretense
   for not touching on the subject in a treaty with Britain; because, after
   the conclusion of the war, she would hardly venture to interrupt the
   states in a right, which, though not described in a treaty with her,
   should be powerfully guaranteed in a treaty with others. But to omit it
   wholly in one treaty, and to leave it unguaranteed in another, and to
   trust it entirely, as the phrase is, to the chapter of accidents, is too
   loose, too impolitic a mode of conducting national business.

   Had nothing, says AMERICANUS, being said on the subject of the fisheries,
   our fishermen, on the peace, might have returned to their old stations
   without interruption.

   Is this talking like an American politician, or a seducing emissary? Who
   authorized AMERICANUS to intimate such an assurance; or how came he to
   know what the British Ministry would or would not hereafter do; or how can
   he be certain they have told him truth? If it be supposition only, he has,
   as I before remarked, no right to make it; and if it be more than
   supposition, it must be the effect of secret correspondence. In the first
   of these cases he is foolish fin the second worse. Does he not see that
   the fisheries are not expressly and only conditionally guaranteed, and
   that if in such a situation they be omitted in a treaty with Britain, and
   she should afterwards interrupt our right, that the States stand single in
   the question, and have no right on the face of the present treaties to
   call on their allies for assistance? And yet this man is persuading us to
   say nothing about them.

   AMERICANUS like some others is mightily fond of amusing his readers with
   "the law of nations," just as if there really was such a law, fixed and
   known like the law of the ten commandments. Whereas the law of nations is
   in theory the law of treaties compounded with customary usage, and in
   practice just what they can get and keep till it be taken from them. It is
   a term without any regular defined meaning, and as in some instances we
   have invented the thing first and given the name afterwards, so in this we
   have invented the name and the thing is yet to be made.

   Some gentlemen say, leave the fisheries to be settled afterwards in a
   treaty of commerce. This is really beginning business at the wrong end.
   For a treaty of peace cannot precede the settlement of disputes, but
   proceeds in consequence of all controverted points respecting right and
   dominion being adjusted and agreed on. There is one kind of treaty of
   commerce which may follow a treaty of peace, but that respects such
   articles only and the mode of trafficking with them as are produced
   within, or imported into the known and described dominions of the parties;
   or to the rules of exchange, or paying or recovering debts, but never to
   the dominion itself; and comes more properly within the province of a
   consul than the superior contracting powers.

   With these remarks I shall, for the present, close the subject. It is a
   new one, and I have endeavored to give it as systematical an investigation
   as the short time allowed and the other business I have on hand will admit
   of. How the affair stands in Congress, or how the cast of the House is on
   the question, I have, for several reasons, not inquired into; neither have
   I conversed with any gentleman of that body on the subject. They have
   their opinion and I mine; and as I choose to think my own reasons and
   write my own thoughts, I feel the more free the less I consult.

   Who the writer of AMERICANUS is I am not informed. I never said or ever
   believed it to be Mr. Gouverneur Morris, or replied to it upon that
   supposition. The manner is not his, neither do I know that the principles
   are, and as that gentleman has disavowed it, the assurance is sufficient.
   I have likewise heard it supposed that Mr. Deane is the author, and that
   his friend Mr. Langworthy carried it to the press. But I know not who the
   author is. I have replied to the piece rather than to the man; though for
   the sake of relief to the reader and amusement to myself, he now and then
   comes in for a stroke.

   COMMON SENSE.
