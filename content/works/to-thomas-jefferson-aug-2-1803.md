   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Bordenton on the Delaware Aug. 2. 1803

   Dear Sir

   I enclose a letter for Mr. Breckenridge, but as I knew not his residence
   in Kentucky I will be obliged to you fill up the direction and
   forward it to him after putting a Wafer on it. I send it to you open
   as it relates to the order of the day, Louisiana.

   I know not what are your ideas as to the mode of beginning Government in
   the Ceded Country; but as we have thought a like on several subjects I make
   you a present of mine.

   I take it for granted that the present inhabitants know little or nothing
   of election and representation as Constituting a Government. They are
   therefore not in an immediate condition to exercise those powers, and
   besides this they are perhaps too much under the influence of their
   priests to be sufficiently free.

   I should suppose that a *Government provisoire* formed by Congress for
   three, five, or seven years would be the best mode of beginning. In the
   mean time they may be initiated into the practice by electing their
   municipal Government, and after some experience they will be in train to
   elect their state Government.

   I think it would not only be good policy but right to say that the people
   shall have the right of electing their Church Ministers, otherwise their
   Ministers will hold by authority from the Pope. I do not make it a
   compulsive Article but to put it in their power to use it when they
   please. It will serve to hold the priests in a stile of good behavior, and
   also to give the people an Idea of elective rights. Any thing, they say,
   will do to learn upon, and therefore they may as well begin upon priests.

   The present prevailing language is french and spanish, but it will be
   necessary to establish schools to teach english as the laws ought to be in
   the language of the Union.

   As soon as you have formed any plan for settling the Lands I shall be glad
   to know it. My motive for this is, because there are thousands and tens of
   thousands in England and Ireland and also in Scotland, who are friends of
   mine by principle, and who would gladly change their present country and
   condition. Many among them, for I have friends in all ranks of life in
   those Countries, are capable of becoming monied purchasers to any amount.

   If you can give me any hints respecting Louisiana the quantity in square
   miles, the population, and amount of the present Revenue I will find an
   opportunity of making some use of it. When the formalities of the cession
   are compleated the next thing will be to take possession and I think it
   would be very consistant for the president of the United States to do this
   in person.

   What is Dayton gone to New Orleans for? Is he there as an Agent for the
   British as Blount was said to be?

   As there will be but little time from the 17 October to the completion of
   the six months it will require dispatch to be strictly in form. I know not
   your manner of communicating with Congress, but as both houses have
   already acted upon the business I would think it would be right to send a
   copy of the Cession to each of them. This is not done in the case of
   Treaty; but as the instrument of the Cession is not of the nature of a
   Treaty, because it does not connect us with a foreign government which
   Treaties always do, the communication of it by Congress should keep
   clear of all the formalities of a Treaty. The federal Papers appear
   disposed to throw some stumbling block in the way and I see none they can
   lay hold of but that of construing it into a Treaty and rejecting it by a
   minority.

   Report says that Mr. Monroe is gone to Madrid to negociate for the
   Floridas. If it be so and is not a secret I should be glad to
   know it.

   Yours in friendship

   Thomas Paine

   I will be obliged to you to let your Servant take the enclosed to Mr.
   Collman.
