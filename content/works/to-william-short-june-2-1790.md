   To William Short  June 4, 1790

   LONDON,

   DEAR SIR:

   This is the third letter I have written you and I begin it before I know
   what the News of the day is. You will hear something about the return of
   the English Messenger, but you are to understand this is not the Messenger
   who was sent on the 6th of May with the peremptory demand. His name is
   Basilico. This is Flint who was sent off some days previous to B with
   dispatches overland to Gibralter. Flint, I believe, passed through Madrid
   on his return while B was there but nothing transpires from anything which
   Flint has brought. The Stocks rose upon the return of F and a report was
   immediately circulated that Spain had signed an unconditional Submission.
   They fell again (one 7s. 6d.) yesterday. The total inability of France to
   take any Part is yet in everybody's mouth, but I believe some of them
   begin to fear or think otherwise.

   The Statement delivered in by M. Necker has given me infinite pleasure. I
   never had any doubt upon the final Success of the French finances.
   National wealth may be created by opinion as in England. But in France
   where there are mines of real resources, time and good management cannot
   fail to bring them forth.

   The preparations for war here goes on. It signifies not doing things by
   halves, and therefore till France and Spain exert themselves fully England
   will ever be an insolent neighbor, bullying first one, and then the other.
   Yet were a combined fleet now to come up the Channel, this City (London)
   would be in the most perfect consternation, for they have lived so long
   without being molested at home, that they are become Bullies abroad and
   Cowards at home.

   Doctor Franklin has finished his Career. He died the Saturday befor[e] the
   27th of April. Congress goes into Mourning a Month on the Occasion. Old
   Mr. Vaughn who writes the letter from Philadelphia says that his funeral
   procession was attended by the greatest Concourse of people he ever saw
   except the Coronation at London. Not only the streets, windows, and roofs
   but the tops of the chimneys were covered with people.

   Mr. Casertir showed me a letter from Boyd and Carr house, Paris, which
   says that the Prussian Treasury is a sec (dry). The letter is from
   Furguson. I imagine that the King of Prussia has collected an Army too
   unwieldy for his resources.

   Adieu. Let me hear from you some how or other. If you do not choose to
   write by M. de la Lucerne's dispatches, write to me under Cover to Mr.
   Parker No. 18 Leicester Square.

   Yours truly

   There is much talk that the fleet preparing here about 12 or 14 Sail of
   the Line will go into the Baltic.
