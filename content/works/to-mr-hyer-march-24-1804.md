   From the original letter at the New-York Historical Society.

   March 24, 1804

   ear Sir

   I received your letter by Mr. Nixon and also a former letter but I have
   been so unwell this Winter with a fit of gout, tho' not so bad as I had
   at Bordenton about 20 years ago, that I could not write, and after I
   got better I got a fall on the Ice in the yard where I lodge that threw
   me back for above a month. I was obliged to get a person to copy off the
   letter to the people of England, published in the Aurora, March 7 as I
   dictated it verbally, for all the time my complaint continued, my health
   and spirits were as good as ever. &mdash; It was my intention to have cut a 
   large quantity of wood for the New York market, and in that case you would have
   had the money directly, but this accident and the Gout prevented me from
   doing any thing. I shall now have to take up some money upon it, which I
   shall do by the first of May to put Mrs. Bonneville into business and I
   shall then discharge her bill - in the meantime I wish you to recieve a
   quarter's rent due on the 1st of April from Mrs. Richardson, at $25 per
   ann - and to call on Mrs. Read for 40 or 50 dollars, or what you can get,
   and to give a receipt in my name. Col. Kirkbride should have discharged
   your bill, it was what he engaged to do. Mrs. Wharton owes for the rent of
   the house while she lived in it, unless Col. Kirkbride has taken it into
   his account. Samuel Hileyar owes me 84 dollars lent him in hard money. &mdash; 
   Mr. Nixon spoke to me about hiring my house, but as I did not know if Mrs.
   Richardson intended to stay in it or quit it I could give no positive
   answer, but said I would write to you about it. Israel Butler also writes
   me about taking at the same rent as Richardson pays. I will be obliged to
   you to let the house as you may judge best. I shall make a visit to
   Bordenton in the spring and I shall call at your house first.

   There have been several arrivals here in short passages from England. By the 
   last accounts old George is gone mad again.
   Peter Porcupine, I see, is become the panegyrist of Bonaparte. You will
   see it in the Aurora of March 19, and also the message of Bonaparte to the
   french legislature. It is a good thing.

   Mrs. Bonneville sends her compliments. She would have wrote but she cannot
   venture yet to write in English. 
   
   Yours in friendship

   Thomas Paine
   No. 16 Gold Street N. Y -

   I congratulate you on your new appointment.
