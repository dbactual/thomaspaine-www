   DEAR SIR :

   With a great deal of pleasure I welcome your return to America, where, I

   make him a sharer of my congratulations.

   I shall be very glad to receive a line from you, and to hear how Mr. and
   Mrs. Williams and Mr. Alexanders] family are, how our old friend the
   Marquis De la Fayette is, and such other matters as may occur to you.

   I am Dear Sir, your sincere friend and obedient humble servant

   THOMAS PAINE.
