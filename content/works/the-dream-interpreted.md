   The context of "The Dream Interpreted" should have also raised some questions regarding Paine’s authorship.
   The fact that it took place in Bucks County (signed "Bucks County"), which is across the river from Bordentown
   in Pennsylvania, though not definitive, would not fit in with Paine’s movements in the first five months in America.
   The reference to a "fatiguing journey from Virginia" in the first sentence of the article should also have raised questions,
   since there is no indication that Paine could have made time to venture such a trip. Bucks County would be the last leg
   of a trip from Virginia to Bordentown. It would not be part of an itinerary from Virginia to Philadelphia where Paine
   resided at that time. Paine’s physical involvement in Bordentown did not begin until 1778.
    Hopkinson also used the device of dreams in other Pennsylvania Magazine articles, such as "The Revery" and
   "The Extraordinary Dream". Hopkinson’s more classical style fits this employment of dreams, as does his sweeping
   grandiose metaphors. In this period of his life, Hopkinson had set aside his musical compositions to focus on
   experimental writing styles, hence his frequent contributions to the Pennsylvania Magazine.

   THE DREAM INTERPRETED

   PARCHED with thirst and wearied with a fatiguing journey to Virginia, I
   turned out of the road to shelter myself among the shades; in a little
   time I had the good fortune to light on a spring, and the refreshing
   draught went sweetly down. How little of luxury does nature want! This
   cooling stream administered more relief than all the wines of Oporto; I
   drank and was satisfied; my fatigue abated, my wasted spirits were
   reinforced, and 'tis no wonder after such a delicious repast that I sunk
   insensibly into slumber. The wildest fancies in that state of
   forgetfulness always appear regular and connected; nothing is wrong in a
   dream, be it ever so unnatural. I am apt to think that the wisest men
   dream the most inconsistently. For as the judgment has nothing or very
   little to do in regulating the circumstances of a dream, it necessarily
   follows that the more powerful and creative the imagination is, the wilder
   it runs in that state of unrestrained invention; while those who are
   unable to wander out of the track of common thinking when awake, never
   exceed the boundaries of common nature when asleep.

   But to return from my digression, which in this place is nothing more than
   that wandering of fancy which every dream is entitled to, and which cannot
   in either case be applied to myself, as in the dream I am about to relate
   I was only a spectator, and had no other business to do than to remember.

   To what scene or country my ideas had conveyed themselves, or whether they
   had created a region on purpose to explore, I know not, but I saw before
   me one of the most pleasing landscapes I have ever beheld. I gazed at it,
   till my mind partaking of the prospect became incorporated therewith, and
   felt all the tranquility of the place. In this state of ideal happiness I
   sat down on the side of a mountain, totally forgetful of the world I had
   left behind me. The most delicious fruits presented themselves to my
   hands, and one of the clearest rivers that ever watered the earth rolled
   along at the foot of the mountain, and invited me to drink. The distant
   hills were blue with the tincture of the skies, and seemed as if they were
   the threshold of the celestial region. But while I gazed the whole scene
   began to change, by an almost insensible gradation. The sun, instead of
   administering life and health, consumed everything with an intolerable
   heat. The verdure withered. The hills appeared burnt and black. The
   fountains dried away; and the atmosphere became a motionless lake of air,
   loaded with pestilence and death. After several days of wretched
   suffocation, the sky grew darkened with clouds from every quarter, till
   one extended storm excluded the face of heaven. A dismal silence took
   place, as if the earth, struck with a general panic, was listening like a
   criminal to the sentence of death. The glimmering light with which the sun
   feebly penetrated the clouds began to fail, till Egyptian darkness added
   to the horror. The beginning of the tempest was announced by a confusion
   of distant thunders, till at length a general discharge of the whole
   artillery of heaven was poured down upon the earth. Trembling I shrunk
   into the side of a cave, and dreaded the event. The mountain shook, and
   threatened me with instant destruction. The rapid lightning at every blaze
   exhibited the landscape of a world on fire, while the accumulating
   torrent, not in rain, but floods of water, resembled another deluge.

   At length the fury of the storm abated, and nature, fatigued with fear and
   watching, sank into rest. But when the morning rose, and the universal
   lamp of heaven emerged from the deep, how was I struck with astonishment!
   I expected to have seen a world in ruins, which nothing but a new creation
   could have restored. Instead of which, the prospect was lovely and
   inviting, and had all the promising appearance of exceeding its former
   glory. The air, purged of its poisonous vapors, was fresh and healthy. The
   dried fountains were replenished, the waters sweet and wholesome. The
   sickly earth, recovered to new life, abounded with vegetation. The groves
   were musical with innumerable songsters, and the long-deserted fields
   echoed with the joyous sound of the husbandman. All, all was felicity; and
   what I had dreaded as an evil, became a blessing. At this happy reflection
   I awoke; and having refreshed myself with another draught from the
   friendly spring, pursued my journey.

   After travelling a few miles I fell in with a companion, and as we rode
   through a wood but little frequented by travellers, I began, for the sake
   of chatting away the tediousness of the journey, to relate my dream. I
   think, replied my friend, that I can interpret it. That beautiful country
   which you saw is America. The sickly state you beheld her in has been
   coming on her for these ten years past. Her commerce has been drying up by
   repeated restrictions, till by one merciless edict the ruin of it is
   completed. The pestilential atmosphere represents that ministerial
   corruption which surrounds and exercises its dominion over her, and which
   nothing but a storm can purify. The tempest is the present contest, and
   the event will be the same. She will rise with new glories from the
   conflict, and her fame be established in every corner of the globe; while
   it will be remembered to her eternal honor that she has not sought the
   quarrel, but has been driven into it. He who guides the natural tempest
   will regulate the political one, and bring good out of evil. In our
   petition to Britain we asked but for peace; but the prayer was rejected.
   The cause is now before a higher court, the court of providence, before
   whom the arrogance of kings, the infidelity of ministers, the general
   corruption of government, and all the cobweb artifice of courts, will fall
   confounded and ashamed.

   BUCKS COUNTY.
