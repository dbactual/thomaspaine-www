   To Thomas Jefferson January 1, 1805

   NEW ROCHELLE,

   DEAR SIR:

   I have some thoughts of coming to Washington this winter, as I may as well
   spend a part of it there as elsewhere. But lest bad roads or any other
   circumstance should prevent me I suggest a thought for your consideration,
   and I shall be glad if in this case, as in that of Louisiana, we may
   happen to think alike without knowing what each other had thought of.

   The affair of Domingo will cause some trouble in either of the cases in
   which it now stands. If armed merchantmen force their way through the
   blockading fleet it will embarrass us with the French Government; and, on
   the other hand, if the people of Domingo think that we show a partiality
   to the French injurious to them there is danger they will turn Pirates
   upon us, and become more injurious on account of vicinity than the barbary
   powers, and England will encourage it, as she encourages the Indians.
   Domingo is lost to France either as to the Government or the possession of
   it. But if a way could be found out to bring about a peace between France
   and Domingo through the mediation, and under the guarantee of the United
   States, it would be beneficial to all parties, and give us a great
   commercial and political standing, not only with the present people of
   Domingo but with the West Indies generally. And when we have gained their
   confidence by acts of justice and friendship, they will listen to our
   advice in matters of Civilization and Government, and prevent the danger
   of their becoming pirates, which I think they will be, if driven to
   desperation.

   The United States is the only power that can undertake a measure of this
   kind. She is now the Parent of the Western world, and her knowledge of the
   local circumstances of it gives her an advantage in a matter of this kind
   superior to any European Nation. She is enabled by situation, and
   grow[ing] importance to become a guarantee, and to see, as far as her
   advice and influence can operate, that the conditions on the part of
   Domingo be fulfilled. It is also a measure that accords with the humanity
   of her principles, with her policy, and her commercial interest.

   All that Domingo wants of France, is, that France agree to let her alone,
   and withdraw her forces by sea and land; and in return for this Domingo to
   give her a monopoly of her commerce for a term of years, -that is, to
   import from France all the utensils and manufactures she may have occasion
   to use or consume (except such as she can more conveniently procure from
   the manufactories of the United States), and to pay for them in produce.
   France will gain more by this than she can expect to do even by a conquest
   of the Island, and the advantage to America will be that she will become
   the carrier of both, at least during the present war.

   There was considerable dislike in Paris against the Expedition to Domingo;
   and the events that have since taken place were then often predicted. The
   opinion that generally prevailed at that time was that the commerce of the
   Island was better than the conquest of it,-that the conquest could not be
   accomplished without destroying the Negroes, and in that case the Island
   would be of no value.

    I think it might be signified to the French Government, yourself is the
   best judge of the means, that the United States are disposed to undertake
   an accommodation so as to put an end to this otherwise endless slaughter
   on both sides, and to procure to France the best advantages in point of
   commerce that the state of things will admit of. Such an offer, whether
   accepted or not, cannot but be well received, and may lead to a good end.

   There is now a fine snow, and if it continues I intend to set off for
   Philadelphia in about eight days, and from thence to Washington. I
   congratulate your constituents on the success of the election for
   President and Vice-President.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.
