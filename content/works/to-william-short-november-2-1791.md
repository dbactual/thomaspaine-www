   From the original letter at the Library of Congress
  
   London Novr 2, 1791
   
   Dear Sir

   I received your favour conveying a letter from Mr. Jefferson and the
   ans. to Publicola for which I thank you. I had John Adams in my mind
   when I wrote the pamphlet and it has hit as I expected.

   M. Lenobia who presents you this is come to pass a few days at Paris. He
   is a bon republicain and you will oblige me much by introducing him among
   our friends of bon foi. - I am again in the press but shall not be out till
   about Christmas, when the Town will begin to fill. By what I can find, the
   Government Gentry begin to threaten - they have already tried all the
   under-plots of abuse and scurrility without effect, and have managed those
   in general so badly as to make the work and the author the more famous -
   several ans. also have been written against it which did not excite
   reading enough to pay the expence of printing -

   I have but one way to be secure in my next work which is, to go further
   than in my first, I see that *great rogues* escape by the excess of their
   crimes, and, perhaps, it may be the same in honest cases. However, I shall
   make a pretty large division in the public opinion, probably too much so,
   to encourage the Government to put it to issue, for it will be rather like
   begging them than me.

   By all the accounts we have here, the french emigrants are in a hopeless
   condition abroad, for my own part I never saw anything to fear from
   foreign Courts - they are more afraid of the french Revolution than the
   revolution needs to be of them, and the same caution which they take to
   prevent the french principles getting among their Armies will prevent
   their sending Armies among the principles.

   We have distressing accounts here from St. Domingo. It is the natural
   consequence of Slavery and must be expected every where. The Negroes are
   enraged at the opposition made to their relief and are determined, if not
   to relieve themselves, to punish their enemies. We have no new accounts
   from the East Indies, and people are in much doubt.

   I am affectionately yours

   THOMAS PAINE
