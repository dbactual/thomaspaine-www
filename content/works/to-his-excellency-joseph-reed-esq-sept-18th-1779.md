   From the original letter at the New-York Historical Society.

   Market Street Sept. 18th. 1779

   Sir

   I had the honor this morning of receiving by the hands of your Servant
   your favor of a printed copy respecting Govr. Johnstone's offer, but
   the suddenness with which the bearer returned and my not understanding his
   message till I saw your name on the cover, occasioned that neglect of my
   thanks which I now request you to accept.

   Mr. Matlack mentioned to me some time ago your design of publishing the
   particulars, and I signified to him my willingness to assist in arranging
   them (as I presume you cannot have much time for purposes of this kind)
   and the matter is such an Evidence of the principle on which their
   Commissionary Negotiation where intended to be carried on, that the making
   them fully known was highly necessary.

   I did not, I believe, attend to Mr. Matlack's message so much as I might
   otherwise have done, because it was somewhat indelicately introduced by
   his asking me How I lived? And consequently the subsequent part had more
   the appearance of employment than confidential friendship. Besides which I
   felt my disposition considerably hurt by the inattention shewn to me last
   winter, tho' it must be easy to see that a great part of the opposition
   I had then to go through respecting Deane's Affairs was from resentment to
   what I had published on the Constitution at a time the opposers of it were
   hoping to be successful. 
   
   I think I have done better by the State, than the
   State has by me; and I cannot but look upon it a reflection either on one
   the other, that after sharing in every difficulty and rendering every
   service in my power for more than four years, that the only State I have
   lived in in America, which must be supposed to know most of the matter and
   which had individually derived some assistance from me, should be so
   willing to receive and so very backward to acknowledge. I know it will do
   no good to publish these things, and unpleasant as they be to put up with
   I yet think it best to do so. But I confess myself unable to account for
   them and if there is any thing which I do not understand or have
   misconceived I should be glad to have it pointed out, for it is neither
   agreeable or useful to live under a mistake with those who have the same
   public object in view with myself.
