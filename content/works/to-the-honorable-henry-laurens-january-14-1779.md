   To the Honorable Henry Laurens  January 14, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   SIR:

   My anxiety for your personal safety has not only fixed a profound silence
   upon me, but prevents my asking you a great many questions, lest I should
   be the unwilling, unfortunate cause of new difficulties or fatal
   consequences to you, and in such a case I might indeed say, " "T is the
   survivor dies!"

   I omitted sending the enclosed in the morning as I intended. It will serve
   you to parry ill nature and ingratitude with, when undeserved reflections
   are cast upon me.

   I certainly have some awkward natural feeling, which I never shall get rid
   of. I was sensible of a kind of shame at the Minister's door to-day, lest
   any one should think I was going to solicit a pardon or a pension. When I
   come to you I feel only an unwillingness to be seen, on your account. I
   shall never make a courtier, I see that. I am your obedient humble
   servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   January 14, 1779.

   SIR :

   For your amusement I give you a short history of my conduct since I have
   been in America.

   I brought with me letters of introduction from Dr. Franklin. These letters
   were with a flying seal, that I might, if I thought proper, close them
   with a wafer. One was to Mr. Bache of this city. The terms of Dr.
   Franklin's recommendation were "a worthy, ingenious, etc!' My particular
   design was to establish an academy on the plan they are conducted in and
   about London, which I was well acquainted with. I came some months before
   Dr. Franklin, and waited here for his arrival. In the meantime a person of
   this city desired me to give him some assistance in conducting a magazine,
   which I did without making any bargain. The work turned out very
   profitable. Dr. Witherspoon had likewise a concern [in] it. At the end of
   six months I thought it necessary to come to some contract. I agreed to
   leave the matters to arbitration. The bookseller mentioned two on his own
   part-Mr. Duche, your late chaplain, and Mr. Hopkinson. I agreed to them
   and declined mentioning any on my part. But the bookseller getting
   information of what Mr. Duche's private opinion was, withdrew from the
   arbitration, or rather refused to go into it, as our agreement to abide by
   it was only verbal. I was requested by several literary gentlemen in this
   city to undertake such a work on my own account, and I could have rendered
   it very profitable.

   As I always had a taste to science, I naturally had friends of that cast
   in England; and among the rest George Lewis Scott, Esq., through whose
   formal introduction my first acquaintance with Dr. Franklin commenced. I
   esteem Mr. Scott as one of the most amiable characters I know of, but his
   particular situation had been that in the minority of the present King he
   was his sub-preceptor, and from the occasional traditionary accounts yet
   remaining in the family of Mr. Scott, I obtained the true character of the
   present King from his childhood upwards, and, you may naturally suppose,
   of the present ministry. I saw the people of this country were all wrong,
   by an ill-placed confidence. After the breaking out of hostilities I was
   confident their design was a total conquest. I wrote to Mr. Scott in May,
   1775, by Captain James Josiah, now in this city. I read the letter to him
   before I closed it. I used in it this free expression: "Surely the
   ministry are all mad; they never will be able to conquer America." The
   reception which the last petition of Congress met with put it past a doubt
   that such was their design, on which I determined with myself to write the
   pamphlet [Common] Sense. As I knew the time of the Parliament meeting, and
   had no doubt what sort of King's speech it would produce, my contrivance
   was to have the pamphlet come out just at the time the speech might arrive
   in America, and so fortunate was I in this cast of policy that both of
   them made their appearance in this city on the same day. [January 10,
   1776].

   The first edition was printed by Bell on the recommendation of Dr. Rush. I
   gave him the pamphlet on the following conditions: That if any loss should
   arise I would pay it-and in order to make him industrious in circulating
   it, I gave him one-half the profits, if it should produce any. I gave a
   written order to Col. Joseph Dean and Capt. Thos. Prior, both of this
   city, to receive the other half, and lay it out for mittens for the troops
   that were going to Quebec. I did this to do honor to the cause. Bell kept
   the whole, and abused me into the bargain. The price he set upon them was
   two shillings. I then enlarged the pamphlet with an appendix and an
   address to the Quakers, which made it one-third bigger than before,
   printed 6,000 at my own expense, 3,000 by B. Towne, 3,000 by Styner &
   Cist, and delivered them ready stitched and fit for sale to Mr. Bradford
   at the Coffee-house; and though the work was thus increased, and
   consequently should have borne a higher price, yet, in order that it might
   produce the general service I wished, I confined Mr. Bradford to sell them
   at only One shilling each, or tenpence by the dozen, and to enable him to
   do this, with sufficient advantage to himself, I let him have the
   pamphlets at 8d. Pennsylvania currency each.

   The sum of 8 1/2d. each was reserved to defray the expense of printing,
   paper, advertising, etc., and such as might be given away. The state of
   the account at present is that I am -L-39 11s out of pocket, being the
   difference between what I have paid for printing, etc., and what I have
   received from Bradford. He has a sufficiency in his hands to balance with
   and clear me, which is all I aimed at, but by his unaccountable
   dilatoriness and unwillingness to settle accounts I fear I shall be
   obliged to sustain a real loss exclusive of my trouble.

   I think the importance of that pamphlet was such that if it had not
   appeared, and that at the exact time it did, the Congress would not now
   have been sitting where they are. The light which that performance threw
   upon the subject gave a turn to the politics of America which enabled her
   to stand her ground. Independence followed in six months after it,
   although before it was published it was a dangerous doctrine to speak of,
   and that because it was not understood.

   In order to accommodate that pamphlet to every man's purchase and to do
   honor to the cause, I gave up the profits I was justly entitled to, which
   in this city only would at the usual price of books [have] produced me
   -L-1,000 at that time a day, besides what I might have made by extending
   it to other States. I gave permission to the printers in other parts of
   this State [Pennsylvania] to print it on their own account. I believe the
   number of copies printed and sold in America was not short of 150,000-and
   is the greatest sale that any performance ever had since the use of
   letters,-exclusive of the great run it had in England and Ireland.

   The doctrine of that book was opposed in the public newspapers under the
   signature of Cato, who, I believe, was Dr. Smith, and I was sent for from
   New York to reply to him, which I did, and happily with success. My
   letters are under the signature of "The Forester." It was like-wise
   opposed in a pamphlet signed Plain Truth, but the performance was too weak
   to do any hurt or deserve any answer. In July following the publication of
   Common Sense the Associators of this State marched to Amboy under the
   command of Gen. Roberdeau. The command was large, yet there was no
   allowance for a secretary. I offered my service voluntarily, only that my
   expenses should be paid, all the charges I put Gen. Roberdeau to was $48;
   although he frequently pressed me to make free with his private
   assistance. After the Associators returned I went to Fort Lee, and
   continued with Gen. [Nathanael] Greene till the evacuation.

   A few days after our army had crossed the Delaware on the 8th of December,
   1776, I came to Philadelphia on public service, and, seeing the deplorable
   and melancholy condition the people were in, afraid to speak and almost to
   think, the public presses stopped, and nothing in circulation but fears
   and falsehoods, I sat down, and in what I may call a passion of patriotism
   wrote the first number of the Crisis. It was published on the 19th of
   December, which was the very blackest of times, being before the taking of
   the Hessians at Trenton. I gave that piece to the printer gratis, and
   confined him to the price of two coppers, which was sufficient to defray
   his charge.

   I then published the second number, which, being as large again as the
   first number, I gave it to him on the condition of his taking only four
   coppers each. It contained sixteen pages.

   I then published the third number, containing thirty-two pages, and gave
   it to the printer, confining him to ninepence.

   When the account of the battle of Brandywine got to this city, the people
   were again in a state of fear and dread. I immediately wrote the fourth
   number [of the Crisis}. It contained only four pages, and as there was no
   less money than the sixth of dollars in general circulation, which would
   have been too great a price, I ordered 4,000 to be printed at my own
   private charge and given away.

   The fifth number I gave Mr. Dunlap, at Lancaster. He, very much against my
   consent, set half a crown upon it; he might have done it for a great deal
   less. The sixth and seventh numbers I gave in the papers. The seventh
   number would have made a pamphlet of twenty-four pages, and brought me in
   $3,000 or $4,000 in a very few days, at the price which it ought to have
   borne.

   Monies received since I have been in America:

   Salary for 17 months at 70 dollars per month             1,190 dollars

   For rations and occasional assistance at Fort Lee         141 ditto

   For defraying the expense of a journey from East Town round

   by Morriss when secretary to the Indian Commission, and

   some other matters, about 140 or 145 dollars            145 ditto

   Total of public money                 1,476

   In the spring, 1776, some private gentleman, thinking it was too hard that
   I should, after giving away my profits for a public good, be money out of
   pocket on account of some expense I was put to-sent me by the hands of Mr.
   Christopher Marshall 108 dollars.

   You have here, sir, a faithful history of my services and my rewards.
