   To Elisha Babcock  July 2, 1805.

   NEW ROCHELLE,

   CITIZEN :

   In your paper of June 27, in a piece containing remarks on a paragraph in
   the Norwich Centinel the writer of the remarks speaking of what several of
   the feds had said, adds the dissemination of these sentiments was only a
   preliminary measure to the acceptance of the proposal made by Great
   Britain and circulated secretly among the most influential federalists,
   Hamilton for one, viz, "That Great Britain should cede Canada to the
   United States on condition that the Duke of Clarence should be placed on
   the American throne and recognized as the monarch of America." This might
   have been easily answered by saying We have blackguards enon of our own.

   I will, however, be obliged to you if you can give me any information
   respecting this proposal as it may be traced to some source. You will
   recollect that Oliver Ellsworth after his mission expired in France, went
   over to England, and I informed you nearly two years ago that he had
   declared himself a monarchist in a company of 10 or 12 persons and I gave
   you the name of the gentleman who told me of it and who was one of the
   company but you made no use of the information.

   My last letter (the 8th) is the most important of any I have published. I
   have been disappointed in not seeing it in your paper. I have reason to
   believe the matters therein stated will be taken up at the next meeting of
   Congress, and the inquiry at that time, will not be sufficiently
   understood by those who had not an opportunity of seeing that letter. I
   know the feds want to keep that letter out of sight.

   Yours in friendship

   THOMAS PAINE.
