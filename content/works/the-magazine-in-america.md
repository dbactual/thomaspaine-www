Title: The Magazine in America

   This essay was the first which Paine wrote for the Pennsylvania Magazine
   and appeared in the January 24, 1775 issue.]

   In a country whose reigning character is the love of science, it is
   somewhat strange that the channels of communication should continue so
   narrow and limited. The weekly papers are at present the only vehicles of
   public information. Convenience and necessity prove that the opportunities
   of acquiring and communicating knowledge ought always to inlarge with the
   circle of population. America has now outgrown the state of infancy: her
   strength and commerce make large advances to manhood; and science in all
   its branches has not only blossomed, but even ripened on the soil. The
   cottages as it were of yesterday have grown to villages, and the villages
   to cities; and while proud antiquity, like a skeleton in rags, parades the
   streets of other nations, their genius, as if sickened and disgusted with
   the phantom, comes hither for recovery.

   The present enlarged and improved state of things gives every
   encouragement which the editor of a New Magazine can reasonably hope for.
   Change of times adds propriety to new measures. In the early days of
   colonization, when a whisper was almost sufficient to have negotiated all
   our internal concerns, the publishing even of a newspaper would have been
   premature. those times are past; and population has established both their
   use and their credit. but their plan being almost wholly devoted to news
   and commerce, affords but a scanty resident to the Muses. Their path lies
   wide of the field of science, and has left a rich and unexplored region
   for new adventurers.

   It has always been the opinion of the learned and curious, that a
   magazine, when properly conducted, is the nursery of genius: and by
   constantly accumulating new matter, becomes a kind of market for wit and
   utility. The opportunities which it affords to men of abilities to
   communicate their studies, kindle up a spirit of invention and emulation.
   An unexercised genius soon contracts a kind of mossiness, which not only
   checks its growth, but abates its natural vigour. Like an untenanted house
   it falls into decay, and frequently ruins the possessor.

   The British magazines, at their commencement, were the repositories of
   ingenuity: They are now the retailers of tale and nonsense. From elegance
   they sunk to simplicity, from simplicity to folly, and from folly to
   voluptuousness. The Gentleman's, the London, and the Universal, Magazines,
   bear yet some marks of their originality; but the Town and Country, the
   Covent-Garden, and the Westminster, are no better than incentives to
   profligacy and dissipation. They have added to the dissolution of manners,
   and supported Venus against the Muses.

   America yet inherits a large portion of her first-imported virtue.
   Degeneracy is here almost a useless word. Those who are conversant with
   Europe would be tempted to believe that even the air of the Atlantic
   disagrees with the constitution of foreign vices; if they survive the
   voyage, they either expire on their arrival, or linger away in an
   incurable consumption. There is a happy something in the climate of
   America, which disarms them of all their power both of infection and
   attraction.

   But while we give no encouragement to the importation of foreign vices, we
   ought to be equally as careful not to create any. A vice begotten might be
   worse than a vice imported. The latter, depending on favour, would be a
   sycophant; the other, by pride of birth, would be a tyrant: To the one we
   should be dupes, to the other slaves.

   There is nothing which obtains so general an influence over the manners
   and moral of a people as the Press; from that, as from a fountain, the
   streams of vice or virtue are poured forth over a country: And of all
   publications, none are more calculated to improve or infect than a
   periodical one. All others have their rise and their exit: but this  renew
   the pursuit. If it has an evil tendency, it debauches by the power of
   repetition; if a good one, it obtains favor by the gracefulness of
   soliciting it. Like a lover, it woods its mistress with unabated ardor,
   nor gives up the pursuit without a conquest.

   The two capital supports of a magazine are Utility and Entertainment: The
   first is a boundless path, the other an endless spring. To suppose that
   arts and sciences are exhausted subjects, is doing them a kind of
   dishonour.

   The divine mechanism of creation reproves such folly, and shews us by
   comparison, the imperfection of our most refined inventions.  I cannot
   believe that this species of vanity is peculiar to the present age only. I
   have to doubt but that it existed before the flood, and even in the
   wildest ages of antiquity. 'Tis folly we have inherited, not created; and
   the discovers which every day produces, have greatly contributed to
   dispossess us of it. Improvement and the world will expire together; And
   till that period arrives, we may plunder the mine, but can never exhaust
   it! That 'We have found out every thing,' has been the motto of every age.
   Let our ideas travel a little into antiquity, and we shall find larger
   portions of it than now; and so unwilling were our ancestors to descend
   from this mountain of perfection, that when any new discovery exceed the
   common standard, the discovered was believed to be in alliance with the
   devil. It was not the ignorance of the age only, but the vanity of it,
   which rendered it dangerous to be ingenious. the man who planned and
   erected a tenable hut, with a hole for the smoke to pass, and the light to
   enter, was perhaps called an able architect, but he who first improved it
   with a chimney, could be no less than a prodigy; yet had the same man been
   so unfortunate as to have embellished with glass windows, he might
   probably have been burnt for a magician. Our fancies would be highly
   diverted could we look back, and behold a circle of original Indians
   haranguing on the sublime perfection of the age; Yet 'tis not impossible
   but future times may exceed us almost a much as have exceeded them.

   I would wish to extirpate the least remains of this impolitic vanity. It
   has a direct tendency to unbrace the nerves of inventions, and is
   peculiarly hurtful to young colonies. A magazine can never want matter in
   America, if the inhabitants will do justice to their own abilities.,
   Agriculture and manufactures owe much of the improvement in England, to
   hints first thrown out in some of their magazines. Gentlemen who abilities
   enabled them to make experiments, frequently chose that method of
   communication, on account of its convenience,. And who should not the same
   spirit operate in America? I have to doubt of seeing, in a little time, an
   American magazine full of more useful matter than I never saw an English
   one: Because we are not exceeded in abilities, have a more extensive field
   for enquiry; and, whatever may be out political state, Our happiness will
   always depend upon ourselves.
   Something useful will always arise from exercising the invention, though
   perhaps, like the witch of Endor, we shall raise up a being we did not
   expect. We owe many of our noblest discoveries more to accident than
   wisdom. In quest of a pebble we have found a diamond, and returned
   enriched with the treasure. Such happy accidents give additional
   encouragement to the making experiments; and the convenience which a
   magazine affords of collecting and conveying them to the public, enhances
   their utility. Where this opportunity is wanting, many little inventions,
   the forerunners of improvement, are suffered to expire on the spot that
   produced them; and, as an elegant writer beautifully expresses on another
   occasions,

   They waste their sweetness on the desert air. - Gray

   In matter of humour and entertainment there can be no reason to apprehend
   a deficiency. Wit is naturally a volunteer, delights in action, and under
   proper disciple is capable of great execution. 'Tis a perfect master in
   the art of bush-fighting; and though it attacks with more subtility than
   science, has often defeated a whole regiment of heavy artillery. Though I
   have rather exceed the line of gravity in this description of wit, I am
   unwilling to dismiss it without being a little more serious. 'This a
   qualification which, like the passions, has a natural wildness that
   requires governing. Life to itself, it soon overflows its banks, mixes
   with common filth, and brings disrepute on the fountain. We have many
   valuable springs of it in America , which at present run purer streams,
   than the generality of it in other countries. In France and Italy, 'tis
   froth highly fomented: In England it has much of the same spirit, but
   rather a browner complexion. European wit is one of the worst articles we
   can import. It has an intoxicating power with it, which debauches the very
   vitals of chastity, and gives a false colouring to every thing it censures
   or defends. We soon grow fatigued with the excess, and withdraw like
   gluttons sickened with intemperance. On the contrary, how happily are the
   sallies of innocent humour calculated to amuse and sweeten the vacancy of
   business! We enjoy the harmless luxury without surfeiting, and the
   strengthen the spirits by relaxing them.

   The Press has not only a great influence over our manners and morals, but
   contributes largely to our pleasures; and a magazine when properly
   enriched, is very conveniently calculated for this purpose. Voluminous
   works weary the patience, but here we are invited by conciseness and
   variety. As I have formerly received much pleasure from perusing these
   kind of publications, I wish the present  success; and have no doubt of
   seeing a proper diversity blended to agreeable together, as to furnish out
   an Olio  worthy of the company for whom it is designed.

   I consider a magazine as a kind of bee-hive, which both allures the swarm,
   and provides room to store their sweets. Its division in cells, gives
   every bee a province of its own; and though they all produce hone, yet
   perhaps they differ in their taste for flowers, and extract with great
   dexterity from one than from another. Thus, we are not all PHILOSOPHERS,
   all ARTISTS, nor all POETS.
