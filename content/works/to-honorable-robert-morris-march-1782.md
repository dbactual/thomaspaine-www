   To Honorable Robert Morris, Esq.  March 1782

   SIR:

   I shall get out a piece tomorrow on the King of England's speech, and I
   have sent to all the printers to secure a place in the Wednesday papers.
   As I have not time to enter on the whole business of Revenue in tomorrow's
   piece, I shall dispose of it so as to endeavor to create an animated
   disposition in the country-and shall follow it with another piece in the
   next week's papers on the subject of Revenue, of which I shall give
   notice. In the meantime I shall take the liberty of consulting you and Mr.
   G. Morris.

   I am, Sir, your Obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
