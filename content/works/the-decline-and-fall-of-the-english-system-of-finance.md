   "On the verge, nay even in the gulf of bankruptcy." Debates in Parliament

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This pamphlet was written in Paris, and completed April 8, 1796. It was
   published simultaneously in France, England and America, and soon
   circulated all over Europe. So important did the English government regard
   the pamphlet, that it commissioned two pamphleteers, Ralph Broome and
   George Chalmers, to write a reply. The French government ordered 1,000
   copies of the pamphlet nineteen days after it was first published. For
   other effects of this pamphlet, see below pp. 1387-1388.

   Paine's purpose in writing the pamphlet is clearly set forth in a letter
   he sent to the French government. He writes:

   "CITIZENS: I present you with a small work entitled The Decline and Fall
   of the English System of Finance, in which I have explained and ex- posed
   the finances of your principal enemy, the government of England. If I have
   any capacity in judging of circumstances, and from thence of probable
   events, the fall of that government is very nearly at hand.

   "The condition in which that government finds itself at this moment is
   curious and critical, and different to anything it ever experienced
   before. It is now pressed by two internal and formidable opponents that
   never appeared during any former war. The one is, the great and
   progressive change of opinion that is spreading itself throughout England
   with respect to the hereditary system of government. That system has
   fallen more in the opinion of the people of that country within the last
   four years preceding the French revolution. The other is, that the funding
   system of finance, on which the government of England depends for
   pecuniary aid, is now explaining itself to be no other than a governmental
   fraud.

   "In former wars the government of England was supported by the
   superstition of the country with respect to a nominal non-existing thing
   which is called a constitution; and by the credulity of the country as to
   the funding system of finance. It was from these two popular delusions
   that the government of England derived all its strength, and they are now
   deserting her standard. When this monster of national fraud and maritime
   oppression, the government of England, shall be overthrown, the world will
   be freed from a common enemy, and the two nations may count upon
   fraternity and a lasting peace.

   THOMAS PAINE."

   NOTHING, they say, is more certain than death, and nothing more uncertain
   than the time of dying; yet we can always fix a period beyond which man
   cannot live, and within some moment of which he will die. We are enabled
   to do this, not by any spirit of prophecy or foresight into the event, but
   by observation of what has happened in all cases of human or animal
   existence.

   If then any other subject, such, for instance, as a system of finance,
   exhibits in its progress a series of symptoms indicating decay, its final
   dissolution is certain, and the period of it can be calculated from the
   symptoms it exhibits.

   Those who have hitherto written on the English system of finance (the
   funding system) have been uniformly impressed with' the idea that its
   downfall would happen some time or other. They took, however, no data for
   their opinion, but expressed it predictively, or merely as opinion, from a
   conviction that the perpetual duration of such a system was a natural
   impossibility. It is in this manner that Dr. Price has spoken of it; and
   [Adam] Smith, in his "Wealth of Nations" has spoken in the same manner;
   that is, merely as opinion without data.

   "The progress," says Smith, "of the enormous debts, which at present
   oppress, and will in the long run most probably ruin, all the great
   nations of Europe [he should have said governments] has been pretty
   uniform." But this general manner of speaking, though it might make some
   impression, carried with it no conviction.

   It is not my intention to predict anything; but I will show from data
   already known, from symptoms and facts which the English funding system
   has already exhibited publicly, that it will not continue to the end of
   Mr. Pitt's life, supposing him to live the usual age of a man. How much
   sooner it may fall I leave to others to predict.

   Let financiers diversify systems of credit as they will, it is
   nevertheless true, that every system of credit is a system of paper money.
   Two experiments have already been had upon paper money; the one in
   America, the other in France.

   In both those cases the whole capital was emitted, and that whole capital,
   which in America was called Continental money, and in France assignats,
   appeared in circulation; the consequence of which was, that the quantity
   became so enormous, and so disproportioned to the quantity of population,
   and to the quantity of objects upon which it could be employed, that the
   market, if I may so express it, was glutted with it and the value of it
   fell.

   Between five and six years determined the fate of those experiments. The
   same fate would have happened to gold and silver, could gold and silver
   have been issued in the same abundant manner that paper had been, and
   confined within the country as paper money always is, by having no
   circulation out of it; or, to speak on a larger scale, the same thing
   would happen in the world, could the world be glutted with gold and
   silver, as America and France have been with paper.

   The English system differs from that of America and France in this one
   particular, that its capital is kept out of sight; that is, it does not
   appear in circulation. Were the whole capital of the national debt, which
   at the time I write is almost one hundred million pounds sterling, to be
   emitted in assignats, or bills, and that whole quantity put into
   circulation, as was done in America and in France, those English
   assignats, or bills, would soon sink in value as those of America and
   France have done; and that in a greater degree, because the quantity of
   them would be more disproportioned to the quantity of population in
   England, than was the case in either of the other two countries. A nominal
   pound sterling in such bills would not be worth one penny.

   But though the English system, by thus keeping the capital out of sight,
   is preserved from hasty destruction, as in the case of America and France,
   it nevertheless approaches the same fate, and will arrive at it with the
   same certainty, though by a slower progress.

   The difference is altogether in the degree of speed by which the two
   systems approach their fate, which, to speak in round numbers, is as
   twenty is to one; that is, the English system, that of finding the capital
   instead of issuing it, contained within itself a capacity of enduring
   twenty times longer than the systems adopted by America and France; and at
   the end of that time it would arrive at the same common grave, the
   potter's field of paper money.

   The datum I take for this proportion of twenty to one, is the difference
   between a capital and the interest at five per cent. Twenty times the
   interest is equal to the capital. The accumulation of paper money in
   England is in proportion to the accumulation of the interest upon every
   new loan; and therefore the progress to the dissolution is twenty times
   slower than if the capital were to be emitted and put into circulation
   immediately. Every twenty years in the English system is equal to one year
   in the French and American systems.

   Having thus stated the duration of the two systems, that of funding upon
   interest, and that of emitting the whole capital without funding, to be as
   twenty to one, I come to examine the symptoms of decay, approaching to
   dissolution, that the English system has already exhibited, and to compare
   them with similar systems in the French and American systems.

   The English funding system began one hundred years ago; in which time
   there have been six wars, including the war that ended in 1697.

   1. The war that ended, as I have just said, in 1697.

   2. The war that began in 1702.

   3. The war that began in 1739.

   4. The war that began in 1756.

   5. The American war, that began in 1775.

   6. The present war, that began in 1793.

   The national debt, at the conclusion of the war which ended in 1697, was
   twenty-one millions and an half. (See Smith's "Wealth of Nations," chapter
   on Public Debts.) We now see it approaching fast to four hundred millions.
   If between these two extremes of twenty-one millions and four hundred
   millions, embracing the several expenses of all the including wars, there
   exist some common ratio that will ascertain arithmetically the amount of
   the debts at the end of each war, as certainly as the fact is known to be,
   that ratio will in like manner determine what the amount of the debt will
   be in all future wars, and will ascertain the period within which the
   funding system will expire in a bankruptcy of the Government; for the
   ratio I allude to, is the ratio which the nature of the thing has
   established for itself.

   Hitherto no idea has been entertained that any such ratio existed, or
   could exist, that would determine a problem of this kind; that is, that
   would ascertain, without having any knowledge of the fact, what the
   expense of any former war had been, or what the expense of any future war
   would be; but it is nevertheless true that such a ratio does exist, as I
   shall show, and also the mode of applying it.

   The ratio I allude to is not in arithmetical progression like the numbers
   2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; nor yet in geometrical progression, like the
   numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256; but it is in the series of one half
   upon each preceding number; like the numbers 8, 12, 18, 27, 40, 60 90,
   135.

   Any person can perceive that the second number, 12, is produced by the
   preceding number 8, and half 8; and that the third number, 18, is in like
   manner produced by the preceding number, 12, and half 12; and so on for
   the rest. They can also see how rapidly the sums increase as the ratio
   proceeds. The difference between the two first numbers is but four; but
   the difference between the two last is forty-five; and from thence they
   may see with what immense rapidity the national debt has increased, and
   will continue to increase, till it exceeds the ordinary powers of
   calculation, and loses itself in ciphers.

   I come now to apply the ratio as a rule to determine in all cases.

   I began with the war that ended in 1697, which was the war in which the
   funding system began. The expense of that war was twenty-one millions and
   an half. In order to ascertain the expense of the next war, I add to
   twenty-one millions and a half, the half thereof (ten millions and three
   quarters) which makes thirty-two millions and a quarter for the expense of
   that war. This thirty-two millions and a quarter, added to the former debt
   of twenty-one millions and an half, carries the national debt to
   fifty-three millions and three quarters. Smith, in his chapter on Public
   Debts, says, that the national debt was at this time fifty-three millions.

   I proceed to ascertain the expense of the next war, that of 1739, by
   adding, as in the former case, one-half to the expense of the preceding
   war. The expense of the preceding war was thirty-two millions and a
   quarter; for the sake of even numbers, say thirty-two millions; the half
   of which (16) makes forty-eight millions for the expense of that war.

   I proceed to ascertain the expense of the War of 1756, by adding,
   according to the ratio, one-half to the expense of the preceding war. The
   expense of the preceding was taken at forty-eight millions, the half of
   which (24) makes seventy-two millions for the expense of that war. Smith
   (chapter on Public Debts) says the expense of the war of 1756 was
   seventy-two millions and a quarter.

   I proceed to ascertain the expense of the American war, of 1775, by
   adding, as in the former cases, one-half to the expense of the preceding
   war. The expense of the preceding war was seventy-two millions, the half
   of which (36) makes 108 millions for the expense of that war. In the last
   edition of Smith (chapter on Public Debts), he says, the expense of the
   American war was more than an hundred millions.

   I come now to ascertain the expense of the present war, supposing it to
   continue as long as former wars have done, and the funding system not to
   break up before that period. The expense of the preceding war was 108
   millions, the half of which (54) makes 162 millions for the expense of the
   present war. It gives symptoms of going beyond this sum, supposing the
   funding system not to break up; for the loans of the last year and of the
   present year are twenty-two millions each, which exceeds the ratio
   compared with the loans of the preceding war.

   It will not be from the inability of procuring loans that the system will
   break up. On the contrary, it is the facility with which loans can be
   procured that hastens that event. The loans are altogether paper
   transactions; and it is the excess of them that brings on, with
   accelerating speed, that progressive depreciation of funded paper money
   that will dissolve the funding system.

   I proceed to ascertain the expense of future wars, and I do this merely to
   show the impossibility of the continuance of the funding system, and the
   certainty of its dissolution.

   The expense of the next war after the present war, according to the ratio
   that has ascertained the preceding cases, will be:

   243 millions.

   Expense of the second war 364 "

   " " " third war 546

   " " fourth war 819

   " " fifth war 1228

   -L-3200 millions

   which, at only four per cent will require taxes to the nominal amount of
   128 millions to pay the annual interest, besides the interest of the
   present debt, and the expenses of government, which are not included in
   this account. Is there a man so mad, so stupid, as to suppose this system
   can continue?

   When I first conceived the idea of seeking for some common ratio that
   should apply as a rule of measurement to all the cases of the funding
   system, so far as to ascertain the several stages of its approach to
   dissolution, I had no expectation that any ratio could be found that would
   apply with so much exactness as this does.

   1 was led to the idea merely by observing that the funding system was a
   thing in continual progression, and that whatever was in a state of
   progression might be supposed to admit of, at least, some general ratio of
   measurement, that would apply without any very great variation.

   But who could have supposed that falling systems, or falling opinions,
   admitted of a ratio apparently as true as the descent of falling bodies? I
   have not made the ratio any more than Newton made the ratio of
   gravitation. I have only discovered it, and explained the mode of applying
   it.

   To show at one view the rapid progression of the funding system to
   destruction, and to expose the folly of those who blindly believe in its
   continuance, and who artfully endeavor to impose that belief upon others,
   I exhibit in the annexed table, the expense of each of the six wars

   since the funding system began, as ascertained by ratio, and the expense
   of the six wars yet to come, ascertained by the same ratio.

   FIRST SIX WARS.

   1. 21 millions

   SECOND SIX WARS.

   4. 819 "

   5. 1228 "

   6. 1842 "

   Total -L-5042 "

   ( The actual expense of the War of 1739 did not come up to the sum
   ascertained by the ratio. But as that which is the natural disposition of
   a thing, as it is the natural disposition of a stream of water to descend,
   will, if impeded in its course, overcome by a new effort what it had lost
   by that impediment, so it was with respect to this war and the next (1756)
   taken collectively; for the expense of the War of 1756 restored the
   equilibrium of the ratio, as fully as if it had not been impeded. A
   circumstance that serves to prove the truth of the ratio more fully than
   if the interruption had not taken place. The War of 1739 was languid; the
   efforts were below the value of money at that time; for the ratio is the
   measure of the depreciation of money in consequence of the funding system;
   or what comes to the same end, it is the measure of the increase of paper.
   Every additional quantity of it, whether in bank notes or otherwise,
   diminishes the real, though not the nominal value of the former
   quantity.-Author.)

   Those who are acquainted with the power with which even a small ratio,
   acting in progression, multiplies in a long series, will see nothing to
   wonder at in this table. Those who are not acquainted with that subject,
   and not knowing what else to say, may be inclined to deny it. But it is
   not their opinion one way, nor mine the other, that can influence the
   event. The table exhibits the natural march of the funding system to its
   irredeemable dissolution.

   Supposing the present Government of England to continue, and to go on as
   it has gone on since the funding system began, I would not give twenty
   shillings for one hundred pounds in the funds to be paid twenty years
   hence. I do not speak this predictively; I produce the data upon which
   that belief is founded; and which data it is everybody's interest to know,
   who have anything to do with the funds, or who are going to bequeath
   property to their descendants to be paid at a future day.

   Perhaps it may be asked that as governments or ministers proceeded by no
   ratio in making loans or incurring debts, and nobody intended any ratio or
   thought of any, how does it happen that there is one? I answer that the
   ratio is founded in necessity; and I now go on to explain what that
   necessity is.

   It will always happen, that the price of labor, or of the produce of
   labor, be that produce what it may, will be in proportion to the quantity
   of money in a country, admitting things to take their natural course.
   Before the invention of the funding system, there was no other money than
   gold and silver; and as nature gives out those metals with a sparing hand,
   and in regular annual quantities from the mines, the several prices of
   things were proportioned to the quantity of money at that time, and so
   nearly stationary as to vary but little in any fifty or sixty years of
   that period.

   When the funding system began, a substitute for gold and silver began
   also. That substitute was paper; and the quantity increased as the
   quantity of interest increased upon accumulated loans. This appearance of
   a new and additional species of money in the nation soon began to break
   the relative value which money and the things it will purchase bore to
   each other before.

   Everything rose in price; but the rise at first was little and slow, like
   the difference in units between the two first numbers, 8 and 12, compared
   with the two last numbers, 90 and 135, in the table. It was, however,
   sufficient to make itself considerably felt in a large transaction. When
   therefore Government, by engaging in a new war, required a new loan, it
   was obliged to make a higher loan than the former loan, to balance the
   increased price to which things had risen; and as that new loan increased
   the quantity of paper in proportion to the new quantity of interest, it
   carried the price of things still higher than before.

   The next loan was again higher, to balance that further increased price;
   and all this in the same manner, though not in the same degree, that every
   new emission of Continental money in America, or of assignats in France,
   was greater than the preceding emission, to make head against the advance
   of prices, till the combat could be maintained no longer.

   Herein is founded the necessity of which I have just spoken. That
   necessity proceeds with accelerating velocity, and the ratio I have laid
   down is the measure of that acceleration; or, to speak the technical
   language of the subject, it is the measure of the increasing depreciation
   of funded paper money, which it is impossible to prevent while the
   quantity of that money and of bank notes continues to multiply. What else
   but this can account for the difference between one war costing twenty-one
   millions, and another war costing one hundred and sixty millions?

   The difference cannot be accounted for on the score of extraordinary
   efforts or extraordinary achievements. The war that cost twenty-one
   millions was the War of the Confederates, historically called the Grand
   Alliance, consisting of England, Austria and Holland in the time of
   William III, against Louis XIV, and in which the confederates were
   victorious.

   The present is a war of a much greater confederacy-a confederacy of
   England, Austria, Prussia, the German Empire, Spain, Holland, Naples and
   Sardinia, eight Powers, against the French Republic singly, and the
   Republic has beaten the whole Confederacy. But to return to my subject.

   It is said in England, that the value of paper keeps equal with the value
   of gold and silver. But the case is not rightly stated; for the fact is,
   that the paper has pulled down the value of gold and silver to a level
   with itself. Gold and silver will not purchase so much of any purchasable
   article at this day as if no paper had appeared, nor so much as it will in
   any country in Europe where there is no paper. How long this hanging
   together of money and paper will continue, makes a new case; because it
   daily exposes the system to sudden death, independent of the natural death
   it would otherwise suffer.

   I consider the funding system as being now advanced into the last twenty
   years of its existence. The single circumstance, were there no other, that
   a war should now cost nominally one hundred and sixty millions, which when
   the system began cost but twenty-one millions, or that the loan for one
   year only (including the loan to the Emperor) should now be nominally
   greater than the whole expense of that war, shows the state of
   depreciation to which the funding system has arrived.

   Its depreciation is in the proportion of eight for one, compared with the
   value of its money when the system began; which is the state the French
   assignats stood a year ago (March, 1795) compared with gold and silver. It
   is therefore that I say that the English funding system has entered on the
   last twenty years of its existence, comparing each twenty years of the
   English system with every single year of the American and French systems,
   as before stated.

   Again, supposing the present war to close as former wars have done, and
   without producing either revolution or reform in England, another war at
   least must be looked for in the space of the twenty years I allude to; for
   it has never yet happened that twenty years have passed off without a war,
   and that more especially since the English Government has dabbled in
   German politics, and shown a disposition to insult the world, and the
   world of commerce, with her navy.

   The next war will carry the national debt to very nearly seven hundred
   millions, the interest of which, at four per cent will be twenty-eight
   millions besides the taxes for the (then) expenses of government, which
   will increase in the same proportion, and which will carry the taxes to at
   least forty millions; and if another war only begins, it will quickly
   carry them to above fifty; for it is in the last twenty years of the
   funding system, as in the last year of the American and French systems
   without funding, that all the great shocks begin to operate.

   I have just mentioned that paper in England has pulled down the value of
   gold and silver to a level with itself; and that this pulling down of gold
   and silver money has created the appearance of paper money keeping up. The
   same thing, and the same mistake, took place in America and in France, and
   continued for a considerable time after the commencement of their system
   of paper; and the actual depreciation of money was hidden under that
   mistake.

   It was said in America, at that time, that everything was becoming dear;
   but gold and silver could then buy those dear articles no cheaper than
   paper could; and therefore it was not called depreciation. The idea of
   clearness established itself for the idea of depreciation. The same was
   the case in France. Though everything rose in price soon after assignats
   appeared, yet those dear articles could be purchased no cheaper with gold
   and silver, than with paper, and it was only said that things were dear.

   The same is still the language in England. They call it deariness. But
   they will soon find that it is an actual depreciation, and that this
   depreciation is the effect of the funding system; which, by crowding such
   a continually increasing mass of paper into circulation, carries down the
   value of gold and silver with it. But gold and silver will, in the long
   run, revolt against depreciation and separate from the value of paper; for
   the progress of all such systems appears to be that the paper will take
   the command in the beginning, and gold and silver in the end.

   But this succession in the command of gold and silver over paper makes a
   crisis far more eventful to the funding system than to any other system
   upon which paper can be issued; for, strictly speaking, it is not a crisis
   of danger but a symptom of death. It is a death-stroke to the funding
   system. It is a revolution in the whole of its affairs.

   If paper be issued without being funded upon interest, emissions of it can
   be continued after the value of it separates from gold and silver, as we
   have seen in the two cases of America and France. But the funding system
   rests altogether upon the value of paper being equal to gold and silver;
   which will be as long as the paper can continue carrying down the value of
   gold and silver to the same level to which itself descends, and no longer.

   But even in this state, that of descending equally together, the minister,
   whoever he may be, will find himself beset with accumulating difficulties;
   because the loans and taxes voted for the service of each ensuing year
   will wither in his hands before the year expires, or before they can be
   applied. This will force him to have recourse to emissions of what are
   called exchequer and navy bills, which, by still increasing the mass of
   paper in circulation, will drive on the depreciation still more rapidly.

   It ought to be known that taxes in England are not paid in gold and
   silver, but in paper (bank notes). Every person who pays any considerable
   quantity of taxes, such as maltsters, brewers, distillers (I appeal for
   the truth of it, to any of the collectors of excise in England, or to Mr.
   Whitebread), knows this to be the case.

   There is not gold and silver enough in the nation to pay the taxes in
   coin, as I shall show; and consequently there is not money enough in the
   bank to pay the notes. The interest of the national funded debt is paid at
   the bank in the same kind of paper in which the taxes are collected.

   When people find, as they will find, a reservedness among each other in
   giving gold and silver for bank notes, or the least preference for the
   former over the latter, they will go for payment to the bank, where they
   have a right to go. They will do this as a measure of prudence, each one
   for himself, and the truth or delusion of the funding system will then be
   proved.

   I have said in the foregoing paragraph that there is not gold and silver
   enough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin, and consequently that there
   cannot be enough in the bank to pay the notes. As I do not choose to rest
   anything upon assertion, I appeal for the truth of this to the
   publications of Mr. Eden (now called Lord Auckland) and George Chalmers,
   secretary to the Board of Trade and Plantation, of which Jenkinson (now
   Lord Hawkesbury) is president. (These sort of folks change their names so
   often that it is as difficult to know them as it is to know a thief.)

   Chalmers gives the quantity of gold and silver coin from the returns of
   coinage at the mint; and after deducting for the light gold recoined, says
   that the amount of gold and silver coined is about twenty millions. He had
   better not have proved this, especially if he had reflected that public
   credit is suspicion asleep. The quantity is much too little.

   Of this twenty millions (which is not a fourth part of the quantity of
   gold and silver there is in France, as is shown in Mr. Necker's treatise
   on the "Administration of the Finances") three millions at least must be
   supposed to be in Ireland, some in Scotland, and in the West Indies,
   Newfoundland, etc. The quantity therefore in England cannot be more than
   sixteen millions, which is four millions less than the amount of the
   taxes. But admitting that there are sixteen millions, not more than a
   fourth part thereof (four millions) can be in London, w.hen it is
   considered that every city, town, village and farmhouse in the nation must
   have a part of it, and that all the great manufactories, which most
   require cash, are out of London. Of this four millions in London, every
   banker, merchant, tradesman, in short every individual, must have some. He
   must be a poor shopkeeper indeed, who has not a few guineas in his till.

   The quantity of cash therefore in the bank can never, on the evidence of
   circumstances, be so much as two millions; most probably not more than one
   million; and on this slender twig, always liable to be broken, hangs the
   whole funding system of four hundred millions, besides many millions in
   bank notes.

   The sum in the bank is not sufficient to pay one-fourth of only one year's
   interest of the national debt, were the creditors to demand payment in
   cash, or demand cash for the bank notes in which the interest is paid, a
   circumstance always liable to happen.

   One of the amusements that has kept up the farce of the funding system is
   that the interest is regularly paid. But as the interest is always paid in
   bank notes, and as bank notes can always be coined for the purpose, this
   mode of payment proves nothing. The point of proof is, can the bank give
   cash for the bank notes with which the interest is paid? If it cannot, and
   it is evident it cannot, some millions of bank notes must go without
   payment, and those holders of bank notes who apply last will be worst oil.

   When the present quantity of cash in the bank is paid away, it is next to
   impossible to see how any new quantity is to arrive. None will arrive from
   taxes, for the taxes will all be paid in bank notes; and should the
   Government refuse bank notes in payment of taxes, the credit of bank notes
   will be gone at once. No cash will arise from the business of discounting
   merchants' bills; for every merchant will pay off those bills in bank
   notes, and not in cash. There is therefore no means left for the bank to
   obtain a new supply of cash, after the present quantity is paid away.

   But besides the impossibility of paying the interest of the funded debt in
   cash, there are many thousand persons in London and in the country who are
   holders of bank notes that came into their hands in the fair way of trade,
   and who are not stockholders in the funds; and as such persons have had no
   hand in increasing the demand upon the bank, as those have had who for
   their own private interest, like Boyd and others, are contracting or
   pretending to contract for new loans, they will conceive they have a just
   right that their bank notes should be

   first paid. Boyd has been very sly in France, in changing his paper into
   cash. He will be just as sly in doing the same thing in London, for he has
   learned to calculate; and then it is probable he will set off for America.

   A stoppage of payment at the bank is not a new thing. Smith in his "Wealth
   of Nations," book ii. chap. 2, says, that in the year 1696, exchequer
   bills fell forty, fifty and sixty per cent; bank notes twenty per cent;
   and the bank stopped payment. That which happened in 1696 may happen again
   in 1796.

   The period in which it happened was the last year of the War of King
   William. It necessarily put a stop to the further emissions of exchequer
   and navy bills and to the raising of new loans; and the peace which took
   place the next year was probably hurried on by this circumstance, and
   saved the bank from bankruptcy. Smith in speaking from the circumstances
   of the bank, upon another occasion, says (book ii. chap. 2), "This great
   company had been reduced to the necessity of paying in sixpences." When a
   bank adopts the expedient of paying in sixpences, it is a confession of
   insolvency.

   It is worthy of observation that every case of failure in finances, since
   the system of paper began, has produced a revolution in governments,
   either total or partial. A failure in the finances of France produced the
   French Revolution. A failure in the finance of the assignats broke up the
   revolutionary government, and produced the present French Constitution. A
   failure in the finances of the Old Congress of America and the
   embarrassments it brought upon commerce, broke up the system of the old
   confederation, and produced the Federal Constitution. If, then, we admit
   of reasoning by comparison of causes and events, the failure of the
   English finances will produce some change in the government of that
   country.

   As to Mr. Pitt's project of paying off the national debt by applying a
   million a year for that purpose, while he continues adding more than
   twenty millions a year to it, it is like setting a man with a wooden leg
   to run after a hare. The longer he runs the farther he is off.

   When I said that the funding system had entered the last twenty years of
   its existence, I certainly did not mean that it would continue twenty
   years, and then expire as a lease would do. I meant to describe that age
   of decrepitude in which death is every day to be expected, and life cannot
   continue long. But the death of credit, or that state that is called
   bankruptcy, is not always marked by those progressive stages of visible
   decline that marked the decline of natural life.

   In the progression of natural life age cannot counterfeit youth, nor
   conceal the departure of juvenile abilities. But it is otherwise with
   respect to the death of credit; for though all the approaches to
   bankruptcy may actually exist in circumstances, they admit of being
   concealed by appearances.

   Nothing is more common than to see the bankrupt of to-day a man in credit
   but the day before; yet no sooner is the real state of his affairs known
   than everybody can see he had been insolvent long before. In London, the
   greatest theater of bankruptcy in Europe, this part of the subject will be
   well and feelingly understood.

   Mr. Pitt continually talks of credit, and the national resources. These
   are two of the feigned appearances by which the approaches to bankruptcy
   are concealed. That which he calls credit may exist, as I have just shown,
   in a state of insolvency, and is always what I have before described it to
   be, suspicion asleep.

   As to national resources, Mr. Pitt, like all English financiers that
   preceded him since the funding system began, has uniformly mistaken the
   nature of a resource; that is, they have mistaken it consistently with the
   delusion of the funding system; but time is explaining the delusion. That
   which he calls, and which they call, a resource, is not a resource, but is
   the anticipation of a resource. They have anticipated what would have been
   a resource in another generation had not the use of it been so
   anticipated.

   The funding system is a system of anticipation. Those who established it
   an hundred years ago anticipated the resources of those who were to live
   an hundred years after; for the people of the present day have to pay the
   interest of the debts contracted at that time, and all debts contracted
   since. But it is the last feather that breaks the horse's back.

   Had the system begun an hundred years before, the amount of taxes at this
   time to pay the annual interest at four per cent (could we suppose such a
   system of insanity could have continued) would be two hundred and twenty
   millions annually; for the capital of the debt would be five thousand four
   hundred and eighty-six millions, according to the ratio that ascertains
   the expense of the wars of the hundred years that are past.

   But long before it could have reached this period, the value of bank
   notes, from the immense quantity of them (for it is in paper only that
   such a nominal revenue could be collected), would have been so low or
   lower than Continental paper has been in America, or assignats in France;
   and as to the idea of exchanging them for gold and silver, it is too
   absurd to be contradicted.

   Do we not see that nature, in all her operations, disowns the visionary
   basis upon which the funding system is built? She acts always by renewed
   successions, and never by accumulating additions perpetually progressing.
   Animals and vegetables, men and trees, have existed since the world began;
   but that existence has been carried on by succession of generations, and
   not by continuing the same men and the same trees in existence that
   existed first; and to make room for the new she removes the old.

   Every natural idiot can see this; it is the stock-jobbing idiot only that
   mistakes. He has conceived that art can do what nature cannot. He is
   teaching her a new system-that there is no occasion for man to die-that
   the scheme of creation can be carried on upon the plan of the funding
   system-that it can proceed by continual additions of new beings, like new
   loans, and all live together in eternal youth. Go, count the graves, thou
   idiot, and learn the folly of thy arithmetic!

   But besides these things there is something visibly farcical in the whole
   operation of loaning. It is scarcely more than four years ago that such a
   lot of bankruptcy spread itself over London that the whole commercial
   fabric tottered; trade and credit were at a stand; and such was the state
   of things that, to prevent or suspend a general bankruptcy, the Government
   lent the merchants six millions in Government paper, and now the merchants
   lend the Government twenty-two millions in their paper; and two parties,
   Boyd and Morgan, men but little known, contend who shall be the lenders.

   What a farce is this! It reduces the operation of loaning to accommodation
   paper, in which the competitors contend, not who shall lend, but who shall
   sign, because there is something to be got for signing.

   Every English stock-jobber and minister boasts of the credit of England.
   Its credit, say they, is greater than that of any country in Europe. There
   is a good reason for this: for there is not another country in Europe that
   could be made the dupe of such a delusion. The English funding system will
   remain a monument of wonder, not so much on account of the extent to which
   it has been carried, as of the folly of believing in it.

   Those who had formerly predicted that the funding system would break up
   when the debt should amount to one hundred or one hundred and fifty
   millions, erred only in not distinguishing between insolvency and actual
   bankruptcy; for the insolvency commenced as soon as the Government became
   unable to pay the interest in cash, or to give cash for the bank notes in
   which the interest was paid, whether that inability was known or not, or
   whether it was suspected or not.

   Insolvency always takes place before bankruptcy; for bankruptcy is nothing
   more than the publication of that insolvency. In the affairs of an
   individual, it often happens that insolvency exists several years before
   bankruptcy, and that the insolvency is concealed and carried on till the
   individual is not able to pay one shilling in the pound.

   A government can ward off bankruptcy longer than an individual: but
   insolvency will inevitably produce bankruptcy, whether in an individual or
   in a government. If then the quantity of bank notes payable on demand,
   which the bank has issued, is greater than the bank can pay off, the bank
   is insolvent: and when that insolvency is declared, it is bankruptcy.(*See
   footnote at the end of the essay.)

   I come now to show the several ways by which bank notes get into
   circulation: I shall afterwards offer an estimate on the total quantity or
   amount of bank notes existing at this moment.

   The bank acts in three capacities. As a bank of discount; as a bank of
   deposit; and as a banker for the Government.

   First, as a bank of discount. The bank discounts merchants' bills of
   exchange for two months. When a merchant has a bill that will become due
   at the end of two months, and wants payment before that time, the bank
   advances that payment to him, deducting therefrom at the rate of five per
   cent per annum. The bill of exchange remains at the bank as a pledge or
   pawn, and at the end of two months it must be redeemed.

   This transaction is done altogether in paper; for the profits of the bank,
   as a bank of discount, arise entirely from its making use of paper as
   money. The bank gives bank notes to the merchant in discounting the bill
   of exchange, and the redeemer of the bill pays bank notes to the bank in
   redeeming it. It very seldom happens that any real money passes between
   them.

   If the profits of a bank be, for example, -L-200,000 a year (a great sum
   to be made merely by exchanging one sort of paper for another, and which
   shows also that the merchants of that place are pressed for money for
   payments, instead of having money to spare to lend to government), it
   proves that the bank discounts to the amount of four millions annually, or
   -L-666,666 every two months; and as there never remain in the bank more
   than two months' pledges, of the value of -L-666,666, at any one time, the
   amount of bank notes in circulation at any one time should not be more
   than to that amount.

   This is sufficient to show that the present immense quantity of bank
   notes, which are distributed through every city, town, village, and
   farmhouse in England, cannot be accounted for on the score of discounting.

   Secondly, as a bank of deposit. To deposit money at the bank means to
   lodge it there for the sake of convenience, and to be drawn out at any
   moment the depositor pleases, or to be paid away to his order. When the
   business of discounting is great, that of depositing is necessarily

   small. No man deposits and applies for discounts at the same time; for it
   would be like paying interest for lending money, instead of for borrowing
   it.

   The deposits that are now made at the bank are almost entirely in bank
   notes, and consequently they add nothing to the ability of the bank to pay
   off the bank notes that may be presented for payment; and besides this,
   the deposits are no more the property of the bank than the cash or bank
   notes in a merchant's counting house are the property of his bookkeeper.
   No great increase therefore of bank notes, beyond what the discounting
   business admits, can be accounted for on the score of deposits.

   Thirdly, the bank acts as banker for the Government. This is the
   connection that threatens to ruin every public bank. It is through this
   connection that the credit of a bank is forced far beyond what it ought to
   be, and still further beyond its ability to pay. It is through this
   connection that such an immense redundant quantity of bank notes have
   gotten into circulation; and which, instead of being issued because there
   was property in the bank, have been issued because there was none.

   When the treasury is empty, which happens in almost every year of every
   war, its coffers at the bank are empty also. It is in this condition of
   emptiness that the minister has recourse to emissions of what are called
   exchequer and navy bills which continually generates a new increase of
   bank notes, and which are sported upon the public, without there being
   property in the bank to pay them.

   These exchequer and navy bills (being, as I have said, emitted because the
   treasury and its coffers at the bank are empty, and cannot pay the demands
   that come in) are no other than an acknowledgment that the bearer is
   entitled to receive so much money. They may be compared to the settlement
   of an account, in which the debtor acknowledges the balance he owes, and
   for which he gives a note of hand; or to a note of hand given to raise
   money upon it.

   Sometimes the bank discounts those bills as it would discount merchants'
   bills of exchange; sometimes it purchases them of the holders at the
   current price; and sometimes it agrees with the ministers to pay an
   interest upon them to the holders, and keep them in circulation. In
   everyone of these cases an additional quantity of bank notes gets into
   circulation, and are sported, as I have said, upon the public, without
   there being property in the bank, as banker for the Government, to pay
   them; and besides this, the bank has now no money of its own; for the
   money that was originally subscribed to begin the credit of the bank with,
   at its first establishment, has been lent to government and wasted long
   ago.

   "The bank" says Smith (book ii. chap. 2), "acts not only as an ordinary
   bank, but as a great engine of state; it receives and pays a greater part
   of the annuities which are due to the creditors of the public! (It is
   worth observing, that the public, or the nation, is always put for the
   Government, in speaking of debts.) "It circulates" says Smith, "exchequer
   bills, and it advances to government the annual amount of the land and
   malt taxes, which are frequently not paid till several years afterwards."
   (This advancement is also done in bank notes, for which there is not
   property in the bank.) "In those different operations" says Smith, "its
   duty to the public may sometimes have obliged it, without any fault of its
   directors, to overstock the circulation with paper money" -bank notes.

   How its duty to the public can induce it to overstock that public with
   promissory bank notes which it cannot pay, and thereby expose the
   individuals of that public to ruin, is too paradoxical to be explained;
   for it is on the credit which individuals give to the ban\\, by receiving
   and circulating its notes, and not upon its own credit or its own
   property, for it has none, that the bank sports.

   If, however, it be the duty of the bank to expose the public to this
   hazard, it is at least equally the duty of the individuals of that public
   to get their money and take care of themselves; and leave it to placemen,
   pensioners, government contractors, Reeves's Association, and the members
   of both Houses of Parliament, who have voted away the money at the nod of
   the minister, to continue the credit if they can, and for which their
   estates individually and collectively ought to answer, as far as they will
   go.

   There has always existed, and still exists, a mysterious, suspicious
   connection, between the minister and the directors of the bank, and

   which explains itself no other ways than by a continual increase in bank
   notes. Without, therefore, entering into any further details of the
   various contrivances by which bank notes are issued, and thrown upon the
   public, I proceed, as I before mentioned, to offer an estimate on the
   total quantity of bank notes in circulation.

   However disposed governments may be to wring money by taxes from the
   people, there is a limit to the practice established by the nature of
   things. That limit is the proportion between the quantity of money in a
   nation, be that quantity what it may, and the greatest quantity of taxes
   that can be raised upon it.

   People have other uses for money besides paying taxes; and it is only a
   proportional part of the money they can spare for taxes, as it is only a
   proportional part they can spare for house-rent, for clothing, or for any
   other particular use. These proportions find out and establish themselves;
   and that with such exactness, that if any one part exceeds its proportion,
   all the other parts feel it.

   Before the invention of paper money (bank notes), there was no other money
   in the nation than gold and silver, and the greatest quantity of money
   that was ever raised in taxes during that period never exceeded a fourth
   part of the quantity of money in the nation. It was high taxing when it
   came to this point. The taxes in the time of William III never reached to
   four millions before the invention of paper, and the quantity of money in
   the nation at that time was estimated to be about sixteen millions.

   The same proportions established themselves in France. There was no paper
   money in France before the present Revolution, and the taxes were
   collected in gold and silver money. The highest quantity of taxes never
   exceeded twenty-two millions sterling; and the quantity of gold and silver
   money in the nation at the same time, as stated by M. Necker, from returns
   of coinage at the mint, in his treatise on the "Administration of the
   Finances," was about ninety millions sterling. To go beyond this limit of
   a fourth part, in England, they were obliged to introduce paper money; and
   the attempt to go beyond it in France, where paper could not be
   introduced, broke up the Government. This proportion, therefore, of a
   fourth part, is the limit which the thing establishes for itself, be the
   quantity of money in a nation more or less.

   The amount of taxes in England at this time is full twenty millions; and
   therefore the quantity of gold and silver, and of bank notes, taken
   together, amounts to eighty millions. The quantity of gold and silver, as
   stated by Lord Hawkesbury's secretary, George Chalmers, as I have before
   shown, is twenty millions; and, therefore, the total amount of bank notes
   in circulation, all made payable on demand, is sixty millions. This
   enormous sum will astonish the most stupid stock-jobber, and overpower the
   credulity of the most thoughtless Englishman; but were it only a third
   part of that sum, the bank cannot pay half a crown in the pound.

   There is something curious in the movements of this modern complicated
   machine, the funding system; and it is only now that it is beginning to
   unfold the full extent of its movements. In the first part of its
   movements it gives great powers into the hands of government, and in the
   last part it takes them completely away.

   The funding system set out with raising revenues under the name of loans,
   by means of which government became both prodigal and powerful. The
   loaners assumed the name of creditors, and though it was soon discovered
   that loaning was government-jobbing, those pretended loaners, or the
   persons who purchased into the funds afterwards, conceived themselves not
   only to be creditors, but to be the only creditors.

   But such has been the operation of this complicated machine, the funding
   system, that it has produced, unperceived, a second generation of
   creditors, more numerous and far more formidable and withal more real than
   the first generation; for every holder of a bank note is a creditor, and a
   real creditor, and the debt due to him is made payable on demand. The debt
   therefore which the government owes to individuals is composed of two
   parts; the one about four hundred millions bearing interest, the other
   about sixty millions payable on demand. The one is called the funded debt,
   the other is the debt due in bank notes.

   The second debt (that contained in the bank notes) has, in a great
   measure, been incurred to pay the interest of the first debt; so that in
   fact little or no real interest has been paid by Government. The whole has
   been delusion and fraud. Government first contracted a debt, in the form
   of loans, with one class of people, and then ran clandestinely into debt
   with another class, by means of bank notes, to pay the interest.
   Government acted of itself in contracting the first debt, and made a
   machine of the bank to contract the second.

   It is this second debt that changes the seat of power and the order of
   things; for it puts it in the power of even a small part of the holders of
   bank notes (had they no other motives than disgust at Pitt and Grenville's
   sedition bills), to control any measure of government they found to be
   injurious to their interest; and that not by popular meetings, or popular
   societies, but by the simple and easy operation of withholding their
   credit from that government; that is, by individually demanding payment at
   the bank for every bank note that comes into their hands.

   Why should Pitt and Grenville expect that the very men whom they insult
   and injure should, at the same time, continue to support the measures of
   Pitt and Grenville by giving credit to their promissory notes of payment?
   No new emissions of bank notes could go on while payment was demanding on
   the old, and the cash in the bank wasting daily away; nor any new advances
   be made to Government, or to the Emperor, to carry on the war; nor any new
   emission be made on exchequer bills.

   "The bank" says Smith (book ii. chap. 2), "is a great engine of State."
   And in the same paragraph he says, "The stability of the bank is equal to
   that of the British Government"; which is the same as to say that the
   stability of the Government is equal to that of the bank, and

   no more. If then the bank cannot pay, the arch-treasurer of the Holy Roman
   Empire (S. R. I. A.) (Part of the inscription on an English
   guinea.-Author.) is a bankrupt. When folly invented titles, she did not
   attend to their application; for ever since the Government of England has
   been in the hands of arch-treasurers, it has been running into bankruptcy;
   and as to the arch-treasurer apparent, he has been a bankrupt long ago.
   What a miserable prospect has England before its eyes!

   Before the War of 1755 there were no bank notes lower than -L-20. During
   that war, bank notes of -L-15 and of -L-10 were coined; and now, since the
   commencement of the present war, they are coined as low as -L-5 . These
   -L-5 notes will circulate chiefly among little shop-keepers, butchers,
   bakers, market-people, renters of small houses, lodgers, etc.

   All the high departments of commerce and the affluent stations of life
   were already overstocked, as Smith expresses it, with the bank notes. No
   place remained open wherein to crowd an additional quantity of bank notes
   but among the class of people I have just mentioned, and the means of
   doing this could be best effected by coining -L-5 notes. This conduct has
   the appearance of that of an unprincipled insolvent, who, when on the
   verge of bankruptcy to the amount of many thousands, will borrow as low as
   -L-5 of the servants in his house, and break the next day.

   But whatever momentary relief or aid the minister and his bank might
   expect from this low contrivance of -L-5 notes, it will increase the
   inability of the bank to pay the higher notes, and hasten the destruction
   of all; for even the small taxes that used to be paid in money will now be
   paid in those notes, and the bank will soon find itself with scarcely any
   other money than what the hair-powder guinea-tax brings in.

   The bank notes make the most serious part of the business of finance: what
   is called the national funded debt is but a trifle when put in comparison
   with it; yet the case of the bank notes has never been touched upon. But
   it certainly ought to be known upon what authority, whether that of the
   minister or of the directors, and upon what foundation, such immense
   quantities are issued. I have stated the amount of them at sixty millions;
   I have produced data for that estimation; and besides this, the apparent
   quantity of them, far beyond that of gold and silver in the nation,
   corroborates the statement. But were there but a third part of sixty
   millions, the bank cannot pay half a crown in the pound; for no new supply
   of money, as before said, can arrive at the bank, as all the taxes will be
   paid in paper.

   When the funding system began it was not doubted that the loans that had
   been borrowed would be repaid. Government not only propagated that belief,
   but it began paying them off. In time this profession came to be
   abandoned: and it is not difficult to see that bank notes will march the
   same way; for the amount of them is only another debt under another name;
   and the probability is that Mr. Pitt will at last propose funding them. In
   that case bank notes will not be so valuable as French assignats.

   The assignats have a solid property in reserve, in the national domains;
   bank notes have none; and, besides this, the English revenue must then
   sink down to what the amount of it was before the funding system
   began-between three and four millions; one of which the arch-treasurer
   would require for himself, and the arch-treasurer apparent would require
   three-quarters of a million more to pay his debts. "In France," says
   Sterne, "they order these things better!'

   I have now exposed the English system of finance to the eyes of all
   nations; for this work will be published in all languages. In doing this,
   I have done an act of justice to those numerous citizens of neutral
   nations who have been imposed upon by that fraudulent system, and who have
   property at stake upon the event.

   As an individual citizen of America, and as far as an individual can go, I
   have revenged (if I may use the expression without any immoral meaning)
   the piratical depredations committed on American commerce by the English
   Government. I have retaliated for France on the subject of finance: and I
   conclude with retorting on Mr. Pitt the expression h used against France,
   and say, that the English system of finance "IS ON THE VERGE, NAY EVEN IN
   THE GULF OF BANKRUPTCY."

   Paris, nineteenth Germinal, fourth year of the Republic, April 8, 1796.

   Among the delusions that have been imposed upon the nation by ministers to
   give a false coloring to its affairs, and by none more than by Mr. Pitt,
   is a motley, amphibious- charactered thing called the balance of trade.
   This balance of trade, as it is called, is taken from the custom-house
   books, in which entries are made of all cargoes exported, and also of all
   cargoes imported, in each year; and when the value of the exports,
   according to the price set upon them by the exporter or by the
   custom-house, is greater than the value of the imports, estimated in the
   same manner, they say the balance of trade is much in their favor.

   The custom-house books prove regularly enough that so many cargoes have
   been exported, and so many imported; but this is all that they prove, or
   were intended to prove, They have nothing to do with the balance of profit
   or loss; and it is ignorance to appeal.

   The custom-house books prove regularly enough that so many cargoes have
   been exported, and so many imported; but this is all that they prove, or
   were intended to prove, They have nothing to do with the balance of profit
   or loss; and it is ignorance to appeal to them upon that account; for the
   case is, that the greater the loss is in any one year, the higher will
   this thing called the balance of trade appear to be according to tie
   custom-house books.

   For example, nearly the whole of the Mediterranean convoy has been taken
   by the Frerich this year; consequently those cargoes will not appear as
   imports on the custom- house books, and therefore the balance of trade, by
   which they mean the profits of it, will appear to be so much the greater
   as the loss amounts to; and, on the other hand, had the loss not happened,
   the profits would have appeared to have been so much the less. All the
   losses happening at sea to returning cargoes, by accidents, by the
   elements, or by capture, make the balance appear the higher on the side of
   the exports; and were they all lost at sea, it would appear to be all
   profit on the custom-house books.

   Also every cargo of exports that is lost that occasions another to be
   sent, adds in like manner to the side of the exports, and appears as
   profit. This year the balance of trade will appear high, because the
   losses have been great by capture and by storms. The ignorance of the
   British Parliament in listening to this hackneyed imposition of ministers
   about the balance of trade is astonishing. It shows how little they know
   of national affairs- and Mr. Grey may as well talk Greek to them, as to
   make motions about the state of the nation. They understand only
   fox-hunting and the game laws.
