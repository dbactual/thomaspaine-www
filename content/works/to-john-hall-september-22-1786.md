   To John Hall  September 22, 1786

   BORDENTOWN,

   OLD FRIEND :

   In the first place I have settled with Mr. Gordon for the time he has been
   in the house-in the second I have put Mrs. Read who, you know has part of
   our house Col. Kirkbride's but is at this time at Lancaster, in possession
   by putting part of her goods in it. By this means we shall have room at
   our house (Col. Kirkbride) for carrying on our operations. As Philadelphia
   is so injurious to your health and as apartments at Wm. Foulke's would not
   be convenient to you, we can now conveniently make room for you here. Mrs.
   Kirkbride mentioned this to me herself and it is by the choice of both her
   and Col. K. that I write it to you. I wish you could come up to-morrow
   (Sunday) and bring the iron with you. I shall be backward and forward
   between here and Philadelphia pretty often until the elections are over,
   but we can make a beginning here and what more iron we may want we can get
   at the Delaware Works, and if you should want to go to Mount Hope you can
   more conveniently go from here than from Philadelphia-thus you see I have
   done your business since I have been up. The enclosed letter is for Mr.
   Henry who is member for Lancaster County. I do not know where he lodges,
   but if William will be so good as to give it to the door keeper or Clerk
   of the Assembly it will be safe. Bring up the walnut strips with you. Your
   coming here will give an opportunity to Joseph to get acquainted with Col.
   K. who will very freely give any information in his power. Compliments in
   the family.

   Your friend and Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
