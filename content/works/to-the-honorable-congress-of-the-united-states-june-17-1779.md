   To the Honorable Congress of the United States  June 17, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   On the 25th ult., I addressed a letter to this Honorable House (being my
   second on the same subject) requesting copies of Mr. Deane's Narrative and
   subsequent letters to Congress so far as they relate to me, which request
   has not been complied with. I have a right, and do hereby complain of and
   charge this House with injustice, in withholding from me, such parts of
   the said Narrative and letters; and find myself obliged to intimate to
   Congress that as I cannot consider my services to the United States
   inferior to that of any gentleman in his House, so I find it impossible in
   me to put up any longer with such treatment.

   I have not been a servant for the sake of hire, or a friend from the
   expectation of reward. I have done what I conceived to be my duty in the
   worst of times, and shall continue to do so, regardless of the favor or
   disfavor of this House, or any of its members on one side or the other. I
   am sensible that I have deserved the former but if I cannot have it on
   fair and open grounds I prefer the latter.

   I observe by the Journals of the 26th ult., that on the reading of my
   letter of the 25th, a motion was made for committing it together with my
   former letters on that subject and to enquire of me, etc., etc. I consider
   myself obliged to the gentlemen who moved and voted for the committing,
   and am quite at a loss to understand the conduct of those who negatived
   it. The motion whatever might be its design has a good appearance, and the
   compliance of the House therewith would have tended to establish a point
   which has hitherto been much controverted, namely, whether an extensive
   trading company had not been formed between Mr. Deane and certain members
   of Congress. A gentleman was then in town, who was present at the
   examination of two members of Congress-on that subject, was possessed of
   the questions and answers in writing, and had communicated the substance
   of them to me. He is a Col in the Virginia line, and had sat twelve years
   a member in the former assemblies of that State.

   I am Honorable Sirs, Your Obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   (The motion, Paine refers to, reads: " T h a t Mr. Paine's letter of this
   day, together with his formal letters on the same subject, be referred to
   a committee, and that the committee be directed to enquire whether Mr.
   Paine has any other and what evidence against Mr. Deane, than what is now
   before Congress, and that they report especially and particularly thereon,
   with all convenient speed." Ford, op. cit., vol. XIV, p. 646.-Editor.)
