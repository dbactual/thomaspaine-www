   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Paris March 17, 1802

   Dear Sir

   I wrote to you while Mr. Dawson was here that I would wait the arrival of
   the Trysie that was to bring Mr. Livingston, and return by it to America,
   in preference to the Maryland which you offered me, but the frigate being
   ordered to the Mediterranean prevented me that opportunity. As it is now
   Peace, though the definitive Treaty is not yet signed, I shall set off by
   the first opportunity from Havre or Dieppe after the Equinoxial gales are
   over.

   Your discourse to Congress has drawn a great deal of attention both here
   and in England, and has been printed in a Pamphlet in both Countries, that
   in France with a french French translation annext. I sent some Copies to a very
   intimate and old acquaintance of mine and also an acquaintance of Mr.
   Monroe, Sir Robert Smyth, and I transcribe to you an extract from his
   answer by which you will see the opinion the Patriots form of it on this
   side the Water.

   "With respect to Mr. Jefferson's speech it is a master-piece of simple and
   unaffected Eloquence, and of clear honest political statement. There is no
   State Paper, except the celebrated one of Count Bernstoff of Denmark upon
   the french revolution to be compared with it. It confirms the opinion I
   always had of Mr. Jefferson, and I always Lamented that my return to
   England in 1787, to attend Parliament, prevented my cultivating his
   acquaintance. I had then an excellent opportunity from my residing at
   Challiot and sometimes visiting Dr. Franklin who lived at Passy very near
   me, and Mr. Jefferson took the beautiful Villa at the Barriere where I
   once saw him in company with Mr. Humphries, Mr. Smith and some other
   American Gentlemen. - It is certainly a curious Phenomenon to hear the
   Executive magistrate complain of having too much power and too much
   revenue. The Tories in England say the king has neither Revenue nor
   Power enough to govern with effect, although the management of the public
   revenue, the prerogative of the Crown, and the influence he has over
   Parliament render him all Powerful."

   I have introduced an acquaintance between Mr. Livingston and Sir R. which
   is become very agreeable to both, as they are men of the same habits and
   the same principles.

   The negotiations at Amiens still hangs in the wind, what the impediments
   are I do not know. But viewing the matter in mass I can find no
   disposition to believe that the negociation will be broken off, and
   hostilities renewed. There appears to me no object to justify such a
   measure in the opinion of thinking men in either Country, especially after
   the first difficulties are gotten over, that of signing the Preliminaries.
   I suppose the embarrassment, if there is any, may be guessed at, by
   supposing a truce between two armies in which one complains that the other
   has altered his position during the truce.

   I see that the dispute with Tripoly still remains unsettled. I will throw
   out an Idea upon this subject. There are but few places in Europe where
   ministers from America can be of much use. But I think if one could be
   sent and well received at Constantinople it would be of considerable
   advantage towards the security of our Commerce in the Mediterranean. The
   Porte has on account of its religion, considerable influence over the
   Barbary States and those States would, I think, be much checked in their
   avidity and insolence for war with us, if we were on a good standing at
   Constantinople.

   A Daughter of Sir Robert Smyth is married to an intimate friend of mine,
   Mr. Este, a young man of promising abilities, great industry, and
   considerable acquired property. Sir Robert has brought him forward by
   establishing a banking house at Paris under the firm of Sir R. Smyth and
   Company, and I see the business done at it will be great. I recollect that
   Mr. Le Grand, an acquaintance of Doctor Franklin was a Banker for the
   United States during the American war. He is since dead, and the concerns
   for the United States have since that been done at Amsterdam; But as you
   have now no Minister there, you may find it convenient to remove it again
   to Paris, in which case you cannot place it or some part of it better than
   in the house I am speaking of, but I will talk more about this when I have
   the happiness of seeing you which I hope will be soon after your receipt
   of this letter. I continue in excellent health, which I know your
   friendship will be glad to hear of.

   Wishing you and America every happiness I remain 
   
   your former fellow Laborer and much obliged fellow Citizen
