   To Thomas Jefferson Dec 25, 1802

   SENT TO THE PRESIDENT, CHRISTMAS DAY , 1802.

   [DEAR SIR:]

   Spain has ceded Louisiana to France, and France has excluded Americans
   from New Orleans, and the navigation of the Mississippi. The people of the
   Western Territory have complained of it to their Government, and the
   Government is of consequence involved and interested in the affair. The
   question then is-What is the best step to be taken? 1

   The one is to begin by memorial and remonstrance against an infraction of
   a right. The other is by accommodation-still keeping the right in view,
   but not making it a ground-work.

   Suppose then the Government begin by making a proposal to France to
   repurchase the cession made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it be
   with the consent of the people of Louisiana, or a majority thereof.

   By beginning on this ground anything can be said without carrying the
   appearance of a threat. The growing power of the Western Territory can be
   stated as a matter of information, and also the impossibility of
   restraining them from seizing upon New Orleans, and the equal
   impossibility of France to prevent it.

   Suppose the proposal attended to, the sum to be given comes next on the
   carpet. This, on the part of America, will be estimated between the value
   of the commerce and the quantity of revenue that Louisiana will produce.

   The French treasury is not only empty, but the Government has consumed by
   anticipation a great part of the next year's revenue. A monied proposal
   will, I believe, be attended to; if it should, the claims upon France can
   be stipulated as part of the payment, and that sum can be paid here to the
   claimants.

   I congratulate you on The Birthday of the New Sun, now called Christmas
   Day; and I make you a present of a thought on Louisiana.

   T. P.

   1. By the Treaty of San Ildetonso, October 1, 1800, and the Convention of
   Aranjuez, March 21, 1801, Napoleon acquired Louisiana from Spain in return
   for placing the Prince of Parma, son-in-law of the Spanish king, on the
   newly-erected throne of Etruria. By the Treaty of San Lorenzo, Spain, in
   1795, had granted American citizens the privilege of depositing their
   goods at New Orleans for reshipment in ocean-going vessels. On October 16,
   1802 Juan Ventura Morales, the acting intendant of Louisiana, revoked this
   right of deposit and failed to provide another site, as the treaty
   required. It was assumed in America at this time that France was
   responsible for the revocation, but all available evidence indicates that
   the action was taken by Spain alone. The day after receiving this letter,
   Jefferson told Paine that "measures were already taken in that
   business."-Editor.
