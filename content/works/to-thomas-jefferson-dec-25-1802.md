   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Of Louisiana

   Spain has ceded Louisiana to france and france has excluded Americans
   from N. Orleans and the Navigation of the Mississippi - the people of the
   western territory have complained of it to their government, and the
   governt. is of consequence involved and interested in the affair. The
   question then is, What is the best step to be taken first.

   The one is to begin by memorial and remonstrance against an infraction of
   a right. The other is by accommodation, still keeping the right in view,
   but not making it a ground-work -

   Suppose then the Governt. begin by making a proposal to france to
   repurchase the Cession made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it be
   *with the consent of the people of Louisiana, or a Majority thereof*.

   By beginning on this ground any thing can be said without carrying the
   appearance of a threat - the growing power of the western territory can be
   stated as matter of information, and also the impossibility of
   restraining them from seizing upon New Orleans and the equal
   impossibility of france to prevent it.

   Suppose the proposal attended to, the sum to be given comes next on the
   Carpet. This, on the part of America will be estimated between the Value
   of the Commerce and the quantity of revenue that Louisiana will produce.

   The french treasury is not only empty but the Government has consumed by
   anticipation a great part of the next year's revenue. A Monied proposal
   will, I believe, be attended to; if it should, the claims upon france can
   be stipulated as part of the payment, and that sum can be paid here to the
   claimants. -

   I congratulate you on the *birth day of the New Sun*, now called Christmas
   day; and I make you a present of a thought on Louisiana.

   T. P -
