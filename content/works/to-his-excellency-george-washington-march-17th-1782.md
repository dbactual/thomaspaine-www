   To his Excellency George Washington  March 17th, 1782

   PHILADELPHIA,

   SIR:

   You will do me a great deal of pleasure if you can make it convenient to
   yourself to spend part of an Evening at my apartment and eat a few oysters
   or a crust of bread and cheese; for besides the favor you will dome, I
   want much to consult with you on a matter of public business though of a
   secret nature, which I have already mentioned to Mr. Morris, whom I
   likewise intend to ask, as soon as yourself shall please to mention the
   Evening when.

   Though it is impossible to find out what the British will do by finding
   what they ought to do, yet I have been turning over in my mind the
   circumstances connected with the probable evacuation of Charleston in
   order to come at their line of policy on that measure, and as it is a
   rainy morning, with no inducement to go out, and I am sitting as before I
   will take the liberty of communicating them to you.

   The foundation of the measure as well as the present general opinion is
   that if they cannot reinforce they must evacuate.

   2dly That being a ministerial post, Gen. Clinton must wait either for
   positive or discretionary orders.

   3rdly, That as it is now a losing game (I am much inclined to believe),
   the Ministry will only give discretionary orders.

   4thly, That as Clinton sees the Ministry are pushing the matter off their
   own shoulders on him, he has likewise pushed it from himself upon a
   Council of war, and this I take to have been the subject of debate, and
   not whether N[ew] York or Charleston should be evacuated as mentioned in
   General Heath's information.

   5thly. That order to prepare for evacuation have been sent, and probably
   have been accompanied with instructions not to do it till further orders,
   unless the commanding officer at Charleston sees necessity.

   6thly. But while these matters were acting a new circumstance has arisen,
   not at that time known, which is the miscarriage of Count de Guichon
   (whose sailing, probably produced in a principal degree, the discretionary
   instructions from the Ministry) and the sailing of Admiral Rodney by which
   he will be first in the West Indies. 103 And as Charleston from these two
   events will be safe for a longer time, I think it is probable that the
   evacuation will be delayed.

   Now all this reasoning may be wrong, because they are without reasons.

   I am your Excellency's Obligated and Obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
