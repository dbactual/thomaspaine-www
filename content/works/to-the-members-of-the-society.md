   The New York Gazette of the sixteenth (August) contains the following
   article-"On Tuesday, a committee of the Missionary Society, consisting
   chiefly of distinguished Clergymen, had an interview, at the City Hotel,
   with the chiefs of the Osage tribe of Indians, now in this city (New York)
   to whom they presented a Bible, together with an address, the object of
   which was to inform them that this good book contained the will and laws
   of the GREAT SPIRIT."

   It is to be hoped some humane person will, on account of our people on the
   frontiers, as well as of the Indians, undeceive them with respect to the
   present the missionaries have made them, and which they call a good book,
   containing, they say, the will and laws of the GREAT SPIRIT. Can those
   missionaries suppose that the assassination of men, women and children,
   and sucking infants, related in the books ascribed to Moses, Joshua, etc.,
   and blasphemously said to be done by the command of the Lord, the Great
   Spirit, can be edifying to our Indian neighbors, or advantageous to us?

   Is not the Bible warfare the same kind of warfare as the Indians
   themselves carry on, that of indiscriminate destruction, and against which
   humanity shudders? Can the horrid examples and vulgar obscenity with which
   the Bible abounds improve the morals or civilize the manners of the
   Indians? Will they learn sobriety and decency from drunken Noah and
   beastly Lot; or will their daughters be edified by the example of Lot's
   daughters?

   Will the prisoners they take in war be treated the better by their knowing
   the horrid story of Samuel's hewing Agag in pieces like a block of wood,
   or David's putting them under harrows of iron?

   Will not the shocking accounts of the destruction of the Canaanites, when
   the Israelites invaded their country, suggest the idea that we may serve
   them in the same manner, or the accounts stir them up to do the like to
   our people on the frontiers, and then justify the assassination by the
   Bible the missionaries have given them? Will those missionary societies
   never leave off doing mischief?

   In the accounts which this missionary committee give of their interview,
   they make the chief of the Indians to say, that, "as neither he nor his
   people could read it, he begged that some good white man might be sent to
   instruct them."

   It is necessary the general Government keep a strict eye over those
   missionary societies, who, under the pretense of instructing the Indians,
   send spies into their country to find out the best lands. No society
   should be permitted to have intercourse with the Indian tribes, nor send
   any person among them, but with the knowledge and consent of the
   Government.

   The present Administration has brought the Indians into a
   good disposition, and is improving them in the moral and civil comforts of
   life; but if these self-created societies be suffered to interfere, and
   send their speculating missionaries among them, the laudable object of
   government will be defeated. Priests, we know, are not remarkable for
   doing anything gratis; they have in general some scheme in everything they
   do, either to impose on the ignorant, or derange the operations of
   government.
