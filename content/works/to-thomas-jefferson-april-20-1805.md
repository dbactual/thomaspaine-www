   To Thomas Jefferson  [April 20, 1805]1

   DEAR SIR:

   I will first give you an account of my own operations and then pass on to
   such other matters as may occur.

   I am settled down on my farm at New Rochelle, twenty miles from N[ew]
   York. It is a pleasant and healthy situation commanding a prospect always
   green and agreeable as New Rochelle produces a great deal of grass and
   hay. The farm contains three hundred acres, about one hundred of which is
   meadow land, one hundred grazing and tillage land, and the remainder wood
   land. It is an oblong about a mile and a half in length. I have sold off
   sixty one acres and an half for four thousand and twenty dollars. With
   this money I shall improve the other part, and build an addition 34 feet
   by 32 to the present dwelling house which is small. The additional part
   will be one room high from the ground (about 11 or 12 feet) divided into
   apartments with a work- shop for my mechanical operations. The upper part
   of this will be flat as the deck of a ship is, with a little slope to
   carry off the rain. It will be enclosed with a palisade all round, and
   covered with arched rafters shingled as the roof of a house is, down to
   within about 7 feet of the deck or floor. This part will then serve for an
   observatory and to live on in summer weather, and with screens, or light
   shrubs in light cases on casters to move easily I can set off what rooms I
   like in any part, alter them and choose, and be as retired in the open air
   as I please. The roof of my kitchen is decayed and must be taken down, and
   I intend putting a semicircular roof over it, by which means that which is
   now the garret, in which you can scarcely stand right up but in the
   middle, will then be spacious and commodious; and I have an idea that
   appears to me well founded, that a garret with an arched roof will not be
   hot in the summer like one covered with a roof on straight rafters,
   because the sun's rays striking on an arched roof will be thrown off on a
   similar principle that in a concave they are concentrated ; but a straight
   raftered roof presents almost a right angled surface to the sun's rays and
   the heat of them passes through. I have observed that the round metal
   globe or ball on the top of andirons does not retain heat. The present
   form

   to the eye and nothing can make them otherwise; but an arched roof will be
   an ornament without and commodious within, and support itself better than
   a straight raftered roof. This is my opinion but experience must decide.

   This figure [see preceding page (OMITTED)] shows the different capacities
   between an arched roof and a straight raftered roof. If the perpendicular
   to a represents a man's height, he cannot stand up right under a straight
   roof but between the lines b and b. In the arched roof all the way from a
   to a. The diagonal line c represents a ray of the sun striking at right
   angles on a straight raftered roof. The heat of it must either be
   reflected back on the ray or pass through the roof. The arched roof will,
   I think, have a disposition to scatter them. I have made a model in
   pasteboard of an arched roof on a base 32 inches (half an inch to a foot)
   which equals my expectations. It shows the method of forming arch rafters,
   which may be done two ways. One, by using narrow boards edgeways cut into
   short pieces in the direction of the radius and of two or three thickness
   to break joints. This is on the principle of the dome over the corn market
   at Paris adapted to a square building, and I wonder they should not have
   thought of applying it; but they began with a dome and they left off as if
   it was applicable to no other figure. The second figure in the margin
   represents a narrow board cut in the direction of the radius. The piece
   cut off serves as a pattern for cutting all the pieces which when put
   together form a polygon the corner of which may be sawed or chiseled off.

   The other method of making arched rafters is to bend a board flatways to
   the curve that is wanted then bend another board over it and nail them
   together. They will then keep that curve, because the upper board being a
   portion of a larger circle than the under one, the two confine each other
   to the curve. The thickness may be increased at pleasure. This method is
   expeditious. I shall roof my kitchen in this method and the new part by
   the same method.

   1. Commenting upon Paine's arrangement of his home, Jefferson wrote, in a
   letter to Paine, June 5, 1805: "I much doubt whether the open room on your
   second story will answer your expectations. There will be a few days in
   the year in which it will be delightful, but not many. Nothing but trees,
   or Venetian blinds, can protect it from the sun. The semi-cylindrical roof
   you propose will have advantages. You know it has been practised on the
   cloth market at Paris. De Lorme, the inventor, shows many forms of roofs
   in his book towhich it is applicable, I have used it at home for a dome,
   being one hundred and twenty degrees of an oblong octagon, and in the
   capitol we unite two quadrants of a sphere by a semi-cylinder; all framed
   in De Lorme's manner. . . ."
