   From the copy of the letter at the Library of Congress.

   Borden Town Sept 21, 1783.

   Sir,

   I am made exceedingly happy, by the receipt of your friendly letter of the
   10th inst. which is this moment come to hand; and the young gentleman
   that brought it, a son of Col. Geo. Morgan's waits while I write this &mdash; It
   hath been sent to Philadelphia, and on my not being there, was returned,
   agreeable to directions on the outside, to Col. Morgan at Princetown, who
   forwarded it to this place.

   I most sincerely thank you for your good wishes and friendship to me, and
   the kind invitation you have honored me with, which I shall with much
   pleasure accept.

   On the resignation of Mr. Livingston in the winter and likewise of Mr. R.
   Morris, at time it was judged proper to discontinue the matter
   which took place when you were in Philadelphia. It was at the same time a
   pleasure to me to find both these gentlemen (to whom I was before that time 
   but little known) so warmly disposed to assist in
   rendering my situation permanent, and Mr. Livingston's letter to me, in
   answer to one of mine to him, which I enclose, will serve to show that his
   friendship to me is in concurrence with yours.

   By the advice of Mr. Morris I presented a letter to Congress expressing a
   request that they would be pleased to direct me to lay before them, an
   account of what my services such as they were, situations, have been
   during the course of the war. This letter was referred to a committee, 
   their report is now before Congress, and contains, as I am informed a
   recommendation that I be appointed historiographer to the Continent. I
   have desired some members that the further consideration of it be
   postponed, until I can state to the committee some matters which I wish
   them to be acquainted with, both with regard to myself and the
   appointment. And as it was my intention, so I am now encouraged by your
   friendship to take your confidential advice upon it before I present it.
   For though I was never at a loss in writing on public matters I feel
   exceedingly so in what respects myself.

   I am hurt by the neglect of the collective ostensible body of America, in
   a way which it is probable they do not perceive my feelings. It has an
   effect in putting either my reputation or their generosity at stake, for
   it cannot fail of suggesting that either I, (notwithstanding the appearance
   of service) have been undeserving their regard or that they are remiss
   towards me. Their silence is to me something like condemnation, and their
   neglect must be justified by my loss of reputation, or my reputation
   supported at their injury; either of which is alike painful to me. But as
   I have ever been dumb on everything which might touch national honor so I
   mean ever to continue so.

   Wishing you, Sir, the happy enjoyment of peace and every public and 
   private felicity I remain, Your Excellancy's most obt & hmble servt

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Col. Kirkbride at whose house I am, desires me to present you his
   respectful compliments.
