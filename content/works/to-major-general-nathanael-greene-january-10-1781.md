   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.
   
   Jany. 10th 1781

   M. Dear Sir

   I have put off the writing of this letter to the last minute lest I should
   be disappointed by any unexpected Circumstance in the journey and voyage I
   am undertaking &mdash; I received your very friendly and affectionate letter from
   Annapolis for which I thank you &mdash; I followed the advice of it and that with
   the more readiness as it was the advice too of several of my best and
   warmest friends &mdash; Since which Congress have appointed Col Laurens Envoy
   Extraordinary to France, and I shall accompany him there a Secretary &mdash; I
   am desirous of giving you this information because no endeavor of mine
   so far as they extend will be wanting to show the necessity of a
   reenforcement of *cash* to the Continent and Troops to the Southward.

   I leave America with the perfect satisfaction of having been to her an
   honest faithful and affectionate friend, and I go away with the hope of
   returning to spend better or more agreeable days with her than those which
   are past.

   God bless and prosper you

   Yours Sincerely,

   T. PAINE
