   CONSTRUCTING ARCHES, VAULTED ROOFS, AND CEILINGS

   TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, I, THOMAS PAINE, send greeting.

   WHEREAS, His Most Excellent Majesty King George III, by his letters patent
   under the Great Seal of Great Britain, bearing date the twenty-sixth day
   of August, in the twenty-eighth year of his reign, did give unto me, the
   said Thomas Paine, his special license that I, the said Thomas Paine,
   during the term of fourteen years therein expressed, should and lawfully
   might make, use, exercise, and vend, within England, Wales, and Town of
   Berwick-upon-Tweed, my invention of "A METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING ARCHES,
   VAULTED ROOFS, AND CEILINGS, EITHER IN IRON OR WOOD, ON PRINCIPLES N E W
   AND DIFFERENT TO ANYTHING HITHERTO PRACTISED, BY MEANS OF WHICH
   CONSTRUCTION, ARCHES, VAULTED ROOFS, AND CEILINGS MAY BE ERECTED TO THE
   EXTENT OF SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BEYOND WHAT CAN BE PERFORMED IN THE
   PRESENT PRACTISE OF ARCHITECTURE; "in which said letters patent there is
   contained a proviso obliging me, the said Thomas Paine, to cause a
   particular description of the nature of my said invention, and in what
   manner the same is to be performed, by an instrument in writing under my
   hand and seal, to be enrolled in His Majesty's High Court of Chancery
   within one calendar month next and immediately after the date of the said
   recited letters patent, as in and by the same (relation being thereunto
   had) may more fully and at large appear.

   Now KNOW YE, that in compliance with the said proviso, I, the said Thomas
   Paine, do hereby declare that my said invention of A Method of
   Constructing of Arches, Vaulted Roofs, and Ceilings, either in Iron or
   Wood, on Principles New and Different to anything hitherto practised by
   means of which Construction, Arches, Vaulted Roofs, and Ceilings may be
   Erected to the Extent of several Hundred Feet beyond what can be performed
   in the present practise of Architecture, is described in manner following
   (that is to say) :-

   The idea and construction of this arch is taken from the figure of a
   spider's circular web, of which it resembles a section, and from a
   conviction that when nature empowered this insect to make a web she also
   instructed her in the strongest mechanical method of constructing it.

   Another idea, taken from nature in the construction of this arch, is that
   of increasing the strength of matter by dividing and combining it, and
   thereby causing it to act over a larger space than it would occupy in a
   solid state, as is seen in the quills of birds, bones of animals, reeds,
   canes, etc. The curved bars of the arch are composed of pieces of any
   length joined together to the whole extent of the arch, and take curvature
   by bending.

   Those curves, to any number, height or thickness, as the extent of the
   arch may require, are raised concentrically one above another, and
   separated, when the extent of the arch requires it, by the interposition
   of blocks, tubes, or pins, and the whole bolted close and fast together
   (the direction of the radius is the best) through the whole thickness of
   the arch, the bolts being made fast by a head pin or screw at each end of
   them. This connection forms one arched rib, and the number of ribs to be
   used is in proportion to the breadth and extent of the arch, and those
   separate ribs are also combined and braced together by bars passing across
   all the ribs, and made fast thereto above and below, and as often and
   wherever the arch, from its extent, depth, and breadth, requires. When
   this arch is to be applied to the purpose of a bridge, which requires more
   arches than one, they are to be connected in the following manner (this is
   to say):

   Wood piles are to be driven into the earth; over each of those piles are
   to be let fall a hollow iron or metal case, with a broad foot let into a
   bed; the interspace between the case and the wood pile to be filled up
   with a cement and pinned together. The whole number of those pillars are
   to be braced together, and formed into a platform for receiving and
   connecting the arches. The inter spaces of those pillars may be filled
   with plates of iron or lattice work so as to resemble a pier, or left open
    - so as to resemble a colonnade of any of the orders of architecture.

   Among the advantages of this construction is that of rendering the
   construction of bridges into a portable manufacture, as the bars and parts
   of which it is composed need not be longer or larger than is convenient to
   be stowed in a vessel, boat, or wagon, and that with as much compactness
   as iron or timber is transported to or from Great Britain; and a bridge of
   any extent upon this construction may be manufactured in Great Britain and
   sent to any part of the world to be erected. For the purpose of preserving
   the iron from rust it is to be varnished over with a coat of melted glass.
   It ought to be observed that extreme simplicity, though striking to the
   view, is difficult to be conceived from description, although such
   description exactly accords, upon inspection, with the thing described.

   A practicable method of constructing arches to several hundred feet span,
   with a small elevation, is the desideratum of bridge architecture, and it
   is the principle and practicability of constructing and connecting such
   arches so as totally to remove or effectually lessen the danger and
   inconvenience of obstructing the channel of rivers, together with that of
   adding a new and important manufacture to the iron works of the nation,
   capable of transportation and exportation, that is herein described. When
   this arch is to be applied to the purpose of a roof and ceiling cords may
   be added to the arch to supply the want of butments, which are to be
   braced to or connected with the arch by perpendiculars.

   In witness whereof, I, the said Thomas Paine, have hereunto set my hand
   and seal, the twenty-fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord one
   thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight.

   THOMAS (L.S.) PAINE.

   Sealed and delivered, being first duly stamped, in the presence of PETER
   WHITESIDE.

   that on the twenty-fifth day of September, in AND BE IT REMEMBERED, the
   twenty-eighth year of the reign of His Majesty, King George, III, the said
   Thomas Paine came before our said Lord the King in His Chancery, and
   acknowledged the instrument aforesaid,, and all and everything therein
   contained and specified, in form above written. And also the instrument
   aforesaid was stamped according to the tenor of the several statutes made
   in the sixth year of the reign of the late King and Queen, William and
   Mary of England, and so forth, and in the seventeenth and twenty-third
   years of the reign of His Majesty King George III.

   Enrolled the said twenty-fifth day of September, in the year last above
   written.
