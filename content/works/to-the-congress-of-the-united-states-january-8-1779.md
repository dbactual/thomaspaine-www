   To the Congress of the United States  January 8, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS :

   Finding by the Journals of this House, 45 of yesterday, that I am not to
   be heard, and having in my letter of the same day, prior to that
   resolution, declared that I could not "in duty to my character as a
   freeman submit to be censured unheard," therefore, consistent with that
   declaration, and to maintain that right, I think it my duty to resign the
   office of Secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs, and I do hereby
   resign the same. The papers and documents in my charge I shall faithfully
   deliver up to the Committee, either on honor or oath, as they or this
   House shall direct.

   Considering myself now no longer a servant of Congress, I conceive it
   convenient that I should declare what have been the motives of my conduct.
   On the appearance of Mr. Deane's address to the public of the 5 of Dec, in
   which he said "The ears of the Representatives were shut against him," the
   honor and justice of this House were impeached and its reputation sunk to
   the lowest ebb in the opinion of the people. The expressions of suspicion
   and degradation which have been uttered in my hearing and are too indecent
   to be related in this letter, first induced me to set the public right;
   but so grounded were they almost without exception, in their ill opinion
   of this House, that instead of succeeding as I wished in my first address,
   I fell under the same reproach and was frequently told that I was
   defending Congress in their bad designs. This obliged me to go farther
   into the matters, and I have now reason to believe that my endeavors have
   been and will be effectual.

   My wish and my intentions in all my late publications were to preserve the
   public from error and imposition, to support as far as laid in my power
   the just authority of the Representatives of the people, and to
   cordiallize and cement the union that has so happily taken place between
   this country and France.

   I have betrayed no trust because I have constantly employed that trust to
   the public good. I have revealed no secrets because I have told nothing
   that was, or I conceive ought to be a secret. I have convicted Mr. Deane
   of error, and in so doing I hope I have done my duty.

   It is to the interest of the Alliance that the people should know that
   before America had any agent in Europe the "public-spirited gentlemen" in
   that quarter of the world were her warm friends. And I hope this honorable
   House will receive it from me as a farther testimony of my affection to
   that Alliance, and of my attention to the duty of my office, that I
   mention, that the duplicates of the Dispatches of Oct. 6 and 7, 1777, from
   the Commissioners, the originals of which are in the Enemy's possession,
   seem to require on that account a reconsideration.

   His Excellency, the Minister of France, is well acquainted with the
   liberality of my sentiments, and I have had the pleasure of receiving
   repeated testimonies of his esteem for me. I am concerned that he should
   in any instance misconceive me. I beg likewise to have it understood that
   my appeal to this honorable House for a hearing yesterday was as a matter
   of right in the character of a freeman, which right I ought to yield up to
   no power whatever. I return my utmost thanks to the honorable Members of
   this House who endeavored to support me in that right, so sacred to
   themselves and to their constituents; and I have the pleasure of saying
   and reflecting that as I came into office an honest man, I go out of it
   with the same character.

   I am, Honorable Sirs, your honors most obedient and humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
