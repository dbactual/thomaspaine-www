   PEACE AND LIBERTY, HELD AT THE THATCHED HOUSE TAVERN, ST. JAMES' STREET,

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Paine returned to England on July 13, 1791. A month later he issued the
   following Address and Declaration of the Friends of Universal Peace and
   Liberty, in which he defended the French Revolution to England. This
   manifesto, revealing Paine's advanced revolutionary sentiments, was
   originally signed by J. Horne Tooke, as chairman of the London meeting.
   Later Paine acknowledged its authorship. [in Rights of Man]

   FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS: At a moment like the present, when willful
   misrepresentations are industriously spread by the partisans of arbitrary
   power, and the advocates of passive obedience and court government, we
   think it incumbent on us to declare to the world our principles, and the
   motives of our conduct.

   We rejoice at the glorious event of the French Revolution.

   If it be asked: What is the French Revolution to us? We answer (as it has
   been already answered in another place (Declaration of the Volunteers of
   Belfast.-Author.) ) It is much to us as men: much to us as Englishmen.

   As men we rejoice in the freedom of twenty-five millions of our fellow
   men. We rejoice in the prospect which such a magnificent example opens to
   the world. We congratulate the French nation for having laid the axe to
   the root of tyranny, and for erecting government on the sacred hereditary
   rights of man-rights which appertain to ALL, and not to any one more than
   to another. We know of no human authority superior to that of a whole
   nation; and we profess and proclaim it as our principle that every nation
   has at all times an inherent indefeasible right to constitute and
   establish such government for itself as best accords with its disposition,
   interest, and happiness.

   As Englishmen we also rejoice, because we are immediately interested in
   the French Revolution.

   Without inquiring into the justice on either side of the reproachful
   charges of intrigue and ambition, which the English and French courts have
   constantly made on each other, we confine ourselves to this observation :
   That if the Court of France only was in fault, and the numerous wars which
   have distressed both countries are chargeable to her alone, that Court now
   exists no longer; and the cause and the consequence must cease together.
   The French, therefore, by the revolution they have made, have conquered
   for us as well as for themselves; if it be true that their Court only was
   in fault, and ours never.

   On this state of the case, the French Revolution concerns
   us immediately. We are oppressed with a heavy national debt, a burden of
   taxes, and an expensive administration of government, beyond those of any
   people in the world. We have also a very numerous poor; and we hold that
   the moral obligation of providing for old age, helpless infancy, and
   poverty, is far superior to that of supplying the invented wants of
   courtly extravagance, ambition and intrigue.

   We believe there is no instance to' be produced but in England, of seven
   million inhabitants, which make but little more than one million of
   families, paying yearly SEVENTEEN MILLIONS of taxes.

   As it has always been held out by all administrations that the restless
   ambition of the Court of France rendered this expense necessary to us for
   our own defense, we consequently rejoice as men deeply interested in the
   French Revolution, for that Court, as we have already said, exists no
   longer; and consequently the same enormous expenses need not continue to
   us.

   Thus rejoicing, as we sincerely do, both as men and Englishmen, as lovers
   of universal peace and freedom, and as friends to our own national
   prosperity, and a reduction of our public expenses, we cannot but express
   our astonishment that any part, or any members of our own government,
   should reprobate the extinction of that very power in France, or wish to
   see it restored, to whose influence they formerly attributed (while they
   appeared to lament) the enormous increase of our own burdens and taxes.

   What, then, are they sorry that the pretense for new and oppressive taxes,
   and the occasion for continuing many of the old taxes, will be at an end?
   If so, and if it is the policy of courts and of court governments, to
   prefer enemies to friends, and a system of war to that of peace, as
   affording more pretenses for places, offices, pensions, revenue and
   taxation, it is high time for the people of every nation to look with
   circumspection to their own interests.

   Those who pay the expense, and not those who participate in the emoluments
   arising from it, are the persons immediately interested in inquiries of
   this kind. We are a part of that national body on whom this annual expense
   of seventeen millions falls; and we consider the present opportunity of
   the French Revolution as a most happy one for lessening the enormous load
   under which this nation groans. If this be not done we shall then have
   reason to conclude that the cry of intrigue and ambition
   against other courts is no more than the common cant of all courts.

   We think it also necessary to express our astonishment that a government,
   desirous of being called FREE, should prefer connection with the  most
   despotic and arbitrary powers in Europe. We know of none more deserving
   this description than those of Turkey and Prussia, and the whole
   combination of German despots. Separated, as we happily are by nature,
   from the tumults of the Continent, we reprobate all systems and intrigues
   which sacrifice (and that, too, at a great expense), the blessings of our
   natural situation! Such systems cannot have a national origin.

   If we are asked, what government is ? We hold it to be nothing more than a
   NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, and we hold that to be the best which secures to
   every man his rights, and promotes the greatest quantity of happiness with
   the least expense.

   We live to improve, or we live in vain; and therefore we admit of no
   maxims of government or policy on the mere score of antiquity, or other
   men's authority, the old Whigs or the new.

   We will exercise the reason with which we are endued, or we possess it
   unworthily. As reason is given at all times, it is for the purpose of
   being used at all times.

   Among the blessings which the French Revolution has produced to that
   nation, we enumerate the abolition of the feudal system of injustice and
   tyranny on the fourth of August, 1789. Beneath the feudal system all
   Europe has long groaned, and from it England is not yet free. Game laws,
   borough tenures, and tyrannical monopolies of numerous kinds, still remain
   among us; but rejoicing as we sincerely do, in the freedom of others, till
   we shall happily accomplish our own, we intended to commemorate this
   prelude to the universal extirpation of the feudal system, by meeting on
   the anniversary of that day (the fourth of August) at the Crown and
   Anchor.

   From this meeting we were prevented by the interference of
   certain unnamed and skulking persons with the master of the tavern, who
   informed us, that on their representations he could not receive us. Let
   those who live by, or countenance feudal oppressions, take the reproach of
   this ineffectual meanness and cowardice to themselves. They cannot stifle
   the public declaration of our honest, open, and avowed opinions.

   These are our principles, and these our sentiments. They embrace the
   interest and happiness of the great body of the nation of which we are a
   part. As to riots and tumults, let those answer for them, who, by willful
   misrepresentations, endeavor to excite and promote them; or who seek to
   stun the sense of the nation, and to lose the great cause of public good
   in the outrages of a misinformed mob. We take our ground on principles
   that require no such riotous aid. We have nothing to apprehend from the
   poor; for we are pleading their cause. And we fear not proud oppression,
   for we have truth on our side.

   We say, and we repeat it, that the French Revolution opens to the world an
   opportunity in which all good citizens must rejoice-that of promoting the
   general happiness of man. And that it moreover offers to this country in
   particular, an opportunity of reducing our enormous taxes.

   These are our objects, and we will pursue them.

   J. HORNE TOOKE,

   Chairman.
