   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.

   Dear Sir

   I mentioned in one of my essays of my design of going this Spring to
   Europe. I intend landing in france and from thence to England, and that I
   should take the model with me. The time I had fixed with myself was May,
   but understanding (since I saw you yesterday) that no french Packet sails
   that month, I must either take the April packet or wait till June. As soon
   as I can get ready by the April packet I intend not omitting the
   opportunity. My Father and Mother are yet living whom I am very anxious to
   see, and have informed them of my coming over the ensuing summer.

   I propose going from hence by the Stage on Wednesday for New York and
   shall be glad to be favoured with the care of any letters of yours to
   France or England. My stay in Paris, when with Col Laurens, was so short
   that I do not feel myself introduced there, for I was in no house
   but at Passy and the Hotel Col Laurens was at. As I have taken a part in
   the Revolution and politics of this Country, and am not an unknown
   character in the political world, I conceive it would be proper in my
   going to Paris, that I should pay my respects to Count Vergennes to whom I
   am personally unknown, and I shall be very glad if a letter from you to
   him affording me that opportunity or rendering my waiting on him easy to
   me, for it so often happens that men live to forfeit the reputation at one
   time they gained at another that it is prudent not to presume too much on
   one's self.

   The Marquis Le Fayette I am the most known to of any gentlemen 
   in France &mdash; 
   should he be absent from Paris there are none I am much acquainted with. I
   am on exceeding good terms with Mr. Jefferson which will necessarily be
   the first place I go to.

   As I had the honor of your introduction to America it will add to my
   happiness to have the same friendship continued to me on the present
   occasion.

   Respecting the Model, I shall be obliged to you for a letter to some of
   the Commissioners in that department. I shall be glad to hear their
   opinion of it &mdash; If they will undertake the experiment 
   of two Ribs, it will decide the matter and promote the work here &mdash; 
   but this need not be mentioned &mdash;

   The Assembly have appointed another Committee consisting of Mr. Morris
   Mr. Clymer Mr. Fitzsimmons Mr. Wheeler Mr. Robinson, to confer with me
   on the undertaking &mdash; The matter therefore will remain suspended till my
   return next Winter. It is worth waiting this event because if a single
   Arch to that extent will answer all difficulties in that River or others
   if the same condition are overcome at once. I will do myself the pleasure
   of waiting on you tomorrow and am

   Dear Sir your much Obliged and Obedient hHmble Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
