   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Shortly after Common Sense was published, a number of Tories and
   conservative Whigs hurried into print with answers to Paine's great
   manifesto in the hope that they could persuade the American people not to
   follow Paine along "the dark and untrodden way of Independence and
   Republicanism. The most important attack upon Common Sense was a series of
   letters signed "Cato" which appeared in the Pennsylvania Gazette beginning
   in April, 1776. The letters were written by the Rev. Dr. William Smith,
   Provost of the College of Philadelphia and a clergyman of the Anglican
   church. Dr. Smith was the spokesman for the wealthy aristocracy and voiced
   their opposition to "Independence and Republicanism."

   Paine's four letters in reply to "Cato," known as The Forester's Letters,
   first appeared in the Pennsylvania Journal for April 3, 10, 24, and May 8,
   1776. They were immediately copied in many other contemporary newspapers,
   spread Paine's influence throughout different sections of the country, and
   helped to crystallize public opinion in favor of a Declaration of
   Independence. In these letters Paine brilliantly expanded and elaborated
   many of the arguments he had first advanced in Common Sense.

   To CATO

   TO be nobly wrong is more manly than to be meanly right. Only let the
   error be disinterested-let it wear not the mask, but the mark of
   principle, and 'tis pardonable. It is on this large and liberal ground,
   that we distinguish between men and their tenets, and generously preserve
   our friendship for the one, while we combat with every prejudice of the
   other. But let not Cato take this compliment to himself; he stands
   excluded from the benefit of the distinction; he deserves it not. And if
   the sincerity of disdain can add a cubit to the stature of my sentiments,
   it shall not be wanting.

   It is indifferent to me who the writer of Cato's letters is, and
   sufficient for me to know, that they are gorged with absurdity, confusion,
   contradiction and the most notorious and willful falsehoods. Let Cato and
   his faction be against independence and welcome; their consequence will
   not now turn the scale: But let them have regard to justice, and pay some
   attention to the plain doctrine of reason. Where these are wanting, the
   sacred cause of truth applauds our anger, and dignifies it with the name
   of virtue.

   Four letters have already appeared under the specious name of Cato. What
   pretensions the writer of them can have to the signature, the public will
   best determine; while, on my own part, I prophetically content myself with
   contemplating the similarity of their exits. The first of those letters
   promised a second, the second a third, the third a fourth; the fourth hath
   since made its appearance, and still the writer keeps wide of the
   question. Why does he thus loiter in the suburbs of the dispute? Why has
   he not shown us what the numerous blessings of reconciliation [with Great
   Britain] are, and proved them practicable? But he cunningly avoids the
   point. He cannot but discover the rock he is driving on. The fate of the
   Roman Cato is before his eyes. And that the public may be prepared for his
   funeral, and for his funeral oration, I will venture to predict the time
   and the manner of his exit. The moment he explains his terms of
   reconciliation the typographical Cato dies. If they be calculated to
   please the [British] Cabinet they will not go down with the colonies: and
   if they be suited to the colonies they will be rejected by the Cabinet:
   The line of no-variation is yet unfound; and, like the philosopher's
   stone, doth not exist. "I am bold," says Cato, "to declare and yet hope to
   make it evident to every honest man, that the true interest of America
   lies in reconciliation with Great Britain on constitutional principles."

   This is a curious way of lumping the business indeed! And Cato may as well
   attempt to catch lions in a mousetrap as to hope to allure the public with
   such general and unexplained expressions. It is now a mere bugbear to talk
   of reconciliation on constitutional principles unless the terms of the
   first be produced and the sense of the other be defined; and unless he
   does this he does nothing.

   To follow Cato through every absurdity and falsehood in the compass of a1
   letter is impossible; neither is it now necessary. Cassandra (and I thank
   him) has saved me much trouble; there is a spirit in his remarks which
   honesty only can inspire, and a uniformity in the conduct of his letters
   which the want of principle can never arrive at2. Mark that, Cato.

   One observation which I cannot help making on Cato's letters, is that they
   are addressed "To the People of Pennsylvania" only: In almost any other
   writer this might have passed unnoticed, but we know it hath mischief in
   its meaning. The particular circumstance of a convention is undoubtedly
   Provincial, but the great business of the day is Continental. And he who
   dares to endeavor to withdraw this province from the glorious union by
   which all are supported, deserves the reprobation of all men. It is the
   true interest of the whole to go hand in hand; and dismal in every
   instance would be the fate of that Colony should retreat from the
   protection of the rest.

   The first of Cato's letters is insipid in its style, language and
   substance; crowded with personal and private innuendues and directly
   levelled against "the Majesty of the People of Pennsylvania." The
   Committee could only call, propose, or recommend a Convention3; but, like
   all other public measures, it still rested with the people at large,
   whether they would approve it or not; and Cato's reasoning on the right or
   wrong of that choice is contemptible; because, if the body of the people
   had thought, or should still think that the Assembly (or any of their
   delegates in Congress) by setting under the embarrassment of oaths, and
   entangled with government and governors, are not so perfectly free as they
   ought to be, they undoubtedly had and still have both the right and the
   power to place even the whole authority of the Assembly in any body of men
   they please; and whoever is hardy enough to say to the contrary is an
   enemy to mankind. The constitution of Pennsylvania hath been twice changed
   through the cunning of former proprietors; surely, the people, whose
   right, power, and property is greater than that of any single man, may
   make such alterations in their mode of government as the change of times
   and things requires. Cato is exceedingly fond of impressing us with the
   importance of our "chartered constitution." Alas! We are not now, Sir, to
   be led away by the jingle of a phrase. Had we framed our conduct by the
   contents of the present charters, we had ere now been in a state of
   helpless misery. That very assembly you mention has broken it, and been
   obliged to break it, in almost every instance of their proceedings. Hold
   it up to the public and it is transparent with holes; pierced with as many
   deadly wounds as the body of M'Leod4. Disturb not its remains, Cato, nor
   dishonor with another funeral oration.

   There is nothing in Cato's first letter worthy of notice but the following
   insinuating falsehood: "Grievous as the least restraint of the press must
   always be to a people entitled to freedom, it must be the more so, when it
   is not only unwarranted by those to whom they have committed the care of
   their liberties but cannot be warranted by them, consistent with liberty
   itself." The rude and unscholastical confusion of persons in the above
   paragraph, though it throws an obscurity on the meaning, still leaves it
   discoverable. Who, Sir, has laid any restraint on the liberty of the
   press? I know of no instance in which the press has ever been the object
   of notice in this province, except on account of the Tory letter from Kent
   county, which was first published last spring in the Pennsylvania Ledger,
   and which it was the duty of every good man to detect because the honesty
   of the press is as great an object to society as the freedom of it. If
   this is the restraint you complain of, we know your true character at
   once; and that it is so, appears evident from the expression which
   immediately follows the above quotation: your words are, "Nevertheless, we
   readily submitted to it while the least colorable pretence could be
   offered for requiring such a submission." Who submitted, Cato? we Whigs,
   or we Tories? Until you clear up this, Sir, you must content yourself with
   being ranked among the rankest of the writing Tories; because no other
   body of men can have any pretence to complain of want of freedom of the
   press. It is not your throwing out, now and then, little popular phrases
   which can protect you from suspicion; they are only the gildings under
   which the poison is conveyed, and without which you dared not to renew
   your attempts on the virtue of the people.

   Cato's second letter, or the greatest part thereof, is taken up with the
   reverence due from us to the persons and authority of the commissioners,
   whom Cato vainly and ridiculously styles ambassadors coming to negotiate a
   peace. How came Cato not to be let a little better into the secret? The
   act of Parliament which describes the powers of these men has been in this
   city upwards of a month, and in the hands too of Cato's friends. No, Sir,
   they are not the ambassadors of peace, but the distributors of pardons,
   mischief, and insult. Cato discovers a gross ignorance of the British
   Constitution in supposing that these men can be empowered to act as
   ambassadors. To prevent his future errors I will set him right. The
   present war differs from every other, in this instance, viz. that it is
   not carried under the prerogative of the crown as other wars have always
   been, but under the authority of the whole legislative power united; and
   as the barriers which stand in the way of a negotiation are not
   proclamations but acts of Parliament, it evidently follows, that were even
   the king of England here in person, he could not ratify the terms or
   conditions of a reconciliation; because, in the single character of king
   he could not stipulate for the repeal of any acts of Parliament, neither
   can the Parliament stipulate for him. There is no body of men more jealous
   of their privileges than the Commons: Because they sell them. Mark that,
   Cato.

   I have not the least doubt upon me but that their business (exclusive of
   granting us pardons) is down right bribery and corruption. It is the
   machine by which they effect all their plans. We ought to view them as
   enemies of a most dangerous species, and he who means not to be corrupted
   by them will enter his protest in time. Are they not the very men who are
   paid for voting in every measure against us, and ought we not to suspect
   their designs? Can we view the barbarians as friends? Would it be prudent
   to trust the viper in our very bosoms? Or to suffer them to ramble at
   large among us while such doubtful characters as Cato have a being upon
   the continent? Yet let their persons be safe from injury and outrage-but
   trust them not. Our business with them is short and explicit, viz.: We are
   desirous of peace, gentlemen; we are ready to ratify the terms, and will
   virtuously fulfill the conditions thereof; but we should deserve all and
   every misery which tyranny can inflict, were we, after suffering such a
   repetition of savage barbarities, to come under your government again.

   Cato, by way of stealing into credit, says, "that the contest we are
   engaged in is founded on the most noble and virtuous principles which can
   animate the mind of man. We are contending (says he) against an arbitrary
   ministry for the rights of Englishmen." No, Cato, we are now contending
   against an arbitrary king to get clear of his tyranny. While the dispute
   rested in words only, it might be called "contending with the ministry,"
   but since it is broken out into open war, it is high time to have done
   with such silly and water-gruel definitions. But it suits not Cato to
   speak the truth. It is his interest to dress up the sceptred savage in the
   mildest colors. Cato's patent for a large tract of land is yet unsigned.
   Alas poor Cato!

   Cato proceeds very importantly to tell us, "that the eyes of all Europe
   are upon us." This stale and hackneyed phrase has had a regular descent,
   from many of the king's speeches down to several of the speeches in
   Parliament; from thence it took a turn among the little wits and bucks of
   St. James's; till after suffering all the torture of senseless repetition,
   and being reduced to a state of vagrancy, it was charitably picked up to
   embellish the second letter of Cato. It is truly of the bug-bear kind,
   contains no meaning, and the very using it discovers a barrenness of
   invention. It signifies nothing to tell us "that the eyes of all Europe
   are upon us," unless he had likewise told us what they are looking at us
   for: which as he hath not done, I will. They are looking at us, Cato, in
   hopes of seeing a final separation between Britain and the colonies, that
   they, the lookers-on, may partake of a free and uninterrupted trade with
   the whole continent of America. Cato, thou reasonest wrong.

   For the present, Sir, farewell. I have seen thy soliloquy and despise it.
   Remember thou hast thrown me the glove, Cato, and either thee or I must
   tire. I fear not the field of fair debate, but thou hast stepped aside and
   made it personal. Thou hast tauntingly called on me by name; and if I
   cease to hunt thee from every lane and lurking hole of mischief, and bring
   thee not a trembling culprit before the public bar, then brand me with
   reproach, by naming me in the list of your confederates.

   THE FORESTER.

   II

   To CATO

   Before I enter on the more immediate purpose of this letter, I think it
   necessary, once for all, to endeavor to settle as clearly as I can, the
   following point, viz: How far personality is concerned in any political
   debate. The general maxim is, that measures and not men are the thing in
   question, and the maxim is undeniably just when rightly understood. Cato
   as a refuge for himself, hath quoted the author of Common Sense who in his
   preface says, "That the object for attention is the doctrine itself not
   the man," that is, not the rank or condition of the man. For whether he is
   with those whose fortune is already made, or with those whose fortune is
   yet to make, or among those who seldom think or care whether they make
   any, is a matter wholly out of the question and entirely confined to
   himself. But the political characters, political dependencies, and
   political connections of men, being of a public nature, differ exceedingly
   from the circumstances of private life; and are in many instances so
   nearly related to the measures they propose, that to prevent our being
   deceived by the last, we must be acquainted with the first. A total
   ignorance of men lays us under the danger of mistaking plausibility for
   principle. Could the wolf bleat like the lamb the flock would soon be
   enticed into ruin; wherefore to prevent the mischief, he ought to be seen
   as well as heard. There never was nor ever will be, nor ever ought to be,
   any important political debate carried on, in which a total separation in
   all cases between men and measures could be admitted with sufficient
   safety. When hypocrisy shall be banished from the earth, the knowledge of
   men will be unnecessary, because their measures cannot then be fraudulent;
   but until that time come (which never will come) they ought, under proper
   limitations, to go together. We have already too much secrecy in some
   things and too little in others. Were men more known, and measures more
   concealed, we should have fewer hypocrites and more security.

   As the chief design of these letters is to detect and expose the
   falsehoods and fallacious reasonings of Cato, he must not expect (when
   detected) to be treated like one who had debated fairly; for I will be
   bold to say and to prove, that a grosser violation of truth and reason
   scarcely ever came from the pen of a writer; and the explanations which he
   hath endeavored to impose on the passages which he hath quoted from Common
   Sense, are such as never existed in the mind of the author, nor can they
   be drawn from the words themselves. Neither must Cato expect to be spared
   where his carelessness of expression, and visible want of compassion and
   sentiment, shall give occasion to raise any moral or philosophical
   reflection thereon. These things being premised, I now proceed to review
   the latter part of Cato's second letter.

   In this place Cato begins his first attack on Common Sense, but as he only
   discovers his ill will, and neither offers any arguments against it, nor
   makes any quotations from it, I should in this place pass him by, were it
   not for the following strange assertion: "If little notice," says Cato
   (little opposition he means) "has yet been taken of the publications
   concerning independence, it is neither owing to the popularity of the
   doctrine, the unanswerable nature of the arguments, nor the fear of
   opposing them, as the vanity of the author would suggest." As Cato has
   given us the negative reasons, he ought to have given us the real ones,
   for as he positively tells what it was not owing to, he undoubtedly knows
   what it was owing to, that he delayed his answers so long; but instead of
   telling us that (which perhaps is not proper to be told), he flies from
   the argument with the following plump declarations, "Nine-tenths of the
   people of Pennsylvania," says he, "yet abhor the doctrine." But stop,
   Cato! not quite so fast, friend! If this be true, how came they, so late
   as the second of March last, to elect for a Burgess of this city, a
   gentleman of known independent principles, and one of the very few to whom
   the author of Common Sense showed some part thereof while in manuscript.5

   Cato is just as unfortunate in the following paragraph. "Those," says he,
   "who made the appeal (that is, published the pamphlet) have but little
   cause to triumph in its success. Of this they seem sensible: and, like
   true quacks, are constantly pestering us with additional doses till the
   stomachs of their patients begin wholly to revolt." It is Cato's hard fate
   to be always detected: for perhaps there never was a pamphlet, since the
   use of letters were known, about which so little pains were taken, and of
   which so great a number went off in so short a time; I am certain that I
   am within compass when I say one hundred and twenty thousand. The book was
   turned upon the world like an orphan to shift for itself; no plan was
   formed to support it, neither has the author ever published a syllable on
   the subject, from that time till after the appearance of Cato's fourth
   letter; wherefore what Cato says of additional doses administered by the
   author is an absolute falsity; besides which, it comes with an ill grace
   from one, who frequently publishes two letters in a week, and often puts
   them both into one paper-Cato here, Cato there, look where you will.

   At the distance of a few lines from the above quotations, Cato presents us
   with a retrospective view of our former state, in which, says he, "we
   considered our connection with Great Britain as our chief happiness- we
   flourished, grew rich, and populous to a degree not to be paralleled in
   history." This assertion is truly of the legerdemain kind, appearing at
   once both right and wrong. All writers on Cato's side have used the same
   argument and conceived themselves invincible; nevertheless, a single
   expression properly placed dissolves the charm, for the cheat lies in
   putting the time for the cause. For the cheat lies in putting the
   consequence for the cause; for had we not flourished the connection had
   never existed or never been regarded, and this is fully proved by the
   neglect shown to the first settlers who had every difficulty to struggle
   with, unnoticed and unassisted by the British court.

   Cato proceeds very industriously to sum up the former declarations of
   Congress and other public bodies, some of which were made upwards of a
   year ago, to prove, that the doctrine of independence hath no sanction
   from them. To this I shall give Cato one general answer which is, that had
   he produced a thousand more such authorities they would now amount to
   nothing, they are out of date; times and things are altered; the true
   character of the king was but little known among the body of the people of
   America a year ago; willing to believe him good, they fondly called him
   so, but have since found that Cato's royal sovereign, is a royal savage.

   Cato has introduced the above-mentioned long quotation of authorities
   against independence, with the following curious preface. "Nor have many
   weeks," says he, "yet elapsed since the first open proposition for
   independence was published to the world. By what men of consequence this
   scheme is supported, or whether by any, may possibly be the subject of
   future enquiry. Certainly it has no countenance from the Congress, to
   whose sentiments we look up with reverence. On the contrary, it is
   directly repugnant to every declaration of that respectable body." Now
   Cato, thou hast nailed thyself with a witness! Directly repugnant to every
   declaration of that respectable body! Mind that, Cato, and mark what
   follows. It appears by an extract from the resolves of the Congress,
   printed in the front of the oration delivered by Dr. Smith, in honor of
   that brave man General Montgomery6, that he the doctor, was appointed by
   that honorable body to compose and deliver the same; in the execution of
   which, the orator exclaimed loudly against the doctrine of independence;
   but when a motion was afterwards made in Congress (according to former
   usage), to return the orator thanks, and request a copy for the press, the
   motion was rejected from every part of the house and thrown out without a
   division.

   I now proceed to Cato's third letter, in the opening of which he deserts
   the subject of independence, and renews his attack on the committee.
   Cato's manner of writing has as much order in it as the motion of a
   squirrel. He frequently writes as if he knew not what to write next, just
   as the other jumps about, only because it cannot stand still. Though I am
   sometimes angry with him for his unprincipled method of writing and
   reasoning, I cannot help laughing at other times for his want of
   ingenuity. One instance of which he gives us in kindly warning us against
   "the foul pages of interested writers, and strangers intermeddling in our
   affairs."7 Were I to reply seriously my answer would be this: Thou seemest
   then ignorant, Cato, of that ancient and numerous order which are related
   to each other in all and every part of the globe-with whom the kindred is
   not formed by place or accident, but in principle and sentiment. A
   freeman, Cato, is a stranger nowhere-a slave, everywhere. But were I
   disposed to answer merrily, I should tell him, that as his notions of
   friendship were so very narrow and local, he obliges me to understand,
   that when he addresses the people with the tender title of "my dear
   countrymen" which frequently occurs in his letters, he particularly means
   the long list of Macs published in Donald M'Donald's Commission.8

   In this letter Cato recommends the pamphlet called Plain Truth, a
   performance which hath withered away like a sickly unnoticed weed, and
   which even its advocates are displeased at, and the author ashamed to
   own9. About the middle of this third letter, Cato gives notice of his
   being ready to take the field. "I now proceed," says he, "to give my
   reasons." How Cato has managed the attack we are now to examine; and the
   first remark I shall offer on his conduct is, that he has most unluckily
   entered the list on the wrong side, and discharged his first fire among
   the Tories.

   In order to prove this, I shall give the paragraph entire:-"AGRICULTURE
   and COMMERCE," says Cato, "have hitherto been the happy employments, by
   which these middle colonies have risen into wealth and importance. By them
   the face of the country has been changed from a barren wilderness, into
   the hospitable abodes of peace and plenty. Without them we had either
   never existed as Americans, or existed only as savages. The oaks would
   still have possessed their native spots of earth, and never have appeared
   in the form of ships and houses. What are now well cultivated fields, or
   flourishing cities, would have remained only the solitary haunts of wild
   beasts or of men equally wild." The reader cannot help perceiving that
   through this whole paragraph our connection with Britain is left entirely
   out of the question, and our present greatness attributed to external
   causes, agriculture and commerce. This is a strange way, Cato, of
   overturning Common Sense, which says, "I challenge the warmest advocate
   for reconciliation, to show a single advantage which this continent can
   reap by being connected with Great Britain; I repeat," says he, "the
   challenge: not a single advantage is derived. Our corn will fetch its
   price in any market in Europe; and our imported goods must be paid for,
   buy them where we will." Cato introduces his next paragraph with saying,
   "that much of our former felicity was owing to the protection of England
   is not to be denied." Yes, Cato, I deny it wholly, and for the following
   clear and simple reasons, viz., that our being connected with, and
   submitting to be protected by her, made, and will still make, all her
   enemies, our enemies, or as Common Sense says, "sets us at variance with
   nations who would otherwise seek our friendship, and against whom we have
   neither anger nor complaint."

   The following passage is so glaringly absurd that I shall make but a short
   comment upon it. "And if hereafter," says Cato, "in the fullness of time,
   it shall be necessary to separate from the land that gave birth to [some
   of] our ancestors, it will be in a state of perfect manhood, when we can
   fully wield our own arms, and. protect our commerce and coasts by our own
   fleets." But how are we to come by fleets, Cato, while Britain has the
   government of the continent? Unless we are to suppose, as you have hinted
   in the former paragraph, that our oaks are to grow into ships, and be
   launched self-built from their "native spots of earth." It is Cato's
   misfortune as a writer, not to distinguish justly between magic and
   imagination; while on the other hand there are many passages in his
   letters so seriously and deliberately false, that nothing but the most
   hardened effrontery, and a cast of mind bordering upon impiety, would have
   uttered. He frequently forces me out of the common track of civil
   language, in order to do him justice; moderation and temper being really
   unequal to the task of exposing him.

   Cato, unless he meant to destroy the ground he stood upon, ought not to
   have let the following paragraph be seen. "If our present differences,
   says he, "can be accommodated, there is scarce a probability that Britain
   will ever renew her late fatal system of policy, or attempt again to
   employ force against us." How came Cato to admit the probability of our
   being brought again into the same bloody and expensive situation? But it
   is worth remarking, that those who write without principle, cannot help
   sometimes blundering upon truth. Then there is no real security, Cato, in
   this reconciliation of yours on constitutional principles? It still
   amounts to nothing; and after all this expense of life and wealth, we are
   to rest at last upon hope, hazard, and uncertainty. Why then, by all that
   is sacred, "it is time to part".

   But Cato, after admitting the probability of our being brought again into
   the same situation, proceeds to tell us how we are to conduct ourselves in
   the second quarrel; and that is, by the very same methods we have done the
   present one, viz., to expend millions of treasure, and thousands of lives,
   in order to patch up a second union, that the way may be open for a third
   quarrel; and in this endless and chequered round of blood and treacherous
   peace, has Cato disposed of the continent of America. That I may not be
   thought to do Cato injustice, I have quoted the whole passage: "But should
   Britain be so infatuated," says he, "at any future period, as to think of
   subjugating us, either by the arts of corruption, or oppressive exertions
   of power, can we entertain a doubt but we shall AGAIN, with a virtue equal
   to the present and with the weapons of defence in our hands (when
   necessary) convince her that we are willing by a constitutional connection
   with her, to afford and receive reciprocal benefits; but although subjects
   of the same king, we will not consent to be her slaves."-Come hither, ye
   little ones, whom the poisonous hand of Cato is rearing for destruction,
   and remember the page that warns you of your ruin.

   Cato, in many of his expressions, discovers all that calm command over the
   passions and feelings which always distinguishes the man who has expelled
   them from his heart. Of this careless kind is the before mentioned phrase,
   "our present differences," and the same unpardonable negligence is
   conveyed in the following one: "Although I consider her," says he, "as
   having in her late conduct toward us, acted the part of a cruel stepdame."
   Wonderful sensibility indeed! All the havoc and desolation of unnatural
   war; the destruction of thousands; the burning and depopulating of towns
   and cities; the ruin and separation of friends and families, are just
   sufficient to extort from Cato, this one callous confession. But the cold
   and creeping soul of Cato is a stranger to the manly powers of sympathetic
   sorrow. He moves not, nor can he move in so pure an element. Accustomed to
   lick the hand that has made him visible, and to breathe the gross
   atmosphere of servile and sordid dependence, his soul would now starve on
   virtue, and suffocate in the clear region of disinterested friendship.

   Surely when Cato sat down to write, he either did not expect to be called
   to an account, or was totally regardless of reputation, otherwise he would
   not have endeavored to persuade the public that the doctrine of
   independence was broached in a kind of seditious manner, at a time "when,"
   says he, "some gleams of reconciliation began first to break in upon us."
   Come forth, Cato, and prove the assertion! Where do these gleams of
   reconciliation spring from? Are they to be found in the king's speech, in
   the address of either House of Parliament, or in the act which lets loose
   a whole kennel of pirates upon our property, and commissions another set
   to insult with pardons the very men whom their own measures had sought to
   ruin? Either prove the assertion, Cato, or take the reward of it, for it
   is the part of an incendiary to endeavor with specious falsehoods to
   mislead the credulity of unwary readers. Cato likewise says, that, while
   we continue united, and renounce all thoughts of independence, "we have
   the utmost assurance of obtaining a full redress of our grievances, and an
   ample security against any future violation of our just rights." If Cato
   means to insinuate that we have received such an assurance, let him read
   the conclusion of the preceding paragraph again. The same answer will
   serve for both.

   Perhaps when we recollect the long and unabated cruelty of the British
   court towards us, and remember the many prayers which we have put up both
   to them and for them, the following piece of declamation of Cato can
   hardly be equalled either for absurdity or insanity: "If we now effect
   independence," says he, "we must be considered as a faithless people in
   the sight of all mankind, and could scarcely expect the confidence of any
   nation upon earth, or look up to Heaven for its approving sentence." Art
   thou mad, Cato, or art thou foolish-or art thou both -or art thou worse
   than both? In this passage thou hast fairly gone beyond me. I have not
   language to bring thee back. Thou art safely entrenched indeed! Rest
   therefore in thy stronghold till He who fortified thee in it shall come
   and fetch thee out.

   Cato seems to be possessed of that Jesuitical cunning which always
   endeavors to disgrace what it cannot disprove; and this he sometimes
   effects, by unfairly introducing our terms into his arguments, and thereby
   begets a monster which he sends round the country for a show, and tells
   the good people that the name of it is independence. Of this character are
   several passages in his fourth and fifth letters, particularly when he
   quotes the term "foreign assistance," which he ungenerously explains into
   a surrender of the continent to France and Spain. Such an unfair and
   sophistical reasoner doth not deserve the civility of good manners. He
   creates, likewise, the same confusion by frequently using the word peace
   for union, and thereby charges us falsely by representing us as being
   determined to "reject all proposition of peace." Whereas, our wish is
   peace but not re-union; and though we would gladly listen to the former,
   we are determined to resist every proposal for the latter, come from where
   it will; being fully persuaded, that in the present state of affairs
   separation of governments is the only and best thing that can be done for
   both countries.

   The following case is unjustly put. "There never was a war," says Cato,
   "so implacable, even among states naturally rivals and enemies, or among
   savages themselves, as not to have peace for its object as well as the
   end." But was there ever a war, Cato, which had union for its object? No.
   What Cato means by states naturally rivals and enemies, I shall not
   enquire into, but this I know (for myself at least) that it was not in the
   power of France or Spain, or all the other powers in Europe, to have given
   such a wound, or raised us to such a mortal hatred as Britain hath done.
   We feel the same kind of undescribed anger at her conduct, as we would at
   the sight of an animal devouring its young; and this particular species of
   anger is not generated in the transitory temper of the man, but in the
   chaste and undefiled womb of nature.

   Cato, towards the conclusion of his third letter (at which place I shall
   leave him for the present), compared the state of Britain and America to
   the quarrels of lovers, and from thence infers a probability, that our
   affections will be renewed thereby. This I cannot help looking on as one
   of the most unnatural and distorted similes that can be drawn. Come hither
   ye that are lovers, or ye that have been lovers, and decide the
   controversy between us! What comparison is there between the soft murmurs
   of an heart mourning in secret, and the loud horrors of war-between the
   silent tears of pensive sorrow, and rivers of wasted blood-between the
   sweet strife of affection, and the bitter strife of death-between the
   curable calamities of pettish lovers, and the sad sight of a thousand
   slain! "Get thee behind me," Cato, for thou hast not the feelings of a
   man.

   PHILADELPHIA,

   III

   To CATO

   Cato's partisans may call me furious; I regard it not. There are men, too,
   who have not virtue enough to be angry and that crime perhaps is Cato's.
   He who dares not offend cannot be honest. Having thus balanced the charge,
   I proceed to Cato's 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th letters, all of which, as they
   contain but little matter, I shall dismiss with as little trouble and less
   formality.

   His fourth letter is introduced with a punning soliloquy-Cato's title to
   soliloquies is indisputable; because no man cares for his company.10
   However, he disowns the writing it, and assures his readers that it "was
   really put into his hands." I always consider this confirming mode of
   expression as betraying a suspicion of one's self; and in this place it
   amounts to just as much as if Cato had said, "you know my failing, Sirs,
   but what I tell you now is really true." Well, be it so, Cato; you shall
   have all the credit you ask for; and as to when or where or how you got
   it, who was the author, or who the giver, I shall not enquire after; being
   fully convinced, by the poetical merit of the performance, that though the
   writer of it may be an Allen11, he'll never be a Ramsay12. (Allan Ramsay,
   a famous Scotch poet of genuine wit and humor.-Author.) Thus much for the
   soliloquy; and if this gentle chastisement should be the means of
   preventing Cato or his colleague from mingling their punning nonsense with
   subjects of such a serious nature as the present one truly is, it will
   answer one of the ends it was intended for.

   Cato's fourth, and the greatest part of his fifth letter, are constructed
   on a false meaning uncivilly imposed on a passage quoted from Common
   Sense; and for which, the author of that pamphlet hath a right to expect
   from Cato the usual concessions. I shall quote the passage entire, with
   Cato's additional meaning, and the inferences which he draws therefrom. He
   introduces it with saying, "In my remarks on the pamphlet before me I
   shall first consider those arguments on which, he (the author) appears to
   lay his chief stress; and these are collected under four heads in his
   conclusion, one of which is, 'It is the custom of nations when any two are
   at war, for some other powers not engaged in the quarrel, to step in by
   way of mediators, and bring about the preliminaries of a peace; but while
   America calls herself the subject of Great Britain, no power, however well
   disposed she may be, can offer her mediation.' The meaning contained in
   this passage is so exceedingly plain, and expressed in such easy and
   familiar terms, that it scarcely admits of being made plainer. No one, I
   think, could have understood it any other wise, than that while we
   continue to call ourselves British subjects, the quarrel between us can
   only be called a family quarrel, in which, it would be just as indelicate
   for any other nation to advise, or any ways to meddle or make, even with
   their offers of mediation, as it would be for a third person to interfere
   in a quarrel between a man and his wife. Whereas were we to make use of
   that natural right which all other nations have done before us, and erect
   a government of our own, independent of all the world, the quarrel could
   then be no longer called a family quarrel, but a regular war between the
   two powers of Britain and America, in the same manner as one carried on
   between England and France; and in this state of political separation, the
   neutral powers might kindly render their mediation (as hath always been
   the practice), and bring about the preliminaries of a peace,-not a union,
   Cato, that is quite another thing. But instead of Cato's taking it in this
   easy and natural sense, he flies away on a wrong scent, charges the author
   with proposing to call in foreign assistance; and under this willful
   falsehood raises up a mighty cry after nothing at all. He begins his wild
   and unintelligible comment in the following manner: "Is this," says he
   (meaning the passage already quoted), "common sense, or common nonsense?
   Surely peace13 with Great Britain cannot be the object of this writer,
   after the horrible character he has given of the people of that country,
   and telling us, that reconciliation with them would be our ruin. The
   latter part of the paragraph seems to cast some light upon the former,
   although it contradicts it, for these mediators are not to interfere for
   making up the quarrel, but to widen it by supporting us in a declaration,
   That we are not the subjects .of Great Britain. A new sort of business
   truly for mediators. But this," continues Cato, "leads us directly to the
   main enquiry-What foreign power is able to give us this support?" What
   support, Cato? The passage you have quoted neither says a syllable, nor
   insinuates a hint about support:-It speaks only of neutral powers in the
   neighborly character of mediators between those which are at war; and says
   it is the custom of European courts to do so. Cato has already raised
   commissioners into ambassadors; but how he could transform mediators into
   men in arms, and mediation into military alliance, is surpassingly
   strange. Read the part over again, Cato; if you find I have charged you
   wrongfully, and will point it out, I will engage that the author of Common
   Sense shall ask your pardon in the public papers, with his name to it: but
   if the error be yours, the concession on your part follows as a duty.

   Though I am fully persuaded that Cato does not believe one half of what
   himself has written, he nevertheless takes amazing pains to frighten his
   readers into a belief of the whole. Tells them of foreign troops (which he
   supposes we are going to send for) ravaging up and down the country; of
   their "bloody massacres, unrelenting persecutions, which would harrow up
   (says he) the very souls of protestants and free- men."  Were they coming,
   Cato, which no one ever dreamed of but yourself (for thank God, we want
   them not), it would be impossible for them to exceed, or even to equal,
   the cruelties practised by the British army in the East Indies: The tying
   men to the mouths of cannon and "blowing them away" was never acted by any
   but an English General, or approved by any but a British court.14 Read the
   proceedings of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs.

   From temporal fears Cato proceeds to spiritual ones, and in a hypocritical
   panic, asks, "To whose share will Pennsylvania fall-that of his most
   Catholic, or his most Christian king? I confess," continues he, "that
   these questions stagger me." I don't wonder at it, Cato-I am glad to hear
   that some kind of remorse hath overtaken you-that you begin to feel that
   you are "heavy laden." You have had a long run, and the stoutest heart
   must fail at last.

   Cato perceiving that the falsehoods in his fourth letter past unreproved,
   ventured boldly on a fifth, in which he continues, enlarging on the same
   convenient bugbear. "In my last," says he, "some notice was taken of the
   dangerous proposition held up by the author of Common Sense, for having
   recourse to foreign assistance." When will Cato learn to speak the truth!
   The assistance which we hope for from France is not armies (we want them
   not), but arms and ammunition. We have already received into this province
   only, near two hundred tons of saltpeter and gunpowder, besides muskets.
   Surely we may continue to cultivate a useful acquaintance, without such
   malevolent beings as Cato raising his barbarous slander thereon. At this
   time it is not only illiberal, but impolitic, and perhaps dangerous to be
   pouring forth such torrents of abuse, as his fourth and fifth letters
   contain, against the only power that in articles of defence hath supplied
   our hasty wants.

   Cato, after expending near two letters in beating down an idol which
   himself only had set up, proudly congratulates himself on the defeat, and
   marches off to new exploits, leaving behind him the following
   proclamation: "Having thus," says Cato, "dispatched his (the author of
   Common Sense's) main argument for independence, which he founds on the
   necessity of calling in foreign assistance, I proceed to examine some
   other parts of his work." Not a syllable, Cato, doth any part of the
   pamphlet in question say of calling in foreign assistance, or even forming
   military alliances. The dream is wholly your own, and is directly
   repugnant both to the letter and spirit of every page in the piece. The
   idea which Common Sense constantly holds up, is to have nothing to do with
   the political affairs of Europe. "As Europe," says the pamphlet, "is our
   market for trade, we ought to form no political connections with any part
   of it. It is the true interest of America to steer clear of all European
   contentions." And where it proposes sending a manifesto to foreign courts
   (which it is high time to do) it recommends it only for the purpose of
   announcing to them the impossibility of our living any longer under the
   British government, and of "assuring such courts of our peaceable
   disposition towards them, and of our desire of entering into trade with
   them." Learn to be an honest man, Cato, and then thou wilt not be thus
   exposed. I have been the more particular in detecting Cato here, because
   it is on this bubble that his air-built battery against independence is
   raised-a poor foundation indeed! which even the point of a pin, or a pen,
   if you please, can demolish with a touch, and bury the formidable Cato
   beneath the ruins of a vapor.

   From this part of his fifth letter to the end of his seventh he entirely
   deserts the subject of independence, and sets up the proud standard of
   kings, in preference to a republican form of government. My remarks on
   this part of the subject will be general and concise.

   In this part of the debate Cato shelters himself chiefly in quotations
   from other authors, without reasoning much on the matter himself;15 in
   answer to which, I present him with a string of maxims and reflections,
   drawn from the nature of things, without borrowing from anyone. Cato may
   observe, that I scarcely ever quote; the reason is, I always think. But to
   return.

   Government should always be considered as a matter of convenience, not of
   right. The scripture institutes no particular form of government, but it
   enters a protest against the monarchical form; and a negation on one
   thing, where two only are offered, and one must be chosen, amounts to an
   affirmative on the other. Monarchical government was first set up by the
   heathens, and the Almighty permitted it to the Jews as a punishment. "I
   gave them a king in mine anger."-Hosea xiii. n . A republican form of
   government is pointed out by nature-kingly governments by an unequality of
   power. In republican governments, the leaders of the people, if improper,
   are removable by vote; kings only by arms: an unsuccessful vote in the
   first case, leaves the voter safe; but an unsuccessful attempt in the
   latter, is death. Strange, that that which is our right in the one, should
   be our ruin in the other. From which reflection follows this maxim: That
   that mode of government in which our right becomes our ruin, cannot be the
   right one. If all human nature be corrupt, it is needless to strengthen
   the corruption by establishing a succession of kings, who, be they ever so
   base, are still to be obeyed; for the manners of a court will always have
   an influence over the morals of a people. A republican government hath
   more true grandeur in it than a kingly one. On the part of the public it
   is more consistent with freemen to appoint their rulers than to have them
   born; and on the part of those who preside, it is far nobler to be a ruler
   by the choice of the people, than a king by the chance of birth. Every
   honest delegate is more than a monarch. Disorders will unavoidably happen
   in all states, but monarchical governments are the most subject thereto,
   because the balance hangs uneven. "Nineteen rebellions and eight civil
   wars in England since the conquest." Whatever commotions are produced in
   republican states, are not produced by a republican spirit, but by those
   who seek to extinguish it. A republican state cannot produce its own
   destruction, it can only suffer it. No nation of people, in their true
   senses, when seriously reflecting on the rank which God hath given them,
   and the reasoning faculties he hath blessed them with, would ever, of
   their own consent, give any one man a negative power over the whole: No
   man since the fall hath ever been equal to the trust, wherefore 'tis
   insanity in us to intrust them with it; and in this sense, all those who
   have had it have done us right by abusing us into reason. Nature seems
   sometimes to laugh at mankind, by giving them so many fools for kings; at
   other times, she punishes their folly by giving them tyrants; but England
   must have offended highly to be cursed with both in one. Rousseau proposed
   a plan for establishing a perpetual European peace; which was, for every
   state in Europe to send ambassadors to form a General Council, and when
   any difference happened between any two nations, to refer the matter to
   arbitration instead of going to arms. This would be forming a kind of
   European Republic: But the proud and plundering spirit of kings has not
   peace for its object. They look not at the good of mankind. They set not
   out upon that plan. And if the history of the creation and the history of
   kings be compared together the result will be this-that God hath made a
   world, and kings have robbed him of it.

   But that which sufficiently establishes the republican mode of government,
   in preference to a kingly one, even when all other arguments are left out,
   is this simple truth, that all men are republicans by nature, and
   royalists only by fashion. And this is fully proved by that passionate
   adoration which all men show to that great and almost only remaining
   bulwark of natural rights, trial by juries, which is founded on a pure
   republican basis. Here the power of kings is shut out. No royal negative
   can enter this court. The jury, which is here supreme, is a Republic, a
   body of judges chosen from among the people.

   The charter which secures this freedom in England, was formed, not in the
   senate, but in the field; and insisted on by the people, not granted by
   the crown; the crown in that instance granted nothing, but only renounced
   its former tyrannies, and bound itself over to its future good behavior.
   It was the compromise, by which the wearer of it made his peace with the
   people, and the condition on which he was suffered to reign.

   Here ends my reply to all the letters which have at present appeared under
   the signature of Cato, being at this time seven in number. I have made no
   particular remarks on his last two, which treat only of the mode of
   government, but answered them generally. In one place I observe, he
   accuses the writer of Common Sense with inconsistency in having declared,
   "That no man was a warmer wisher for reconciliation than himself, before
   the fatal 19th of April, 1775"; "that is," (says Cato) "reconciliation to
   monarchical government." To which I reply that war ought to be no man's
   wish, neither ought any man to perplex a state, already formed, with his
   private opinions; "the mode of government being a proper consideration for
   those countries" only "which have their governments yet to form." (Common
   Sense).

   On a review of the ground which I have gone over in Cato's letters,
   (exclusive of what I have omitted) I find the following material charges
   against him:

   First. He has accused the committee with crimes generally; stated none,
   nor proved, nor attempted to prove any.

   N . B . The pretence of charging the acts of a body of men on individuals,
   is too slender to be admitted.16

   Secondly. He has falsely complained to the public of the restraint of the
   press.

   Thirdly. He has wickedly asserted that "gleams of reconciliation hath
   lately broken in upon us," thereby grossly deceiving the people.

   Fourthly. He has insinuated, as if he wished the public to believe, that
   we had received "the utmost assurance of having all our grievances
   redressed, and an ample security against any future violation of our just
   rights."

   Fifthly. He has spread false alarms of calling in foreign troops.

   Sixthly. He has turned the scripture into a jest. Ez. 35.

   These falsehoods, if uncontradicted, might have passed for truths, and the
   minds of persons remote from better intelligence might have been greatly
   embarrassed thereby. Let our opinions be what they will, truth as to facts
   should be strictly adhered to. It was this affecting consideration that
   drew out the Forester (a perfect volunteer) to the painful task of writing
   three long letters, and occasioned to the public the trouble of reading
   them.

   Having for the present closed my correspondence with Cato, I shall
   conclude this letter with a well meant affectionate address

   To THE PEOPLE

   It is not a time to trifle. Men, who know they deserve nothing from their
   country, and whose hope is on the arm that has fought to enslave you, may
   hold out to you, as Cato has done, the false light of reconciliation.
   There is no such thing. 'Tis gone! 'Tis past! The grave has parted us-and
   death, in the persons of the slain, has cut the thread of life between
   Britain and America.

   Conquest, and not reconciliation is the plan of Britain But admitting even
   the last hope of the Tories to happen, which is, that our enemies after a
   long succession of losses, wearied and disabled, should despairingly throw
   down their arms and propose a reunion; in that case, what is to be done?
   Are defeated and disappointed tyrants to be considered like mistaken and
   converted friends? Or would it be right, to receive those for Governors,
   who, had they been conquerors, would have hung us up for traitors?
   Certainly not. Reject the offer then, and propose another; which is, we
   will make peace with you as with enemies, but we will never re-unite with
   you as friends. This effected, and you secure to yourselves the pleasing
   prospect of an eternal peace. America, remote from all the wrangling
   world, may live at ease. Bounded by the ocean, and backed by the
   wilderness, who has she to fear, but her GOD?

   Be not deceived. It is not a little that is at stake. Reconciliation will
   not now go down, even if it were offered. 'Tis a dangerous question; for
   the eyes of all men begin to open. There is now no secret in the matter;
   there ought to be none. It is a case that concerns every man, and every
   man ought to lay it to heart. He that is here and he that was born here
   are alike concerned. It is needless, too, to split the business into a
   thousand parts, and perplex it with endless and fruitless investigations,
   in the manner that a writer signed a Common Man hath done. This
   unparalleled contention of nations is not to be settled like a school-
   boy's task of pounds, shillings, pence and fractions. That writer, though
   he may mean well, is strangely below the mark: for the first and great
   question, and that which involves every other in it, and from which every
   other will flow, is happiness. Can this continent be happy under the
   government of Great Britain or not? Secondly, can she be happy under a
   government of our own? To live beneath the authority of those whom we
   cannot love, is misery, slavery, or what name you please. In that case,
   there will never be peace. Security will be a thing unknown, because a
   treacherous friend in power is the most dangerous of enemies. The answer
   to the second question, can America be happy under a government of her
   own, is short and simple, viz. As happy as she please; she hath a blank
   sheet to write upon. Put it not off too long.17

   Painful as the task of speaking truth must sometimes be, yet I cannot
   avoid giving the following hint, because much, nay almost everything
   depends upon it; and that is, a thorough knowledge of the persons whom we
   trust. It is the duty of the public, at this time, to scrutinize closely
   into the conduct of their Committee Members, Members of Assembly and
   Delegates in Congress; to know what they do, and their motives for so
   doing. Without doing this, we shall never know who to confide in; but
   shall constantly mistake friends for enemies, and enemies for friends,
   till in the confusion of persons we sacrifice the cause. I am led to this
   reflection by the following circumstance. That the gentleman to whom the
   unwise and arbitrary instructions to the delegates of this province owe
   their being, and who hath bestowed all his power to support them, is said
   to be the same person who, when the ships now on the stocks were wanting
   timber, refused to sell it, and thus by preventing our strength to cry out
   of our insufficiency. But his hour of fame is past-he is hastening to his
   political exit.

   THE FORESTER.

    

   IV

   Whoever will take the trouble of attending to the progress and
   changeability of times and things, and the conduct of mankind thereon,
   will find, that extraordinary circumstances do sometimes arise before us,
   of a species, either so purely natural or so perfectly original, that none
   but the man of nature can understand them. When precedents fail to spirit
   us, we must return to the first principles of things for information; and
   think, as if we were the first men that thought. And this is the true
   reason that, in the present state of affairs, the wise are become foolish,
   and the foolish wise. I am led to this reflection by not being able to
   account for the conduct of the Quakers on any other: for although they do
   not seem to perceive it themselves, yet it is amazing to hear with what
   unanswerable ignorance many of that body, wise in other matters, will
   discourse on the present one. Did they hold places or commissions under
   the king, were they governors of provinces, or had they any interest
   apparently distinct from us, the mystery would cease; but as they have
   not, their folly is best attributed to that superabundance of worldly
   knowledge which in original matters is too cunning to be wise. Back to the
   first plain path of nature, friends, and begin anew: for in this business
   your first footsteps were wrong. You have now travelled to the summit of
   inconsistency, and that with such accelerated rapidity as to acquire
   autumnal ripeness by the first of May. Now your resting time comes on. You
   have done your utmost and must abide the consequences. Yet who can reflect
   on such conduct without feeling concern! Who can look, unaffected, on a
   body of thoughtful men, undoing in one rash hour the labor of seventy
   years: Or what can be said in their excuse, more, than that they have
   arrived at their second childhood, the infancy of threescore and ten.18

   But my chief design, in this letter, is to set forth the inconsistency,
   partiality, and injustice of the dependent faction19, and like an honest
   man, who courts no favor, to show to them the dangerous ground they stand
   upon; in order to do which, I must refer to the business, event and
   probable consequences of the late election.

   The business of that day was to do what? Why, to elect four burgesses to
   assist those already elected, in conducting the military proceedings of
   this province, against the power of that crown by whose authority they
   pretend to sit: and those gentlemen when elected, are according to the
   rules of that House (as the rest have done) to take an oath of allegiance
   to serve the same king against whom this province, with themselves at the
   head thereof, are at war: and a necessary qualification required of many
   voters was, that they likewise should swear allegiance to the same king
   against whose power the same house of assembly had just before obliged
   them either to fine or take up arms. Did ever national hypocrisy arise to
   such a pitch as this! Under the pretence of moderation we are running into
   the most damnable sins. It is now the duty of every man from the pulpit
   and from the press, in his family and in the street to cry out against it.
   Good God! Have we no remembrance of duty left to the King of Heaven! No
   conscientious awe to restrain this sacrifice of sacred things? Is this our
   chartered privilege? This our boasted constitution, that we can sin and
   feel it not? The clergy of the English church, of which I profess myself a
   member, complain of their situation, and wish relief; in short, every
   thinking man must feel distress. Yet, to the credit of the people be it
   spoken, the sin lies not at their door. We can trace the iniquity in this
   province to the fountain head, and see by what delusions it has imposed on
   others. The guilt centers in a few, and flows from the same source, that a
   few years ago avariciously suffered the frontiers of this province to be
   deluged in blood; and though the vengeance of heaven has slept since, it
   may awake too soon for their repose.

   A motion was sometime ago made to elect a convention to take into
   consideration the state of the province. A more judicious proposal could
   not be thought of. Our present condition is alarming. We are worse off
   than other provinces, and such an inquiry is highly necessary. The House
   of Assembly in its present form is disqualified for such business, because
   it is a branch from that power against whom we are contending. Besides,
   they are in intercourse with the king's representative, and the members
   which compose the house have, as members thereof taken an oath to discover
   to the king of England the very business which, in that inquiry, would
   unavoidably come before them. Their minds too are warped and prejudiced by
   the provincial instructions they have arbitrarily and without right issued
   forth. They are again improper because the inquiry would necessarily
   extend to them as a body, to see how far it is proper to trust men with
   such unlimited power as they have lately assumed. In times like these, we
   must trace to the root and origin of things; it being the only way to
   become right, when we are got systematically wrong. The motion for a
   convention alarmed the crown and proprietary dependents,20 but, to every
   man of reflection, it had a cordial and restorative quality. The case is,
   first, we are got wrong-Secondly, how shall we get right? Not by a House
   of Assembly; because they cannot sit as judges, in a case, where their own
   existence under their present form and authority is to be judged of.
   However, the objectors found out a way, as they thought, to supersede the
   necessity of a convention, by promoting a bill for augmenting the number
   of representatives; not perceiving at the same time that such an
   augmentation would increase the necessity of a convention; because, the
   more any power is augmented, which derives its authority from our enemies,
   the more unsafe and dangerous it becomes to us. Far be it from the writer
   of this to censure the individuals which compose that House; his aim being
   only against the chartered authority under which it acts. However, the
   bill passed into a law (which shows, that in Pennsylvania, as well as in
   England, there is no Constitution, but only a temporary form of
   government).21 While, in order to show the inconsistency of the House in
   its present state, the motion for a convention was postponed, and four
   conscientious independent gentlemen were proposed as candidates, on the
   augmentation, who, had they been elected would not have taken the oaths
   necessary to admit a person as member of that Assembly. And in that case,
   the house would have had neither one kind of authority or another, while
   the old part remained sworn to divulge to the king what the new part
   thought it their duty to declare against him. Thus matters stood on the
   morning of election.

   On our side we had to sustain the loss of those good citizens who are now
   before the walls of Quebec, and other parts of the continent; while the
   Tories by never stirring out remain at home to take the advantage of
   elections; and this evil prevails more or less from the Congress down to
   the committees. A numerous body of Germans of property, zealots in the
   cause of freedom, were likewise excluded for non-allegiance.
   Notwithstanding which, the Tory non-conformists, that is those who are
   advertised as enemies to their country, were admitted to vote on the other
   side. A strange contradiction indeed! To which were added the
   testimonizing Quakers, who, after suffering themselves to be duped by the
   meanest of all passions, 'religious spleen, endeavor in a vague
   uncharitable manner to possess the Roman Catholics of the same disease.
   These parties, with such others as they could influence, were headed by
   the proprietary dependents to support the British and proprietary power
   against the public. They had pompously given out that nine- tenths of the
   people were on their side. A vast majority truly! But it so happened that,
   notwithstanding the disadvantages we laid under of having many of our
   votes rejected, others disqualified for non-allegiance, with the great
   loss sustained by absentees, the maneuver of shutting up the doors between
   seven and eight o'clock, and circulating the report of adjourning, and
   finishing the next morning, by which several were deceived,-it so
   happened, I say, that on casting up the tickets, the first in numbers on
   the dependent side, and the first on the independent side, viz. Clymer and
   Allen, were a tie: 923 each.22

   To the description which I have already given of those who are against us,
   I may add, that they have neither associated nor assisted, or but very few
   of them; that they are a collection of different bodies blended by
   accident, having no natural relation to each other; that they have agreed
   rather out of spite than right; and that, as they met by chance, they will
   dissolve away again for the want of a cement.

   On our side, our object was single, our cause was one; wherefore, we
   cannot separate, neither will we separate. We have stood the experiment of
   the election, for the sake of knowing the men who were against us. Alas,
   what are they? One half of them ought to be now asking public pardon for
   their former offences; and the other half may think themselves well off
   that they are let alone. When the enemy enters the country, can they
   defend themselves? Or will they defend themselves? And if not, are they so
   foolish as to think that, in times like these, when it is our duty to
   search the corrupted wound to the bottom, that we, with ten times their
   strength and number (if the question were put to the people at large) will
   submit to be governed by cowards and Tories?

   He that is wise will reflect, that the safest asylum, especially in times
   of general convulsion when no settled form of government prevails, is, the
   love of the people. All property is safe under their protection. Even in
   countries where the lowest and most licentious of them have risen into
   outrage they have never departed from the path of natural honor.
   Volunteers unto death in defence of the person or fortune of those who had
   served or defended them, division of property never entered the mind of
   the populace. It is incompatible with that spirit which impels them into
   action. An avaricious mob was never heard of; nay, even a miser pausing in
   the midst of them, and catching their spirit, would from that instant
   cease to be covetous.

   I shall conclude this letter with remarking, that the English fleet and
   army have of late gone upon a different plan of operation to what they
   first set out with; for instead of going against those colonies where
   independence prevails most, they go against those only where they suppose
   it prevails least. They have quitted Massachusetts Bay and gone to North
   Carolina, supposing they had many friends there. Why are they expected at
   New York? But because they imagine the inhabitants are not generally
   independents (yet that province hath a large share of virtue,
   notwithstanding the odium which its House of Assembly brought upon it).
   From which I argue that the electing the king's attorney for a burgess of
   this city, is a fair invitation for them to come here; and in that case,
   will those who have invited them turn out to repulse them? I suppose not,
   for in their 923 votes there will not be found more than sixty armed men,
   perhaps not so many. Wherefore, should such an event happen, which
   probably will, I here give my first vote to levy the expense attending the
   expedition against them, on the estates of those who have invited them.

   THE FORESTER.

   1. The writer intended at first to have contained his remarks in one
   letter.-Author.

      

   2.  In his second letter "Cato" devoted considerable space to a
   communication entitled "On sending Commissioners to treat with the
   Congress" signed by "Cassandra."-Editor.

   3. The committee referred to by Paine was appointed by the Pennsylvania
   Assembly in response to a recommendation by the Continental Congress. It
   summoned a Provincial Convention which changed the entire political
   structure in Pennsylvania.-Editor.

   4. In the battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, North Carolina, the Tories were
   defeated and their temporary commander, M'Leod, fell "pierced with twenty
   balls."-Editor.

   5. The reference is to David Rittenhouse, Paine's close friend.-Editor.

   6. Paine is referring to Dr. Smith's An Oration in memory of General
   Montgomery, and of the Officers who fell with him, December 31, 1775,
   before Quebec; drawn up (and delivered February 19th, 1776,) at the desire
   of the Honourable Continental Congress. It was printed in Philadelphia and
   reprinted in London.-Editor.

   7. This was the Tory device of blaming the movement for independence upon
   foreign agitators. Since Dr. William Smith was himself a Scotchman it must
   have aroused some laughter among the readers of "Cato's" letter.-Editor.

   8.  Donald M'Donald was Brigadier-General of the Highlanders who went down
   to defeat at Moore's Creek Bridge on February 27, 1776.-Editor.

   9. The reference is to Plain Truth: addressed to the Inhabitants of
   America, containing Remarks on a late pamphlet, intitled Comon Sense: etc.
   Written by CANDIDUS. Will ye turn from flattery and attend to this side?
   For evidence that Dr. Smith was also the author of this pamphlet, see Paul
   Leicester Ford, "The Authorship of 'Plain Truth,' " in Pennsylvania
   Magazine of History and Biography, vol. XII, pp. 421-425.-Editor,

   10. As this piece may possibly fall into the hands of some who are not
   acquainted with the word soliloquy, for their information the sense of it
   is given, viz. "talking to one's self."-Author.

   11. Allen was a leading opponent of independence in Philadelphia.-Editor.

   12. Allan Ramsay, a famous Scotch poet of genuine wit and humor.-Author.

   13. It is a strange thing that Cato cannot be taught to distinguish
   between peace and union.-Author.)

   14. .Lord Clive, the chief of Eastern plunderers, received the thanks of
   Parliament for "his honorable conduct in the East Indies."-Author.

   15. The following is an instance of Cato's method of conducting an
   argument: "If hereditary succession, says Common Sense {meaning succession
   of monarchial governments), did ensure a race of good and wise men, it
   would have the seal of divine authority"; "thus we find him," says Cato,
   "with his own hand affixing the seal of heaven to what he before told us
   the Devil invented and the Almighty entered his protest against.' Cato's
   7th letter.-This is a strange argument indeed, Cato, or rather it is no
   argument at all, for hereditary succession does not ensure a race of good
   and wise men, consequently has not the seal of divine authority."-Author.

   16. Cato and I differ materially in our opinion of committees; I consider
   them as the only constitutional bodies at present in this province, and
   that for the following reason; they were duly elected by the people, and
   cheerfully do the' service for which they were elected. The House of
   Assembly were likewise elected by the people, but do the business for
   which they were not elected. Their authority is truly unconstitutional,
   being self-created. My charge is as a body, and not as
   individuals.-Author.

   17. Forget not the hapless African.-Author.

   18. The Quakers in 1704 who then made up the whole house of assembly [in
   Pennsylvania] zealously guarded their own and the people's rights against
   the encroaching power of the Proprietor, who nevertheless submitted them
   by finding means to abolish the original charter and introduce another, of
   which they complained in the following words. "And then by a subtle
   contrivance and artifice 'of thine,' laid deeper than the capacities of
   some could fathom, or the circumstances of many could admit time to
   consider of, a way was found out to lay the first charter aside and
   introduce another."-Query. Would these men have elected the proprietary
   persons which you have done?-Author.

   19. The reference is to those individuals who opposed American
   independence.-Editor.

   20. The reference is to opponents of American independence.-Editor.

   21. This distinction will be more fully explained in some future
   letter.-Author,

   22. Mr. Samuel Howell, though on their ticket, was never considered by us
   a proprietary dependent.-Author.
