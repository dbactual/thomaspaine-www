   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.

   Philadelphia, March 4, '79

   DEAR SIR:

   I wrote you twice from York Town in June 78, but have not received a line
   from you since yours of Feb. 7th, 77 by Capt. Folger.

   I have lately met with a turn, which, sooner or later, happens to all men
   in popular life, that is, I fell, all at once, from high credit to
   disgrace, and the worst word was thought too good for me. But so sudden is
   the revolution of public opinion that the same cause which produced the
   fall recovered me from it.

   Mr. Deane is here. He is certainly not the man you supposed him to be when
   you wrote your recommendatory letters of him. He published a most
   Inflammatory address in the news-papers of the 5th of Decr. last, which,
   by the means of a party formed to support it, obtained such an ascendancy
   over all ranks of People, that the infatuation was surprising. He
   introduced it by saying that "the Ears of the Representatives were shut
   against him" This declaration, tho' very unjustly made, gave pretence
   to the Publication. The clamor against Congress was violent, and as I saw
   no prospect of it abating, I gave, after ten days, an answer to it; hoping
   thereby to stay the rage of the Public till the matter could be calmly
   understood. I shared the same fate with Congress, and was set down for a
   pensioned writer, and most furiously abused both in the newspapers and
   everywhere else; and what may perhaps appear extraordinary, I was at the
   same time attacked by Congress, as if they, or a majority of them, wished
   the Imposition to pass. I had suspicions of Mr. Deane which others had
   not. I compared his single letters with the joint letters of the
   Commissioners and other letters and found such a disagreement as could not
   be honestly accounted for. To support Mr. Deane the affair of the supplies
   from Mr. B &mdash; was brought up and Mr. Deane's merit in procuring them was
   represented equal to that of the Savior of the country. I had at the same
   time my suspicions concerning the loss of the dispatches, and the purpose
   for which they were lost, as you will fully see by the enclosed, to which
   no answer has been given, and the Torrent has taken a direct contrary
   turn. The dispute has been a disagreeable one, but the Imposition had it
   passed would have been still worse, and it will serve to shew to the Enemy
   that the Congress are not the absolute leaders of America.

   Mr. Deane and those who at first supported him constantly endeavored to
   involve all his affairs with yours in such a manner as to admit of no
   Separation. I, who have carefully read all the letters can best see where
   they meet and where they are distinct. His Agency before you arrived is
   one thing, and his joint commission with you afterwards is quite another
   thing. Mr. Beache exceedingly surprised me one day, by telling me, that
   he supposed I intended to attack you after I had done with Mr. Deane. From
   what he could draw such an inference I cannot conceive as I have
   constantly studied to keep Mr. D's agency distinct from the joint
   Commission. I have always had my Eye to the issue, that turn out as it
   would, you might not be unjustly involved in it. Mr. Deane's connection
   shelter him under you for support &mdash; and there may be others, not your
   friends, for every man has his enemies, who would likewise tack you to him
   to share any discredit that might fall on him. I have endeavored to keep
   you clear from both these dangers &mdash; When I say that there may be others,
   not your friends, &c., I have no particular authority for saying it; but
   it being the natural consequence of parties, I have endeavored to guard
   against the probability of any such Injury. I have never heard a syllable of
   disrepute towards you from either of the Col Lee's, or any of Mr.
   Izard's connections. They know my attachment to you, and I have taken
   every care to show by a comparison of things dates and letters, that you
   were not privy to such parts of Mr. Deane's conduct as may be found
   censurable. I really believe he has made mischief between friends to serve
   himself. I can account for the difference between the commissioners upon
   no other plan. I have had a most exceeding rough time of it; But the Scale
   of Affairs is now entirely turned as to the Public Sentiment.

   I am Dear Sir your affectionate Friend and humble Servt

   THOS PAINE

   P. S. I sent in my resignation as Secretary to the Com Foreign
   Affairs Jan. 8th. &mdash; My compliments to your grandsons.
