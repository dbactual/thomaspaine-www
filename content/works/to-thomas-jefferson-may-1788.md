   May 1788

   Your saying last evening that Sir Isaac Newtons principle of Gravitation
   would not explain, or could not apply as a rule to find the quantity of
   the attraction of cohesion, and my replying that I never could comprehend
   any meaning in the term "attraction of cohesion," the result must be, that
   either I have a dull comprehension, or that the term does not admit of
   comprehension &mdash; It appears to me an attenation Jumble of words &mdash; 
   each of which admits of a clear and distinct Idea, 
   but of no Idea at all when compounded.

   The immense difference there is between the attracting power of two
   Bodies. At the least possible difference the mind is capable of
   conceiving, and the great power that instantly takes place to resist
   separation when the two Bodies are incorporated prove, to me, that there
   is something else to be considered in the case than can be comprehended by
   attraction or gravitation &mdash; yet this matter appears 
   sufficiently luminous to me according to my own line of Ideas.

   Attraction is to matter what desire is to the mind but cohesion is an
   entire different thing produced by an entire different cause &mdash; 
   It is the effect of the figure of matter &mdash; 

   Take two Iron hooks, the one strongly magnetical and bring them to touch
   each other, and a very little force will separate them (PICTURE OMITTED)
   for they are held together only by attraction.

   But their figure renders them capable of holding each other infinitely
   more powerful to resist separation than what attraction can; by hooking
   the (PICTURE OMITTED)
   
   Now if we suppose the particles of matter to have figure capable of
   interlocking and embracing each other we shall have a clear distinct Idea
   between cohesion and attraction and that they are things totally distinct
   from each other and arise from as different causes.

   The welding of two pieces of Iron appears to me no other then entangling
   the particles in much the same manner as turning a key within the works of
   a lock, and if our eyes were good enough we should see how it was 
   done &mdash; 

   I recollect a scene at one of the Theatres that very well explain the
   difference between attraction and cohesion &mdash; 
   
   A Condemned Lady wished to see
   her child and the child its mother &mdash; this call attraction &mdash; 
   They were admitted to meet, but when ordered to part they threw their 
   arms round each other and fastened their persons together. This is 
   what I mean by cohesion &mdash; which is a mechanical contact of the 
   figures of their persons as I believe all cohesion is &mdash; 

   Tho' the term "*attraction of cohesion*" has always appeared to me like
   the athanasion Creed &mdash; yet I think I can help the 
   Philosopher to a better
   explanation of it than what they give themselves &mdash; 
   which is, to suppose the
   attraction to continue in such a direction as to produce the mechanical
   interlocking of the figure of the particles of the bodies attracted &mdash; 

   Then. Suppose &mdash; a male and female screw lying on a 
   table and attracting each
   other with a force capable of drawing them together &mdash; 
   The direction of the
   attracting power to be a right line till screws begin to touch each other
   and then if the direction of the attracting power to be circular the
   screws will be screwed together &mdash; but even in this explanation, the
   cohesion is mechanical, and the attraction serves only to produce the
   contact &mdash; 

   While I consider attraction is a quality of matter capable of acting at a
   distance from the visible presence of matter, I have as clear an Idea of
   it as I can have of invisible things. 
   
   And while I consider cohesion as the
   mechanical interlocking of particles of matter, I can conceive the
   possibility of it much easier than I can attraction &mdash; because I can by
   crooking my fingers see figures that will interlock &mdash; but no 
   visible figure
   can explain attraction &mdash; therefore to endeavour to explain the less
   difficulty by the greater appears to me unphilosophical. &mdash; The cohesion
   which others attribute to attraction and which they cannot explain, I
   attribute to figures which I can explain &mdash; 

   A Number of fish hooks attracting and moving towards each other will show
   me there is such a thing as attraction but I see not how it is 
   performed &mdash; but their figurative hooking
   together shews cohesion visibly &mdash; and a handful of fish hooks thrown
   together in a heap explain cohesion better than all the Newtonian
   Philosophy &mdash; It is with gravitation 
   as it is with all new discoveries, it is applied to explain too many things.

   It is a rainy morning and I am waiting for Mr. Parker, and in the
   mean time, having nothing else to do I have amused myself with writing
   this &mdash;

   T PAINE &mdash;
