   To a French Minister  August 13, 1796

   VERSAILLES,

   CITIZEN MINISTER:

   The citizen Robert Smith, a very particular friend of mine, wishes to
   obtain a passport to go to Hamburg, and I will be obliged to you to do him
   that favor. Himself and family have lived several years in France, for he
   likes neither the government nor the climate of England. He has large
   property in England, but his Banker in that country has refused sending
   him remittances. This makes it necessary for him to go to Hamburg, because
   from there he can draw his money out of his Banker's hands, which he
   cannot do whilst in France. His family remains in France.

   Salut et fraternite.

   THOMAS PAINE.
