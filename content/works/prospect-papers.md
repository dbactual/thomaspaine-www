   The articles below are from *The Prospect Magazine*, started by Elihu Palmer, and to which Paine 
   contributed 13 essays. Four essays in this collection below are deattributed works: 
   "Of Cain and Abel" (Palmer is the author), "Of the Old and New Testaments" (author unknown), 
   "To the Members of the Society"(unknown), and "On the Sabbath Day in Connecticut"(unknown). 
   However we left them in this collection from the *Prospect*.
   
   Here is a typical test of many on each of the deattributed articles:

   From the February 18, 1804 *Prospect* issue:

   ROBERT HALL, a Protestant minister in England, preached and published a
   sermon against what he called "*Modern Infidelity*." A copy of it was sent to
   a gentleman in America, with a request for his opinion thereon. That
   gentleman sent it to a friend of his in New-York, with the request written
   on the cover &mdash; and this last sent it to Thomas Paine, who wrote
   the following observations on the blank leaf at the end of the Sermon.
   
   REMARKS ON THE FOREGOING SERMON.

   The preacher of the foregoing sermon speaks a great deal about *infidelity*,
   but does not define what he means by it. His harangue is a general
   exclamation. Everything, I suppose, that is not in his creed is infidelity
   with him, and his creed is infidelity with me. Infidelity is believing
   falsely. If what christians believe is not true, it is the christians that
   are the infidels.

   The point between deists and christians is not about doctrine, but about
   fact &mdash; for if the things believed by the christians to be facts, are not
   facts, the doctrine founded thereon falls of itself. There is such a book
   as the bible, but is it a fact that the bible is *revealed religion*? The
   christians cannot prove it is. They put tradition in place of evidence,
   and tradition is not proof. If it were, the reality of witches could be
   proved by the same kind of evidence.

   The bible is a history of the times of which it speaks, and history is not
   revelation. The obscene and vulgar stories in the bible are as repugnant
   to our ideas of the purity of a divine Being, as the horrid cruelties and
   murders it ascribes to him, are repugnant to our ideas of His justice. It
   is the reverence of the *Deists* for the attributes of the DEITY, that causes
   them to reject the bible.

   Is the account which the christian church gives of the person called Jesus
   Christ, a fact or a fable? Is it a fact that he was begotten by the holy
   Ghost? The christians cannot prove it, for the case does not admit of
   proof. The things called miracles in the bible, such, for instance as raising the
   dead, admitted, *if true*, of occular demonstration, but the story of the
   conception of Jesus Christ in the womb is a case beyond miracle, for it
   did not admit of demonstration. Mary, the reputed mother of Jesus, who must be supposed to know best,
   never said so herself, and all the evidence of it is, that the book of
   Matthew says, that Joseph dreamed an angel told him so. Had an old maid two
   or three hundred years of age, brought forth a child, it would have been
   much better presumptive evidence of a supernatural conception than
   Matthew's story of Joseph's dream about his young wife.

   Is it a fact that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world, and how is
   it proved? If a God, he could not die, and as a man he could not redeem,
   how then is this redemption proved to be fact? It is said that Adam eat of
   the forbidden fruit, commonly called an apple, and thereby subjected
   himself and all his posterity for ever to eternal damnation. &mdash; This is 
   worse than visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto
   *the third and fourth generations*. But how was the death of Jesus Christ to
   affect or alter the case? &mdash; Did God thirst for blood? If so, would it not
   have been better to have crucified Adam at once upon the forbidden tree,
   and made a new man? Would not this have been more creator like than
   repairing the old one? Or did God, when He made Adam, supposing the story to be true, exclude
   Himself from the right of making another? Or impose on himself the
   necessity of breeding from the old stock? Priests should first prove
   facts and deduce doctrines from them afterwards. But instead of this they
   assume every thing and prove nothing. Authorities drawn from the bible are
   no more than authorities drawn from other books, unless it can be proved
   that the bible is revelation.

   The story of the redemption will not stand examination. That man should
   redeem himself from the sin of eating an apple by committing a murder on
   Jesus Christ, is the strangest system of religion ever set up. Deism is
   perfect purity compared with this. It is an established principle with the Quakers 
   not to shed blood &mdash; suppose
   then all Jerusalem had been quakers when Christ lived, there would have
   been nobody to crucify him, and in that case, if man is redeemed by his
   blood, which is the belief of the church, there could have been no
   redemption &mdash; and the people of Jerusalem must all have been damned because
   they were too good to commit murder. The christian system of religion is
   an outrage on common sense. Why is man afraid to think?

   Why do not the christians, to be consistent, make saints of Judas and
   Pontius Pilate, for they were the persons who accomplished the acts of
   salvation. The merit of a sacrifice, if there can be any merit in it, was
   never in the thing sacrificed, but in the persons offering up the
   sacrifice &mdash; and therefore Judas and Pontius Pilate ought to stand first
   on the calendar of saints.

   From the March 3, 1804 *Prospect* issue:

   OF THE WORD RELIGION, AND OTHER WORDS OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICATION.

   The word *religion* is a word of forced application when used with respect
   to the worship of God. The root of the word is the Latin verb *ligo*, to tie
   or bind. From *ligo*, comes *religo*, to tie or bind over again, to make more
   fast &mdash; from *religo*, comes the substantive *religio*, which with the addition
   of n makes the English substantive religion.  The French use the word properly &mdash;  
   when a woman enters a convent she is
   called a *noviciate*, that is, she is upon trial or probation. When she
   takes the oath, she is called a *religieuse*, that is, she is tied or bound
   by that oath to the performance of it. We use the word in the same kind of
   sense when we say we will religiously perform the promise that we make.

   But the word, without referring to its etymology has, in the manner it is
   used, no definite meaning, because it does not designate what religion a
   man is of. There is the religion of the Chinese, of the Tartars, of the
   Bramins, of the Persians, of the Jews, of the Turks, &c.

   The word *christianity* is equally as vague as the word religion. No two
   sectaries can agree what it is. It is *lo here* and *lo there*. The two
   principal sectaries, Papists and Protestants, have often cut each other's
   throats about it: &mdash; The papists call the protestants heretics, and the protestants call the
   papists idolators. The minor sectaries have shewn the same spirit of
   rancour, but as the civil law restrains them from blood, they content
   themselves with preaching damnation against each other.

   The word *protestant* has a positive signification in the sense it is used.
   It means protesting against the authority of the Pope, and this is the
   only article in which the protestants agree. In every other sense, with
   respect to religion, the word protestant, is as vague as the word
   christian. When we say an episcopalian, a presbyterian, a baptist, a quaker, we know
   what those persons are, and what tenets they hold &mdash; but when we say a
   christian we know he is not a Jew nor a Mahometan, but we know not if
   he be a trinitarian or an anti-trinitarian, a believer in what is called
   the immaculate conception or a disbeliever, a man of seven sacraments, or
   of two sacraments, or of none. The word christian describes what a man
   is not, but not what he is.

   The word *Theology*, from *Theos*, the Greek word for God, and meaning the
   study and knowledge of God, is a word, that strictly speaking, belongs to
   Theists or Deists, and not to the christians. The head of the christian
   church is the person called Christ &mdash; but the head of the church of the
   Theists, or Deists, as they are more commonly called, from *Deus*, the Latin
   word for God, is God himself, and therefore the word Theology belongs
   to that church which has Theos or God for its head, and not to the
   christian church which has the person called Christ for its head. Their
   technical word is *christianity* and they cannot agree on what christianity
   is.

   The words *revealed religion* and *natural religion*, require also explanation.
   They are both invented terms, contrived by the church for the support of
   priest-craft. With respect to the first, there is no evidence of any such
   thing, except in the universal revelation, that God has made of his power,
   his wisdom, his goodness, in the structure of the universe, and in all the
   works of creation. We have no cause for ground from any thing we behold in those works, to
   suppose God would deal partially by mankind, and reveal knowledge to one
   nation and withhold it from another, and then damn them for not knowing
   it. The sun shines an equal quantity of light all over the world &mdash; and
   mankind in all ages and countries are endued with reason, and blessed with
   sight, to read the visible works of God in the creation, and so
   intelligent is this book that *he that runs may read*. We admire the wisdom of 
   the ancients, yet they had no bibles nor books
   called revelation. They cultivated the reason that God gave them,
   studied him in His works, and arose to eminence.

   As to the Bible, whether true or fabulous, it is a history, and history 
   is not revelation. If Solomon had seven hundred wives, and three
   hundred concubines, and if Samson slept in Delila's lap, and she cut his
   hair off, the relation of those things is mere history that needed no
   revelation from heaven to tell it; neither does it need any revelation to
   tell us that Samson was a fool for his pains and Solomon too.

   As to the expressions so often used in the bible, that *the word of the
   Lord*, came to such an one, or such an one, it was the fashion of speaking
   in those times, like the expression used by a quaker, that the *spirit
   moveth him*, or that used by priests, that they *have a call*. We ought not
   to be deceived by phrases because they are ancient. But if we admit the
   supposition that God would condescend to reveal himself in words, we ought
   not to believe it would be in such idle and profligate stories as are in
   the bible, and it is for this reason, among others which our reverence to
   God inspires, that the Deists deny that the book called the bible is the
   word of God, or that it is revealed religion.

   With respect to the term, *natural religion*, it is upon the face of it, the
   opposite of artificial religion, and it is impossible for any man to be
   certain that what is called *revealed religion* is not artificial. Man has 
   the power of making books, inventing stories of God, and calling
   them revelation or the Word of God. The Koran exists as an instance that
   this can be done, and we must be credulous indeed to suppose that this is
   the only instance, and Mahomet the only impostor. The Jews could match him,
   and the church of Rome could overmatch the Jews. The Mahometans believe
   the Koran, the Christians believe the Bible, and it is education makes all
   the difference.

   Books, whether Bibles or Korans, carry no evidence of being the work of
   any other power than man. It is only that which man cannot do that carries
   the evidence of being the work of a superior power. Man could not invent
   and make a universe &mdash; he could not invent nature, for nature is of divine
   origin. It is the laws by which the universe is governed. When, therefore, we 
   look through nature up to nature's God, we are in the
   right road of happiness, but when we trust to books as the word of God,
   and confide in them as revealed religion, we are afloat on the ocean of
   uncertainty, and shatter into contending factions. The term, therefore,
   *natural religion*, explains itself to be *divine religion*, and the term
   *revealed religion* involves in it the suspicion of being *artificial*.

   To shew the necessity of understanding the meaning of words, I will
   mention an instance of a minister, I believe of the episcopalian church of
   Newark, in Jersey. He wrote and published a book, and entitled it,
   "*An Antidote to Deism*." An antidote to *Deism* must be *Atheism*. It has no
   other antidote &mdash; for what can be an antidote to the belief of a God, but
   the disbelief of God. Under the tuition of such pastors, what but
   ignorance and false information can be expected?

   *T.P.*


   OF CAIN AND ABEL (Editor's Note: this article has not been edited for accuracy.)

   The story of Cain and Abel is told in Genesis iv. Cain was the elder
   brother and Abel the younger, and Cain killed Abel. The Egyptian story of
   Typhon and Osiris, and the Jewish story in Genesis of Cain and Abel, have
   the appearance of being the same story differently told, and that it came
   originally from Egypt.

   In the Egyptian story, Typhon and Osiris are brothers; Typhon is the elder
   and Osiris the younger, and Typhon kills Osiris. The story is an allegory
   on Darkness and Light: Typhon, the elder brother, is Darkness because
   Darkness was supposed to be more ancient than Light: Osiris is the Good
   Light who rules during the summer months, and brings forth the fruits of
   the earth, and is the favorite, as Abel is said to have been; for which
   Typhon hates him; and when the winter comes, and cold and darkness
   overspread the earth, Typhon is represented as having killed Osiris out of
   malice, as Cain is said to have killed Abel.

   The two stories are alike in their circumstances and their event, and are
   probably but the same story. What corroborates this opinion is that the
   fifth chapter of Genesis historically contradicts the reality of the story
   of Cain and Abel in the fourth chapter; for though the name of Seth, a son
   of Adam, is mentioned in the fourth chapter, he is spoken of in the fifth
   chapter as if he was the first born of Adam. The chapter begins thus:

   "This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created
   man, in the likeness of God created He him; male and female created he
   them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they
   were created. And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son,
   in his own likeness and after his image, and called his name Seth." The
   rest of the chapter goes on with the genealogy.

   Anybody reading this chapter cannot suppose there were any sons born
   before Seth. The chapter begins with what is called the creation of Adam,
   and calls itself the book of the generations of Adam, yet no mention is
   made of such persons as Cain and Abel.

   One thing however is evident on the face of these two chapters, which  is
   that the same person is not the writer of both; the most blundering
   historian could not have committed himself in such a manner.

   Though I look on everything in the first ten chapters of Genesis to be
   fiction, yet fiction historically told should be consistent; whereas these
   two chapters are not. The Cain and Abel of Genesis appear to be no other
   than the ancient Egyptian story of Typhon and Osiris, the Darkness and the
   Light, which answered very well as an allegory without being believed as a
   fact.

   From the March 24, 1804 *Prospect* issue:

   THE TOWER OF BABEL

   The story of the tower of Babel is told in the eleventh chapter of Genesis. It begins thus. &mdash; 
   "And the whole earth (it was but a very little part of it they knew) was
   of one language and of one speech. &mdash; And it came to pass, as they journeyed
   from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they
   dwelt there. &mdash; And they said one to another, *Go to*, let us make brick and
   burn them thoroughly, and they had brick for stone, and slime had they for
   mortar. &mdash; And they said, *Go to*, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top may
   reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad
   upon the face of the whole earth. &mdash; And the Lord came down to see the city
   and the tower which the children of men builded. &mdash; And the Lord said, behold 
   the people is one, and they have all one
   language, and this they begin to do, and now nothing will be restrained
   from them which they have imagined to do. &mdash; *Go to*, let us go down and there
   confound their language, that they may not understand one another's
   speech. &mdash; So (that is, by that means) the Lord scattered them abroad from thence
   upon the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city."

   This is the story, and a very foolish inconsistent story it is. In the
   first place, the familiar and irreverend manner in which the almighty is
   spoken of in this chapter is offensive to a serious mind. As to the project 
   of building a tower whose top should reach to heaven,
   there never could be a people so foolish as to have such a notion; but to
   represent the Almighty as jealous of the attempt, as the writer of the
   story has done, is adding profanation to folly. &mdash; "*Go to*," says the builders,
   "let us build us a tower whose top shall reach to heaven. *Go to,* says
   God, let us go down and confound their language." This quaintness is indecent, 
   and the reason given for it is worse, for,
   "now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do."
   This is representing the Almighty as jealous of their getting into heaven.
   The story is too ridiculous, even as a fable, to account for the diversity
   of languages in the world, for which it seems to have been intended.

   As to the project of confounding their language for the purpose of making
   them separate, it is altogether inconsistent; because, instead of producing
   this effect, it would, by increasing their difficulties, render them more
   necessary to each other, and cause them to keep together. Where could they
   go to better themselves?

   Another observation upon this story is, the inconsistency of it with
   respect to the opinion that the Bible is the Word of God given for the
   information of mankind; for nothing could so effectually prevent such a
   word from being known by mankind as confounding their language. The
   people, who after this spoke different languages, could no more understand
   such a word generally, than the builders of Babel could understand one
   another. It would have been necessary, therefore, had such word ever been
   given or intended to be given, that the whole earth should be, as they say
   it was at first, of one language and of one speech, and that it should
   never have been confounded.

   The case however is, that the bible will not bear examination in any
   part of it, which it would do if it was the word of God. Those who most
   believe it are those who know least about it, and priests always take care
   to keep the inconsistent and contradictory parts out of sight.

   T. P.
   
   

   From the June 30, and July 7, 1804 *Prospect* issues:

   Of the Religion of Deism compared with the Christian Religion, and the superiority of the former over the latter.
   
   Every person, of whatever religious denomination he may be is a DEIST in
   the first article of his Creed. Deism from the Latin word Deus, God, is
   the belief of a God, and this belief is the first article of every man's
   creed.

   It is on this article, universally consented to by all mankind, that the
   Deist builds his church, and here he rests. Whenever we step aside from
   this article, by mixing it with articles of human invention, we wander
   into a labyrinth of uncertainty and fable, and become exposed to every
   kind of imposition by pretenders to revelation. The Persian shews the *Zendavista* 
   of Zoroaster the lawgiver of Persia, and calls it the *divine law*; the Bremen shews the *shaster*, 
   revealed, he says by God to Brama, and given to him out of a cloud; the Jew shews what
   he calls the law of Moses, given, he says, by God on the Mount Sinai; the
   Christian shews a collection of books and epistles written by nobody
   knows who, and called the New Testament, and the Mahometan shews the
   Koran, given, he says, by God to Mahomet; each of these calls itself
   *revealed religion*, and the *only* true Word of God, and this the followers
   of each profess to believe from the habit of education, and each believes
   the others are imposed upon.

   But when the divine gift of reason begins to expand itself in the mind and
   calls man to reflection, he then reads and contemplates God and his works
   and not in the books pretending to be revelation. The Creation is the
   bible of the true believer in God. Every thing in this vast volume inspires
   him with sublime ideas of the Creator. The little and paltry, and often
   obscene, tales of the bible sink into wretchedness when put in comparison
   with this mighty work. The Deist needs none of those tricks and shows called miracles to confirm
   his faith, for what can be a greater miracle than the creation itself and
   his own existence.

   There is a happiness in Deism, when rightly understood, that is not to be
   found in any other system of religion. All other systems have something in
   them that either shock our reason or are repugnant to it, and man, if he
   thinks at all, must stifle his reason in order to force himself to believe
   them. But in Deism our reason and our belief become happily united. The
   wonderful structure of the universe and every thing we behold in the
   system of the creation prove to us, far better than books can do, the
   existence of a God, and at the same time proclaim his attributes. It is 
   by the exercise of our reason that we are enabled to contemplate God
   in His works, and imitate him in his ways. When we see his care and
   goodness extended over all his creatures, it teaches us our duty toward
   each other, while it calls forth our gratitude to him. It is by forgetting
   God in his works, and running after the books of pretended revelation
   that man has wandered from the strait path of duty and happiness, and
   become by turns the victim of doubt and the dupe of delusion.

   Except in the first article in the Christian creed, that of believing in
   God, there is not an article in it but fills the mind with doubt as to the
   truth of it the instant man begins to think. Now every article in a creed
   that is necessary to the happiness and salvation of man ought to be as
   evident to the reason and comprehension of man as the first article is,
   for God has not given us reason for the purpose of confounding us, but
   that we should use it for our own happiness and his glory.

   The truth of the first article is proved by God himself and is universal,
   for *the creation is of itself demonstration of the existence of a Creator*.
   But the second article, that of God's begetting a son, is not proved in
   like manner, and stands on no other authority than that of tale. Certain books in 
   what is called the New Testament tell us that Joseph
   dreamed that the angel told him so. (Matthew chap. 1, v. 20) "And behold the angel
   of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Joseph thou son of
   David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is
   conceived in her is of the holy ghost." The evidence upon this article bears no comparison with the evidence upon
   the first article, and therefore is not entitled to the same credit, and
   ought not to be made an article in a creed, because the evidence of it is
   defective, and what evidence there is, is doubtful and suspicious. We do
   not believe the first article on the authority of books, whether called
   Bibles or Korans, nor yet on the visionary authority of dreams, but on the
   authority of God's own visible works in the creation. The nations who never heard 
   of such books, nor of such people as Jews,
   Christians or Mahometans, believe the existence of a God as fully as we
   do, because it is self evident. The work of man's hands is a proof of the
   existence of man as fully as his personal appearance would be. When we see 
   a watch, we have as positive evidence of the existence of a
   watchmaker as if we saw him; and in like manner the creation is evidence
   to our reason and our senses of the existence of a Creator. But there is
   nothing in the works of God that is evidence that he begat a son, nor
   any thing in the system of creation that corroborates such an idea, and
   therefore, we are not authorised in believing it. What truth there may be in 
   the story that Mary, before she was married to
   Joseph, was kept by one of the Roman soldiers, and was with child by him,
   I leave to be settled between the Jews and the Christians. The story,
   however has probability on its side, for her husband Joseph suspected and
   was jealous of her, and was going to put her away. "Joseph her husband
   being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was going
   to put her away privately." (Matthew chap. I, v. 19).

   I have already said that "whenever we step aside from the first article
   (that of believing in God), we wander into a labyrinth of uncertainty,"
   and here is evidence of the justness of the remark, for it is impossible
   for us to decide who was Jesus Christ's father. But presumption can assume 
   any thing, and therefore it makes Joseph's dream
   to be of equal authority with the existence of God, and to help it on
   calls it revelation. It is impossible for the mind of man in its serious
   moments, however it may have been entangled by education, or beset by
   priest craft, not to stand still and doubt upon the truth of this article
   and of its creed. But this is not all.

   The second article of the Christian creed having
   brought the son of Mary into the world (and this Mary according to the
   Chronological tables, was a girl of only fifteen years of age when this
   son was born) the next article goes on to account for his being begotten,
   which was that when he grew a man he should be put to death, to expiate,
   they say, the sin that Adam brought into the world by eating an apple or
   some kind of forbidden fruit.

   But though this is the creed of the church of Rome, from whence the
   Protestants borrowed it, it is a creed which that Church has manufactured
   of itself, for it is not contained in, nor derived from, the book called
   the New Testament. The four books called the Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which
   give, or pretend to give, the birth, sayings, life, preaching, and death
   of Jesus Christ, make no mention of what is called the fall of man, nor is
   the name of Adam to be found in any of those books, which it certainly
   would be if the writers of them believed that Jesus was begotten, born, and
   died for the purpose of redeeming mankind from the sin which Adam had
   brought into the world. Jesus never speaks of Adam himself, of the Garden
   of Eden, nor of what is called the fall of man. Neither did the early 
   Christians believe the story of the fall of man to be fact, but held it 
   to be allegory. The person called St. Augustine, says in his City of God, 
   that the adventure of Eve and the serpent, and the account of Paradise, 
   were generally considered at the time as allegory, and he treats them as 
   such himself without attempting to give any explanation of them, but 
   thinks a better might be given than had been offered.
   
   Origen, another of the ancient fathers of the Church, treats the account 
   of the creation in Genesis, and the story of the Garden of Eden and the 
   fall of man, as fable or fiction.
   
   What man of good sense, says he, can ever persuade himself that there was 
   a first, a second, and a third day, and that each of those days had a night, 
   when there was yet neither sun, moon, nor stars! (N.B. According to the 
   account of Genesis, chap. I, the sun and moon was not made until the fourth 
   day) &mdash; What man, continues he can be stipid enough to believe that God 
   acting the part of gardener had planted a garden in the east; that the tree 
   of life  was a real tree, and that the fruit of it had the virtue of making 
   those who eat it live forever.
   
   The Jews did not believe the first chapters of Genisis to be fact. Muimonides, 
   one of the most learned and celebrated of the Jewish authors who lived in the 
   eleventh century, says, in is book MORE NEBACHIM. We ought not to understand nor take 
   according to the letter that which is written in the book of the creation, (the book of Genesis.) 
   Taken, says he, according to the letter, especially with respect to the work of four 
   days, it gives the most absurd and extravagant ideas of God.
   
   But the Church of Rome having set up its new religion, which it called
   Christianity, and invented the creed which it named the apostles's creed, in
   which it calls Jesus the *only son of God, conceived by the Holy Ghost, and
   born of the Virgin Mary*, things of which it is impossible that man or
   woman can have any idea, and consequently no belief but in words, and for
   which there is no authority but the idle story of Joseph's dream in the
   first chapter of Matthew, which any designing impostor or foolish fanatic
   might make, it then manufactured the allegories in the book of Genesis into fact, and
   the allegorical tree of life and the tree of knowledge into real trees,
   contrary to the belief of the first christians, and for which there is not
   the least authority in any of the books of the New Testament, for in none
   of them is there any mention made of such place as the Garden of Eden, nor
   of any thing that is said to have happened there.

   But the Church of Rome could not erect the person called Jesus into a
   Saviour of the World without making the allegories in the book of Genesis
   into fact, though the New Testament, as before observed, gives no
   authority for it. All at once the allegorical tree of knowledge became,
   according to the church, a real tree, the fruit of it real fruit, and the
   eating of it sinful. As priest-craft was always the enemy of knowledge, because priest craft
   supports itself by keeping people in delusion and ignorance, it was
   consistent with its policy to make the acquisition of knowledge a real
   sin.

   The church of Rome having done this, it then brings forward Jesus the son
   of Mary as suffering death to redeem mankind from sin, which Adam, it
   says, had brought into the world by eating the fruit of the tree of
   knowledge. But as it is impossible for reason to believe such a story,
   because it can see no reason for it, nor have any evidence of it, the
   church then tells us we must not regard our reason, but must *believe*, as
   it were, and that through thick and thin, as if God had given man reason
   like a plaything, or a rattle, on purpose to make fun of him. Reason is the 
   forbidden tree of priest-craft, and may serve to explain the
   allegory of the forbidden tree of knowledge, for we may reasonably suppose
   the allegory had some meaning and application at the time it was invented.
   It was the practice of the Eastern nations to convey their meaning by
   allegory, and relate it in the manner of fact. Jesus followed the same
   method, yet nobody ever supposed the allegory or parable of the Rich Man
   and Lazarus, the Prodigal Son, the Ten Virgins, &c. were facts. Why then 
   should the tree of knowledge, which is far more romantic in idea
   than the parables in the New Testament are, be supposed to be a real tree. 
   (The remark of the Emperor Julien, on the story of the Tree of Knowledge is
   worth observing. "If," said he, "there ever had been, or could be, a Tree
   of Knowledge, instead of God forbidding man to eat thereof, it would be
   that of which he would order him to eat the most.")  The answer to
   this is, because the Church could not make its new-fangled system, which
   is called Christianity, hold together without it. To have made Christ to
   die on account of an allegorical tree would have been too bare-faced a
   fable.

   But the account, as it is given of Jesus in the New Testament even
   visionary as it is, does not support the creed of the church that he died
   for the redemption of the world. According to that account he was
   crucified and buried on the Friday and rose again in good health on the
   Sunday morning, for we do not hear that he was sick. This cannot be called
   dying, and is rather making fun of death than suffering it. There are thousands 
   of men and women also, who if they could know they
   should come back again in good health in about thirty-six hours, would
   prefer such kind of death for the sake of the experiment, and to know what
   the other side of the grave was. Why then should that which would be only
   a voyage of curious amusement to us be magnified into merit and suffering
   in him? If a God he could not suffer death, for immortality cannot die,
   and as a man his death could be no more than the death of any other
   person.

   The belief of the redemption of Jesus Christ is altogether an invention of
   the church of Rome, not the doctrine of the New Testament. What the
   writers of the New Testament attempted to prove by the story of Jesus is,
   the *resurrection of the same body from the grave*, which was the belief of
   the Pharisees, in opposition to the Sadducees (a sect of Jews) who denied
   it. Paul, who was brought up a Pharisee, labours hard at this point for it, was
   the creed of his own Pharisaical Church. The XV chap, I of Corinthians is full of
   supposed cases and assertions about the resurrection of the same body, but
   there is not a word in it about redemption. This chapter makes part of the
   funeral services of the Episcopal church. The dogma of the redemption is the 
   fable of priest-craft invented since the
   time the New Testament was compiled, and the agreeable delusion of it
   suited with the depravity of immoral livers. When men are taught to
   ascribe all their crimes and vices to the temptations of the Devil, and to
   believe that Jesus, by his death, rubs all off and pays their passage to
   heaven gratis, they become as careless in morals as a spendthrift would be
   of money, were he told that his father had engaged to pay off all his
   scores. It is a doctrine not only dangerous to morals in this world, but to our
   happiness in the next world, because it holds out such a cheap, easy, and
   lazy way of getting to heaven as has a tendency to induce men to hug the
   delusion of it to their own injury.

   But there are times when men have serious thoughts, and it is at such
   times, when they begin to think, that they begin to doubt the truth of the
   Christian Religion, and well they may, for it is too fanciful and too full
   of conjecture, inconsistency, improbability, and irrationality, to afford
   consolation to the thoughtful man. His reason revolts against his
   creed. He sees that none of its articles are proved, or can be proved.
   He may believe that such a person as is called Jesus (for Christ was not
   his name) was born and grew to be a man, because it is no more than a
   natural and probable case. But who is to prove he is the son of God, that
   he was begotten by the Holy Ghost? Of these things there can be no proof,
   and that which admits not of proof, and is against the laws of probability
   and the order of nature, which God himself has established, is not an
   object for belief. God has not given man reason to embarrass him, but to
   prevent his being imposed upon.

   He may believe that Jesus was crucified, because many others were
   crucified, but who is to prove he was crucified *for the sins of the world*?
   This article has no evidence not even in the New Testament; and if it
   had, where is the proof that the New Testament, in relating things neither
   probable nor proveable, is to be believed as true? When an article in a 
   creed does not admit of proof nor of probability the
   salvo is to call it revelation; But this is only putting one difficulty in
   the place of another, for it is as impossible to prove a thing to be
   revelation as it is to prove that Mary was gotten with child by the Holy
   Ghost.

   Here it is that the religion of Deism is superior to the Christian
   religion. It is free from all those invented and torturing articles that
   shock our reason or injure our humanity, and with which the Christian
   religion abounds. Its creed is pure, and sublimely simple. It believes in
   God and there it rests. It honours reason as the choicest gift of God to man, and the faculty by
   which he is enabled to contemplate the power, wisdom, and goodness of the
   Creator displayed in the creation; and reposing itself on his protection,
   both here and hereafter, it avoids all presumptuous beliefs, and rejects,
   as the fabulous inventions of men, all books pretending to revelation.

   To THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY, STYLING ITSELF THE MISSIONARY SOCIETY
   
   (Editor's Note: This article has not been edited for accuracy, as it is not Paine's work.)

   The New York Gazette of the sixteenth (August) contains the following
   article-"On Tuesday, a committee of the Missionary Society, consisting
   chiefly of distinguished Clergymen, had an interview, at the City Hotel,
   with the chiefs of the Osage tribe of Indians, now in this city (New York)
   to whom they presented a Bible, together with an address, the object of
   which was to inform them that this good book contained the will and laws
   of the GREAT SPIRIT."

   It is to be hoped some humane person will, on account of our people on the
   frontiers, as well as of the Indians, undeceive them with respect to the
   present the missionaries have made them, and which they call a good book,
   containing, they say, the will and laws of the GREAT SPIRIT. Can those
   missionaries suppose that the assassination of men, women and children,
   and sucking infants, related in the books ascribed to Moses, Joshua, etc.,
   and blasphemously said to be done by the command of the Lord, the Great
   Spirit, can be edifying to our Indian neighbors, or advantageous to us?

   Is not the Bible warfare the same kind of warfare as the Indians
   themselves carry on, that of indiscriminate destruction, and against which
   humanity shudders? Can the horrid examples and vulgar obscenity with which
   the Bible abounds improve the morals or civilize the manners of the
   Indians? Will they learn sobriety and decency from drunken Noah and
   beastly Lot; or will their daughters be edified by the example of Lot's
   daughters?

   Will the prisoners they take in war be treated the better by their knowing
   the horrid story of Samuel's hewing Agag in pieces like a block of wood,
   or David's putting them under harrows of iron?

   Will not the shocking accounts of the destruction of the Canaanites, when
   the Israelites invaded their country, suggest the idea that we may serve
   them in the same manner, or the accounts stir them up to do the like to
   our people on the frontiers, and then justify the assassination by the
   Bible the missionaries have given them? Will those missionary societies
   never leave off doing mischief?

   In the accounts which this missionary committee give of their interview,
   they make the chief of the Indians to say, that, "as neither he nor his
   people could read it, he begged that some good white man might be sent to
   instruct them."

   It is necessary the general Government keep a strict eye over those
   missionary societies, who, under the pretense of instructing the Indians,
   send spies into their country to find out the best lands. No society
   should be permitted to have intercourse with the Indian tribes, nor send
   any person among them, but with the knowledge and consent of the
   Government.

   The present Administration has brought the Indians into a
   good disposition, and is improving them in the moral and civil comforts of
   life; but if these self-created societies be suffered to interfere, and
   send their speculating missionaries among them, the laudable object of
   government will be defeated. Priests, we know, are not remarkable for
   doing anything gratis; they have in general some scheme in everything they
   do, either to impose on the ignorant, or derange the operations of
   government.

   A FRIEND TO THE INDIANS.
   

   OF THE SABBATH-DAY IN CONNECTICUT
   
   (Editor's Note: This article has not been edited for accuracy, as it is not Paine's work.)

   The word Sabbath, means REST; that is, cessation from labor, but the
   stupid Blue Laws (They were called Blue Laws because they were originally
   printed on blue paper.-Author.) of Connecticut make a labor of rest, for
   they oblige a person to sit still from sunrise to sunset on a Sabbath-day,
   which is hard work. Fanaticism made those laws, and hypocrisy pretends to
   reverence them, for where such laws prevail hypocrisy will prevail also.

   One of those laws says, "No person shall run on a Sabbath-day, nor walk in
   his garden, nor elsewhere; but reverently to and from meeting." These
   fanatical hypocrites forgot that God dwells not in temples made with
   hands, and that the earth is full of His glory.

   One of the finest scenes and subjects of religious contemplation is to
   walk into the woods and fields, and survey the works of the God of the
   Creation. The wide expanse of heaven, the earth covered with verdure, the
   lofty forest, the waving corn, the magnificent roll of mighty rivers, and
   the murmuring melody of the cheerful brooks, are scenes that inspire the
   mind with gratitude and delight.

   But this the gloomy Calvinist of Connecticut must not behold on a
   Sabbath-day. Entombed within the walls of his dwelling, he shuts from his
   view the Temple of Creation. The sun shines no joy to him. The gladdening
   voice of nature calls on him in vain. He is deaf, dumb and blind to
   everything around that God has made. Such is the Sabbath-day of
   Connecticut.

   From whence could come this miserable notion of devotion? It comes from
   the gloominess of the Calvinistic creed. If men love darkness rather than
   light, because their works are evil, the ulcerated mind of a Calvinist,
   who sees God only in terror, and sits brooding over the scenes of hell and
   damnation, can have no joy in beholding the glories of the creation.
   Nothing in that mighty and wondrous system accords with his principles or
   his devotion.

   He sees nothing there that tells him that God created millions on purpose
   to be damned, and that the children of a span long are born to burn
   forever in hell. The creation preaches a different doctrine to this. We
   there see that the care and goodness of God is extended impartially over
   all the creatures He has made. The worm of the earth shares His protection
   equally with the elephant of the desert. The grass that springs beneath
   our feet grows by His bounty as well as the cedars of Lebanon.

   Everything in the creation reproaches the Calvinist with unjust ideas of
   God, and disowns the hardness and ingratitude of his principles. Therefore
   he shuns the sight of them on a Sabbath-day.

   AN ENEMY TO CANT AND IMPOSITION.
   
  

   OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT
   
   (Editor's Note: This article has not been edited for accuracy as it is not Paine's work.)

   Archbishop Tillotson says: "The difference between the style of the Old
   and New Testament is so remarkable, that one of the greatest sects in the
   primitive times, did, upon this very ground, found their heresy of two
   Gods, the one evil, fierce and cruel, whom they called the God of the Old
   Testament; the other good, kind and merciful, whom they called the God of
   the New Testament; so great a difference is there between the
   representations that are given of God in the books of the Jewish and
   Christian religion, as to give, at least, some color and pretense to an
   imagination of two Gods." Thus far Tillotson.

   But the case was that as the Church had picked out several passages from
   the Old Testament, which she most absurdly and falsely calls prophecies of
   Jesus Christ (whereas there is no prophecy of any such person, as anyone
   may see by examining the passages and the cases to which they apply), she
   was under the necessity of keeping up the credit of the Old Testament,
   because if that fell the other would soon follow, and the Christian system
   of faith would soon be at an end.

   As a book of morals, there are several parts of the New Testament that are
   good; but they are no other than what had been preached in the Eastern
   world several hundred years before Christ was born. Confucius, the Chinese
   philosopher, who lived five hundred years before the time of Christ, says,
   Acknowledge thy benefits by the return of benefits, but never revenge
   injuries.

   The clergy in Popish countries were cunning enough to know that if the Old
   Testament was made public, the fallacy of the New, with respect to Christ,
   would be detected, and they prohibited the use of it, and always took it
   away wherever they found it.

   The Deists, on the contrary, always encouraged the reading it, that people
   might see and judge for themselves, that a book so full of contradictions
   and wickedness could not be the Word of God, and that we dishonor God by
   ascribing it to Him.

   A TRUE DEIST.
   
   
   From the July 21, 1804 *prospect* issue:

   *Hints towards forming a Society for enquiring into the Truth or Falshood of Ancient History, 
   so far as History is connected with systems of Religion ancient and modern.*

   It has been customary to class History into three divisions, distinguished
   by the names of *Sacred, Profane* and Ecclesiastical. By the first is meant
   the *Bible*; by the second, the history of nations, of men and things; and
   by the third, the history of the church and its priesthood.

   Nothing is more easy than to give names, and therefore mere names
   signify nothing unless they lead to the discovery of some cause for which
   that name was given. For example, *Sunday* is the name given to the first
   day of the week, in the English language, and it is the same in the Latin,
   that is, it has the same meaning *(Dies Solis*), and also in the German and
   in several other languages. Why then was this name given to that day? Because it was the day dedicated
   by the ancient world to the luminary, which in the English we call the Sun,
   and therefore the day *Sun-day*, or the day of the Sun; as in the like
   manner we call the second day Monday, the day dedicated to the Moon.

   Here the name, *Sunday*, leads to the cause of its being called so, and we
   have visible evidence of the fact, because we behold the Sun from whence
   the name comes; but this is not the case when we distinguish one part of
   history from another by the name of *sacred.* All histories have been written 
   by men. We have no evidence, nor any cause
   to believe, that any have been written by God. That part of the Bible
   called the Old Testament, is the History of the Jewish nation, from the
   time of Abraham, which begins in the 11th chap. of Genesis to the downfall of that
   nation by Nebuchadnezar, and is no more entitled to be called sacred than
   any other history. It is altogether the contrivance of priestcraft that
   has given it that name. So far from its being *sacred* it has not the
   appearance of being true in many of the things it relates. It must be better
   authority than a book, which any impostor might make, as
   Mahomet made the Koran, to make a thoughtful man believe that the Sun and
   Moon stood still, or that Moses and Aaron turned the Nile, which is larger
   than the Delaware, into blood, and that the Egyptian magicians did the
   same. These things have too much the appearance of romance to be believed
   for fact.

   It would be of use to enquire, and ascertain the time, when that part of
   the Bible called the Old Testament first appeared. From all that can be
   collected there was no such book till after the Jews returned from
   captivity in Babylon, and that is the work of the Pharisees of the Second
   Temple. How they came to make the 19th chapter of the 2d book of King, and 
   the 37 of Isaiah, word for word alike, can only be accounted for by their 
   having no plan to go by, and not knowing what they were about. The same is 
   the case with respect to the last verses in the 2d book of Chronicles, and
   the first verses in Ezra, they also are word for word alike, which shews
   that the Bible has been put together at random.

   But besides these things there is great reason to believe we have been
   imposed upon, with respect to the antiquity of the bible, and especially
   with respect to the books ascribed to Moses. Herodotus, who is called the
   father of history, and is the most ancient historian whose works have
   reached to our time, and who traveled into Egypt, conversed with the
   priests, historians, astronomers and learned men of that country, for the
   purpose of obtaining all the information of it he could, and who gives an
   account of the ancient state of it, makes no mention of such a man as
   Moses, though the Bible makes him to have been the greatest hero there,
   nor of any one circumstance mentioned in the book of Exodus, respecting
   Egypt, such as turning the rivers into blood, the dust into lice, the
   death of the first born throughout all the land of Egypt, the passage of
   the Red Sea, the drowning of Pharaoh and all his host, things which could
   not have been a secret in Egypt, and must have been generally known, had
   they been facts; and therefore as no such things were known in Egypt,
   nor any such man as Moses at the time Herodotus was there, which is about
   two thousand two hundred years ago, it shews that the account of these things in the books
   ascribed to Moses is a made story of later times, that is, after the
   return of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity, and that Moses is not
   the author of the books ascribed to him.

   With respect to the cosmogony, or account of the creation, in the first chapter of Genesis,
   of the Garden of Eden in the second chapter, and of what is called the fall of man
   in the third chapter, there is something concerning them we are not historically
   acquainted with. In none of the books of the bible after Genesis, are any
   of these things mentioned, or even alluded to. How is this to be accounted for? 
   The obvious inference is, that either they
   were not known, or not believed to be facts, by the writers of the other
   books of the bible, and that Moses is not the author of the chapters where
   these accounts are given.

   The next question on the case is how did the Jews come by these notions,
   and at what time were they written? 
   
   To answer this question we must first
   consider what the state of the world was at the time the Jews began to be
   a people, for the Jews are but a modern race, compared with the antiquity
   of other nations. At the time there were, even by their own account, but thirteen Jews or
   Israelites in the world, *Jacob and his twelve sons*, and four of these were
   bastards. The nations of Egypt, Chaldea, Persia and India, were great and
   populous, abounding in learning and science, particularly in the knowledge
   of astronomy of which the Jews were always ignorant. The chronological tables 
   mention, that Eclypsis were observed at Babylon
   above two thousand years before the Christian era, which was before there
   was a single Jew or Israelite in the world.

   All those ancient nations had their cosmogonies, that is, their accounts
   how the creation was made, long before there was such people as Jews or
   Israelites. An account of these cosmogonies of India and Persia is given
   by Henry Lord, Chaplain to the East India Company, at Surat, and published
   in London in 1630. The writer of this has seen a copy of the edition of
   1630, and made extracts from it. The work, which is now scarce, was
   dedicated by Lord to the Arch Bishop of Canterbury.

   We know that the Jews were carried captive into Babylon by Nebuchadnezar,
   and remained in captivity several years, when they were liberated by
   Cyrus, king of Persia. During their captivity they would have had an
   opportunity of acquiring some knowledge of the cosmogony of the Persians,
   or at least of getting some ideas how to fabricate one to put at the head
   of their own history after their return from captivity. This will account
   for the cause, for some cause there must have been, that no mention nor
   reference is made to the cosmogony in Genesis in any of the books of the
   bible supposed to have been written before the captivity, nor is the name
   of Adam to be found in any of those books.

   The Books of Chronicles were written after the return of the Jews from
   captivity, for the third chapter of the first book gives a list of all the
   Jewish kings from David to Zedekiah, who was carried captive into Babylon,
   and to four generations beyond the time of Zedekiah. In the first verse of 
   the first chapter of this book the
   name of Adam is mentioned, but not in any book in the bible, written before
   that time, nor could it be, for Adam and Eve are names taken from the
   cosmogony of the Persians. Henry Lord, in his book, written from Surat, and dedicated, as I have
   already said, to the Arch Bishop of Canterbury, says that in the Persian
   cosmogony the name of the first man was *Adamob* and of the woman *Hevah*.
   (In an English edition of the Bible, in 1583, the first woman is called Hevah.)
   From hence comes the Adam and Eve of the book of Genesis.
   In the cosmogony of India, of which I shall speak in a future number, the
   name of the first man was *Pourous*, and of the woman *Parcoutee*. We want a
   knowledge of the Sanscrit language of India to understand the meaning of
   the names, and I mentioned it in this place, only to show that it is from
   the cosmogony of Persia rather than that of India that the cosmogony in
   Genesis has been fabricated by the Jews, who returned from captivity by
   the liberality of Cyrus, King of Persia. There is, however, reason to conclude, on the authority of Sir William
   Jones, who resided several years in India, that these names were very
   expressive in the language to which they belonged, for in speaking of this
   language, he says (see the Asiatic researches) "The Sanscrit language,
   whatever be its antiquity, is of wonderful structure; it is more perfect
   than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely re-
   fined than either."

   These hints, which are intended to be continued, will serve to shew that a
   society for inquiring into the ancient state of the world, and the state
   of ancient history, so far as history is connected with systems of
   religion, ancient and modern, may become a useful and instructive
   institution. There is good reason to believe we have been in great error with respect
   to the antiquity of the Bible, as well as imposed upon by its contents.
   Truth ought to be the object of every man; for without truth there can be
   no real happiness to a thoughtful mind, or any assurance of happiness
   hereafter. It is the duty of man to obtain all the knowledge he can and
   then make the best use of it.

   T. P.


   From the August 4, 1804 *Prospect* issue:

   To MR. MOORE, *of New-York, Commonly called* BISHOP MOORE.

   I have read in the newspapers your account of the visit you made to the
   unfortunate General Hamilton, and of administering to him a ceremony of
   your church which you call the *Holy Communion*.

   I regret the fate of General Hamilton, and I so far hope with you that it
   will be a warning to thoughtless man not to sport away the life that God
   has given him; but with respect to other parts of your letter I think it
   very reprehensible and betrays great ignorance of what true religion is.
   But you are a priest, you get your living by it, and it is not your
   worldly interest to undeceive yourself.

   After giving an account of your administering to the deceased what you
   call the *Holy Communion*, you add, "By reflecting on this melancholy event
   let the humble believer be encouraged ever to hold fast that precious
   faith which is the *only source of true consolation* in the last extremity
   of nature. Let the infidel be persuaded to abandon his opposition to the
   Gospel."

   To shew you, sir, that your promise of consolation from scripture has no
   foundation to stand upon, I will cite to you one of the greatest
   falshoods upon record, and which was given, as the record says, for the
   purpose, and as a promise, of consolation.

   In the epistle called "the First Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians," (chap. 4)
   The writer consoles the Thessalonians as to the case of their friends who
   were already dead. He does this by informing them, and he does it he says, by the word of the
   Lord, (a most notorious falshood) that the general resurrection of the
   dead, and the ascension of the living, will be in his and their days; that
   their friends will then come to life again; that the dead in Christ will
   rise first. &mdash; "Then WE (says he, v. 17) which *are alive and remain*
   shall be *caught up* together with THEM *in the clouds, to meet the Lord in
   the air*, and so shall we ever be with the Lord &mdash; Wherefore *comfort* one
   another with these words."

   Delusion and falshood cannot be carried higher than they are in this
   passage. You, sir, are but a novice in the art. The words admit of no
   equivocation. The whole passage is in the *first person* and the *present
   tense*, "*We* which *are alive!*" Had the writer meant a future time, and 
   a distant generation, it must have
   been in the third person and the future tense. "*They* who *shall then* be
   alive." I am thus particular for the purpose of nailing you down to the
   text, that you may not ramble from it, nor put other constructions upon
   the words than they will bear, which priests are very apt to do.

   Now, Sir, it is impossible for serious man, to whom God has given the
   divine gift of reason, and who employs that reason to reverence and adore
   the God that gave it, it is, I say, impossible for such a man to put
   confidence in a book that abounds with fable and falsehood as the New
   Testament does. This passage is but a sample of what I could give you.

   You call on those whom you stile "*infidels,*" (and they in return might
   call you an idolator, a worshiper of false Gods, a preacher of false
   doctrine) "to abandon their opposition to the Gospel." Prove, sir, the
   Gospel to be true and the opposition will cease of itself; but until you
   do this, (which we know you cannot do) you have no right to expect they
   will notice your call. If by *infidels* you mean *Deists* (and you must be
   exceedingly ignorant of the origin of the word *Deist*, and know but little
   of *Deus*, to put that construction upon it), you will find yourself
   over-matched if you begin to engage in a controversy with them. Priests 
   may dispute with priests, and sectaries with sectaries, about the
   meaning of what they *agree* to call scripture and end as they began; but
   when you engage with a Deist you must keep to fact. Now, Sir, you cannot
   prove a single article of your religion to be true, and we tell you so
   publicly. Do it, *if you can*. The Deistical article, *the belief of a God*,
   with which your creed begins, has been borrowed by your church from the
   ancient Deists, and even this article you dishonour by putting a *dream-
   begotten* Phantom which you call his son, over His head, and
   treating God as if he was superannuated. (The first chapter of Matthew, relates that Joseph, the
   betrothed husband of Mary, dreamed that the angel told him that his
   intended bride was with child by the Holy Ghost. It is not every husband,
   whether carpenter or priest, that can be so easily satisfied, for lo! it
   was a dream. Whether Mary was in a dream when this was done we are not
   told. It is, however, a comical story. There is no woman living can
   understand it.) Deism is the only profession of religion that admits of worshiping and
   reverencing God in purity, and the only one on which the thoughtful mind
   can repose with undisturbed tranquility. God is almost forgotten in the
   Christian religion. Every thing, even the creation, is ascribed to the son
   of Mary.

   In religion, as in everything else, perfection consists in simplicity. The
   Christian religion of Gods within Gods, like wheels within wheels, is like
   a complicated machine that never goes right, and every projector in the
   art of Christianity is trying to mend it. It is its defects that have
   caused such a number and variety of tinkers to be hammering at it, and
   still it goes wrong. In the visible world no time-keeper can go equally true with the sun; and
   in like manner, no complicated religion can be equally true with the pure
   and unmixed religion of Deism.

   Had you not offensively glanced at a description of men whom you call by a
   false name, you would not have been troubled nor honoured with this
   address; neither has the writer of it any desire or intention to enter
   into controversy with you. He thinks the temporal establishment of your
   church politically unjust and offensively unfair; but with respect to
   religion itself, distinct from temporal establishments, he is happy in the
   enjoyment of his own, and he leaves you to make the best you can of yours.

   A MEMBER OF THE DEISTICAL CHURCH.


   From the August 18, 1804 *Prospect* issue:

   To the Rev. JOHN MASON, *One of the Ministers of the Scotch Presbyterian church, of New-York;* 
   With Remarks on his account of the visit he made to the late General Hamilton.

   "*Come now, let us* REASON *together, saith the Lord.*" This is one of the
   passages you quoted from your bible, in your conversation with General
   Hamilton, as given in your letter, signed with your name, and published in
   the Commercial Advertiser, and other New York papers, and I re-quote the
   passage to shew that your *Text* and your *Religion* contradict each other.

   It is impossible to *reason* upon things *not comprehensible by reason*; and
   therefore, if you keep to your text, which priests seldom do, (for they are
   generally either above it, or below it, or forget it) you must admit a
   religion to which reason can apply, and this certainly is not the
   Christian religion.

   There is not an article in the Christian religion that is cognizable by
   religion. The Deistical article of your religion, *the belief of a God*, is
   no more a Christian article than it is a Mahometan article. It is an
   universal article, common to all religions, and which is held in greater
   purity by Turks than by Christians; but the Deistical church is the only
   one which holds it in real purity; because that church acknowledges no co-
   partnership with God. It believes in him solely; and knows nothing of
   Sons, married Virgins, nor Ghosts. It holds all these things to be the
   fables of priest-craft.

   Why then do you talk of reason, or refer to it, since your religion has
   nothing to do with reason, nor reason with that. You tell people, as you
   told Hamilton, that they must have *faith.* Faith in what? You ought to know
   that before the mind can have faith in any thing, it must either know it as
   a fact, or see cause to believe it on the probability of that kind of
   evidence that is cognizable by reason: But your religion is not within either 
   of these cases; for, in the first
   place, you cannot prove it to be fact; and in the second place, you cannot
   support it by reason, not only because it is not cognizable by reason, but
   because it is contrary to reason. What reason can there be in supposing, or 
   believing, that God put *himself
   to death, to satisfy himself, and be revenged on the Devil on account of
   Adam;* for tell the story which way you will it comes to this at last.

   As you can make no appeal to reason in support of an unreasonable
   religion, you then (and others of your profession) bring yourselves off by
   telling people, they must not believe in *reason* but in *revelation*.
   This is the artifice of habit without reflection. It is putting *words* in
   the place of *things*; for do you not see, that when you tell people to
   believe in revelation, you must first prove that what you *call* revelation,
   *is* revelation; and as you cannot do this, you put the *word* which is
   easily spoken, in the place of the *thing* you cannot prove. You have no 
   more evidence that your Gospel is revelation than the Turks
   have that their Koran is revelation, and the only difference between them
   and you is, that they preach *their* delusion and you preach *yours*.

   In your conversation with General Hamilton, you say to him, "The *simple
   truths* of the Gospel which require *no abstruse investigation*, but faith in
   the veracity of *God, who cannot lie*, are best suited to your present
   condition."

   If those matters you call "*simple truths,*" are what you call them, and
   *require no abstruse investigation*, they would be so obvious that reason
   would easily comprehend them; yet the doctrine you preach at other times
   is, *That the mysteries of the Gospel are beyond the reach of reason.*
   If your first position be true, that they are"* simple truths*," priests are
   unnecessary, for we do not want preachers to tell us the sun shines: and
   if your second be true, the case, as to effect, is the same, for it is
   waste of money to pay a man to explain unexplainable things, and loss of
   time to listen to him. That "*God cannot lie,*" is no advantage to your argument, because it is no
   proof that priests cannot, or that the Bible does not. Did not Paul lie
   when he told the Thessalonians that the general resurrection of the dead
   would be in his life-time, and that he should go up alive along with them
   into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air? I Thess. chap. 4, v. 27.

   You spoke of what you call, "*the precious blood of Christ.*" This savage
   stile of language belongs to the priests of the Christian religion. The
   professors of this religion say they are shocked at the accounts of human
   sacrifices of which they read in the histories of some countries. Do they
   not see that their own religion is founded on a human sacrifice, the blood
   of man, of which their priests talk like so many butchers. It is no wonder 
   the Christian religion has been so bloody in its effects,
   for it began in blood, and many thousands of human sacrifices have since
   been offered on the altar of the Christian religion.

   It is necessary to the character of a religion, as being true, and
   immutable as God Himself is, that the evidence of it be equally the same
   through all periods of time and circumstance. This is not the case with the 
   Christian religion, nor with that of the
   Jews that preceded it, (for there was a time, and that within the knowledge
   of history, when these religions did not exist) nor is it the case with
   any religion we know of but the religion of Deism. In this the evidences
   are eternal and universal &mdash;  "*The heavens declare the glory of God and the
   firmament showeth his handiwork, &mdash; Day unto day uttereth speech, and night
   unto night sheweth knowledge.*" (This Psalm (19) which is a *Deistical
   Psalm,* is so much in the manner of some parts of the book of Job (which
   is not a book of the Jews, and does not belong to the bible) that it has
   the appearance of having been translated into Hebrew from the same
   language in which the book of Job was originally written, and brought by
   the Jews from Chaldea or Persia, when they returned from captivity. The
   contemplation of the Heavens made a great part of the religious devotion
   of the Chaldeans and Persians, and their religious festivals were
   regulated by the progress of the sun through the twelve signs of the
   Zodiac. But the Jews knew nothing about the Heavens, or they would not
   have told the foolish story of the sun's standing still upon a hill, and
   the moon in a valley. What could they want the moon for in the day
   time?) But all other religions are made to arise from some local
   circumstance, and are introduced by some temporary trifle which its
   partisans call a miracle, but of which there is no proof but the story of
   it.

   The Jewish religion, according to the history of it, began in a
   *wilderness*, and the Christian religion in a *stable*. The Jewish books tell
   us of wonders exhibited upon Mount Sinai. It happened that nobody lived
   there to contradict the account. The Christian books tell us of a star that hung over the *stable* at the
   birth of Jesus. There is no star there now, nor any person living that saw
   it. But all the stars in the Heavens bear eternal evidence to the truth of
   Deism. It did not begin in a stable, nor in a wilderness. It began
   every where. The theater of the universe is the place of its birth.

   As adoration paid to any being but GOD himself is idolatry, the Christian
   religion by paying adoration to a man, born of a woman, called Mary,
   belongs to the Idolatrous class of religions; consequently the consolation
   drawn from it is delusion. Between you and your rival in communion ceremonies, Dr. Moore, of the
   Episcopal church, you have, in order to make yourselves appear of some
   importance, reduced General Hamilton's character to that of a
   feeble-minded man, who in going out of the world wanted a passport from a
   priest. Which of you was first or last applied to for this purpose is a
   matter of no consequence.

   The man, sir, who puts his trust and confidence in God, that leads a just
   and moral life, and endeavours to do good, does not trouble himself about
   priests when his hour of departure comes, nor permits priests to trouble
   themselves about him. They are, in general, mischievous Beings where
   character is concerned; a consultation of priests is worse than
   consultation of physicians.

   ON DEISM, AND THE WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE

   The following reflections, written last winter, were occasioned by certain
   expressions in some of the public papers against Deism and the writings of
   Thomas Paine on that subject.

   "Great is Diana of the Ephesians" was the cry of the people of Ephesus
   (Acts xix, 28); and the cry of "our holy religion" has been the cry of
   superstition in some instances, and of hypocrisy in others, from that day
   to this.

   The Brahmin, the follower of Zoroaster, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Church
   of Rome, the Greek Church, the Protestant Church, split into several
   hundred contradictory sectaries, preaching in some instances damnation
   against each other, all cry out, "our holy religion."

   The Calvinist, who damns children of a span long to hell to burn forever
   for the glory of God (and this is called Christianity), and the
   Universalist who preaches that all shall be saved and none shall be damned
   (and this also is called Christianity), boast alike of their holy religion
   and their Christian faith.

   Something more therefore is necessary than mere cry and wholesale
   assertion, and that something is TRUTH; and as inquiry is the road to
   truth, he that is opposed to inquiry is not a friend to truth.

   The God of truth is not the God of fable; when, therefore, any book is
   introduced into the world as the Word of God, and made a groundwork for
   religion, it ought to be scrutinized more than other books to see if it
   bear evidence of being what it is called. Our reverence to God demands
   that we do this, lest we ascribe to God what is not His, and our duty to
   ourselves demands it lest we take fable for fact, and rest our hope of
   salvation on a false foundation.

   It is not our calling a book holy that makes it so, any more than our
   calling a religion holy that entitles it to the name. Inquiry therefore is
   necessary in order to arrive at truth. But inquiry must have some
   principle to proceed on, some standard to judge by, superior to human
   authority.

   When we survey the works of creation, the revolutions of the planetary
   system, and the whole economy of what is called nature, which is no other
   than the laws the Creator has prescribed to matter, we see unerring order
   and universal harmony reigning throughout the whole. No one part
   contradicts another. The sun does not run against the moon, nor the moon
   against the sun, nor the planets against each other. Everything keeps its
   appointed time and place.

   This harmony in the works of God is so obvious, that the farmer of  the
   field, though he cannot calculate eclipses, is as sensible of it as the
   philosophical astronomer. He sees the God of order in every part of the
   visible universe.

   Here, then, is the standard to which everything must be brought that
   pretends to be the work or Word of God, and by this standard it must be
   judged, independently of anything and everything that man can say or do.
   His opinion is like a feather in the scale compared with the standard that
   God Himself has set up.

   It is, therefore, by this standard that the Bible and all other books
   pretending to be the Word of God (and there are many of them in the world)
   must be judged, and not by the opinions of men or the decrees of
   ecclesiastical councils. These have been so contradictory that they have
   often rejected in one council what they had voted to be the Word of God in
   another; and admitted what had been before rejected.

   In this state of uncertainty in which we are, and which is rendered still
   more uncertain by the numerous contradictory sectaries that have sprung up
   since the time of Luther and Calvin, what is man to do? The answer is
   easy. Begin at the root-begin with the Bible itself. Examine it with the
   utmost strictness. It is our duty so to do.

   Compare the parts with each other, and the whole with the harmonious,
   magnificent order that reigns throughout the visible universe, and the
   result will be, that if the same Almighty wisdom that created the universe
   dictated also the Bible, the Bible will be as harmonious and as
   magnificent in all its parts, and in the whole, as the universe is.

   But if, instead of this, the parts are found to be discordant,
   contradicting in one place what is said in another (as in II Sam. xxiv, 1,
   and I Chron. xxi, 1, where the same action is ascribed to God in one book
   and to Satan in the other), abounding also in idle and obscene stories,
   and representing the Almighty as a passionate, whimsical Being,
   continually changing His mind, making and unmaking His own works as if He
   did not know what He was about, we may take it for certainty that the
   Creator of the universe is not the author of such a book, that it is not
   the Word of God, and that to call it so is to dishonor His name.

   The Quakers, who are a people more moral and regular in their conduct than
   the people of other sectaries, and generally allowed so to be, do not hold
   the Bible to be the Word of God. They call it a history of the times, and
   a bad history it is, and also a history of bad men and of bad actions, and
   abounding with bad examples.

   For several centuries past the dispute has been about doctrines. It is now
   about fact. Is the Bible the Word of God, or is it not? For until this
   point is established, no doctrine drawn from the Bible can afford real
   consolation to man, and he ought to be careful he does not mistake
   delusion for truth. This is a case that concerns all men alike.

   There has always existed in Europe, and also in America, since its
   establishment, a numerous description of men (I do not here mean the
   Quakers) who did not, and do not believe the Bible to be the Word of God.
   These men never formed themselves into an established society, but are to
   be found in all the sectaries that exist, and are more numerous than any,
   perhaps equal to all, and are daily increasing. From Deus, the Latin word
   for God, they have been denominated Deists, that is, believers in God. It
   is the most honorable appellation that can be given to man, because it is
   derived immediately from the Deity. It is not an artificial name like
   Episcopalian, Presbyterian, etc., but is a name of sacred signification,
   and to revile it is to revile the name of God.

   Since then there is so much doubt and uncertainty about the Bible, some
   asserting and others denying it to be the Word of God, it is best that the
   whole matter come out. It is necessary for the information of the world
   that it should.

   A better time cannot offer than while the Government, patronizing no one
   sect or opinion in preference to another, protects equally the rights of
   all; and certainly every man must spurn the idea of an ecclesiastical
   tyranny, engrossing the rights of the press, and holding it free only for
   itself.

   While the terrors of the Church, and the tyranny of the State, hung like a
   pointed sword over Europe, men were commanded to believe what the Church
   told them, or go to the stake. All inquiries into the authenticity of the
   Bible were shut out by the Inquisition. We ought therefore to suspect that
   a great mass of information respecting the Bible, and the introduction of
   it into the world, has been suppressed by the united tyranny of Church and
   State, for the purpose of keeping people in ignorance, and which ought to
   be known.

   The Bible has been received by the Protestants on the authority of the
   Church of Rome, and on no other authority. It is she that has said it is
   the Word of God. We do not admit the authority of that Church with respect
   to its pretended infallibility, its manufactured miracles, its setting
   itself up to forgive sins, its amphibious doctrine of transubstantiation,
   etc.; and we ought to be watchful with respect to any book introduced by
   her, or her ecclesiastical councils, and called by her the Word of God:
   and the more so, because it was by propagating that belief and supporting
   it by fire and faggot that she kept up her temporal power.

   That the belief of the Bible does no good in the world, may be seen by the
   irregular lives of those, as well priests as laymen, who profess to
   believe it to be the Word of God, and the moral lives of the Quakers who
   do not. It abounds with too many ill examples to be made a rule for moral
   life, and were a man to copy after the lives of some of its most
   celebrated characters he would come to the gallows.

   Thomas Paine has written to show that the Bible is not the Word of God,
   that the books it contains were not written by the persons to whom they
   are ascribed, that it is an anonymous book, and that we have no authority
   for calling it the Word of God, or for saying it was written by inspired
   penmen, since we do not know who the writers were.

   This is the opinion not only of Thomas Paine, but of thousands and tens of
   thousands of the most respectable characters in the United States and in
   Europe. These men have the same right to their opinions as others have to
   contrary opinions, and the same right to publish them. Ecclesiastical
   tyranny is not admissible in the United States.

   With respect to morality, the writings of Thomas Paine are remarkable for
   purity and benevolence; and though he often enlivens them with touches of
   wit and humor, he never loses sight of the real solemnity of his subject.
   No man's morals, either with respect to his Maker, himself, or his
   neighbor, can suffer by the writings of Thomas Paine.

   It is now too late to abuse Deism, especially in a country where the press
   is free, or where free presses can be established. It is a religion that
   has God for its patron and derives its name from Him. The thoughtful mind
   of man, wearied with the endless contents of sectaries against sectaries,
   doctrines against doctrines, and priests against priests, finds its repose
   at last in the contemplative belief and worship of one God and the
   practice of morality; for as Pope wisely says-"He can't be wrong whose
   life is in the right."



   OF THE BOOKS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT

   ADDRESS TO THE BELIEVERS IN THE BOOK CALLED THE SCRIPTURES

   The New Testament contains twenty-seven books, of which four are called
   Gospels; one called the Acts of the Apostles; fourteen called the Epistles
   of Paul; one of James; two of Peter; three of John; one of Jude; one
   called the Revelation.

   None of those books have the appearance of being written by the persons
   whose names they bear, neither do we know who the authors were. They come
   to us on no other authority than the Church of Rome, which the Protestant
   priests, especially those of New England, call the Whore of Babylon.

   This Church, or to use their own vulgar language, this whore, appointed
   sundry councils to be held, to compose creeds for the people, and to
   regulate Church affairs. Two of the principal of these councils were that
   of Nice, and of Laodicea (names of the places where the councils

   were held) about three hundred and fifty years after the time that Jesus
   is said to have lived. Before this time there was no such book as the New
   Testament.

   But the Church could not well go on without having something to show, as
   the Persians showed the Zend-Avesta, revealed they say by God to
   Zoroaster; the Bramins of India, the Shaster, revealed, they say, by God
   to Brama, and given to him out of a dusky cloud; the Jews, the books they
   call the Law of Moses, given they say also out of a cloud on Mount Sinai.

   The Church set about forming a code for itself out of such materials as it
   could find or pick up. But where they got those materials, in what
   language they were written, or whose handwriting they were, or whether
   they were originals or copies, or on what authority they stood, we know
   nothing of, nor does the New Testament tell us.

   The Church was resolved to have a New Testament, and as, after the lapse
   of more than three hundred years, no handwriting could be proved or
   disproved, the Church, which like former impostors had then gotten
   possession of the State, had everything its own way. It invented creeds,
   such as that called the Apostles' Creed, the Nicean Creed, the Athanasian
   Creed, and out of the loads of rubbish that were presented it voted four
   to be Gospels, and others to be Epistles, as we now find them arranged.

   Of those called Gospels, above forty were presented, each pretending to be
   genuine. Four only were voted in, and entitled: the Gospel according to
   St. Matthew-the Gospel according to St. Mark-the Gospel according to St.
   Luke-the Gospel according to St. John.

   This word according, shows that those books have not been written by
   Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but according to some accounts or
   traditions, picked up concerning them. The word "according" means agreeing
   with, and necessarily includes the idea of two things, or two persons.

   We cannot say, The Gospel written by Matthew according to Matthew; but we
   might say, the Gospel of some other person according to what was reported
   to have been the opinion of Matthew. Now we do not know who those other
   persons were, nor whether what they wrote accorded with anything that
   Matthew, Mark, Luke and John might have said. There is too little
   evidence, and too much contrivance, about those books to merit credit.

   The next book after those called Gospels, is that called the Acts of the
   Apostles. This book is anonymous; neither do the councils that compiled or
   contrived the New Testament tell us how they came by it. The Church, to
   supply this defect, say it was written by Luke, which shows that the
   Church and its priests have not compared that called the Gospel according
   to St. Luke and the Acts together, for the two contradict each other.

   The book of Luke, xxiv, makes Jesus ascend into heaven the very same day
   that it makes him rise from the grave. The book of Acts, i, 3, says that
   he remained on earth forty days after his crucifixion. There is no
   believing what either of them says.

   The next to the book of Acts is that entitled, "The Epistle of Paul the
   Apostle (According to the criterion of the Church, Paul was not an
   apostle; that appellation being given only to those called the Twelve. Two
   sailors belonging to a man-of-war got into a dispute upon this point,
   whether Paul was an apostle or not, and they agreed to refer it to the
   boatswain, who decided very canonically that Paul was an acting apostle
   but not rated.-Author.) to the Romans." This is not an epistle, or letter,
   written by Paul or signed by him. It is an epistle, or letter, written by
   a person who signs himself TERTIUS, and sent, as it is said in the end, by
   a servant woman called Phebe. The last chapter, ver. 22, says, "I Tertius,
   who wrote this epistle, salute you." Who Tertius or Phebe was, we know
   nothing of.

   The epistle is not dated. The whole of it is written in the first person,
   and that person is Tertius, not Paul. But it suited the Church to ascribe
   it to Paul. There is nothing in it that is interesting except it be to
   contending and wrangling sectaries. The stupid metaphor of the potter and
   the clay is in chapter ix.

   The next book is entitled "The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
   Corinthians." This, like the former, is not an epistle written by Paul,
   nor signed by him. The conclusion of the epistle says, "The first
   epistleto the Corinthians was written from Philippi, by Stephanas, and
   Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and Timotheus."

   The second epistle entitled "The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
   Corinthians," is in the same case with the first. The conclusion of it
   says, "It was written from Philippi, a city of Macedonia, by Titus and
   Lucas."

   A question may arise upon these cases, which is, are these persons the
   writers of the epistles originally, or are they the writers and attestors
   of copies sent to the councils who compiled the code or canon of the New
   Testament? If the epistles had been dated this question could be decided;
   but in either of the cases the evidences of Paul's handwriting and of
   their being written by him is wanting, and, therefore, there is no
   authority for calling them Epistles of Paul. We know not whose epistles
   they were, nor whether they are genuine or forged.

   The next is entitled, "The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians."
   It contains six short chapters, yet the writer of it says, vi, n , "Ye see
   how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand." If Paul was
   the writer of this it shows he did not accustom himself to write long
   epistles; yet the epistle to the Romans and the first to the Corinthians
   contain sixteen chapters each; the second to the Corinthians and that to
   the Hebrews thirteen each.

   There is something contradictory in these matters. But short as the
   epistle is, it does not carry the appearance of being the work or com-
   position of one person. Chapter v, 2, says, "If ye be circumcised Christ
   shall avail you nothing." It does not say circumcision shall profit you
   nothing, but Christ shall profit you nothing. Yet in vi, 15, it says "For
   in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision,
   but a new creature."

   These are not reconcilable passages, nor can contrivance make them so. The
   conclusion of the epistle says it was written from Rome, but it is not
   dated, nor is there any signature to it, neither do the compilers of the
   New Testament say how they came by it. We are in the dark upon all these
   matters.

   The next is entitled, "The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians."
   Paul is not the writer. The conclusion of it says, "Written from Rome unto
   the Ephesians by Tychicus."

   The next is entitled, "The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
   Philippians." Paul is not the writer. The conclusion of it says, "It was
   written to the Philippians from Rome by Epaphroditus." It is not dated.
   Query, were those men who wrote and signed those epistles journeymen
   Aposties, who undertook to write in Paul's name, as Paul is said to have
   preached in Christ's name?

   The next is entitled, "The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians."
   Paul is not the writer. Doctor Luke is spoken of in this epistle as
   sending his compliments. "Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet
   you" (iv, 14). It does not say a word about his writing any Gospel. The
   conclusion of the epistle says, "Written from Rome to the Colossians by
   Tychicus and Onesimus."

   The next is entitled, "The First and the Second Epistles of Paul the
   Apostle to the Thessalonians." Either the writer of these epistles was a
   visionary enthusiast, or a direct impostor, for he tells the
   Thessalonians, and, he says, he tells them by the Word of the Lord, that
   the world will be at an end in his and their time; and after telling them
   that those who are already dead shall rise, he adds, iv, 17, "Then we
   which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them into the clouds to
   meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we be ever with the Lord."

   Such detected lies as these, ought to fill priests with confusion, when
   they preach such books to be the Word of God. These two epistles are said
   in the conclusion of them to be written from Athens. They are without date
   or signature.

   The next four epistles are private letters. Two of them are private
   letters. Two of them are to Timothy, one to Titus and one to Philemon. Who
   they were, nobody knows.

   The first to Timothy, is said to be written from Laodicea. It is without
   date or signature. The second to Timothy, is said to be written from Rome,
   and is without date or signature. The epistle to Titus is said to be
   written from Nicopolis in Macedonia. It is without date or signature. The
   epistle to Philemon is said to be written from Rome by Onesimus. It is
   without date.

   The last epistle ascribed to Paul is entitled "The Epistle of Paul the
   Apostle to the Hebrews," and is said in the conclusion to be written from
   Italy, by Timothy. This Timothy (according to the conclusion of the
   epistle called the Second Epistle of Paul to Timothy) was Bishop of the
   Church of the Ephesians, and consequently this is not an epistle of Paul.

   On what slender cobweb evidence do the priests and professors of the
   Christian religion hang their faith? The same degree of hearsay evidence,
   and that at third and fourth hand, would not, in a court of justice, give
   a man title to a cottage, and yet the priests of this profession
   presumptuously promise their deluded followers the Kingdom of Heaven. A
   little reflection would teach men that those books are not to be trusted
   to; that so far from there being any proof they are the Word of God, it is
   unknown who the writers of them were, or at what time they were written,
   within three hundred years after the reputed authors are said to have
   lived.

   It is not the interest of priests, who get their living by them, to
   examine into the insufficiency of the evidence upon which those books were
   received by the popish councils who compiled the New Testament. But if
   Messrs. Linn and Mason would occupy themselves upon this subject (it
   signifies not which side they take, for the event will be the same) they
   would be better employed than they were last Presidential election, in
   writing Jesuitical electioneering pamphlets. The very name of a priest
   attaches suspicion on to it the instant he becomes a dabbler in party
   politics.

   The New England priests set themselves up to govern the state, and they
   are falling into contempt for so doing. Men who have their farms and their
   several occupations to follow, and have a common interest with their
   neighbors in the public prosperity and tranquility of their country,
   neither want nor choose to be told by a priest who they shall vote for,
   nor how they shall conduct their temporal concerns.

   The cry of the priests that the Church is in danger, is the cry of men who
   do not understand the interest of their own craft; for instead of exciting
   alarms and apprehensions for its safety, as they expect, it excites
   suspicion that the foundation is not sound, and that it is necessary to
   take down and build it on a surer foundation. Nobody fears for the safety
   of a mountain, but a hillock of sand may be washed away! Blow then, O ye
   priests, "The Trumpet in Zion," for the Hillock is in danger.



   BIBLICAL BLASPHEMY

   The Church tells us that the books of the Old and New Testament are divine
   revelation, and without this revelation we could not have true ideas of
   God.

   The Deist, on the contrary, says that those books are not divine
   revelation; and that were it not for the light of reason and the religion
   of Deism, those books, instead of teaching us true ideas of God, would
   teach us not only false but blasphemous ideas of Him.

   Deism teaches us that God is a God of truth and justice. Does the Bible
   teach the same doctrine o ? It does not.

   The Bible says (Jeremiah xx, 5, 7) that God is a deceiver. "O Lord (says
   Jeremiah) thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived. Thou art stronger
   than I, and hast prevailed."

   Jeremiah not only upbraids God with deceiving him, but, in iv, 9, he
   upbraids God with deceiving the people of Jerusalem. "Ah! Lord God (says
   he), surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying,
   ye shall have peace, whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul."

   In xv, 8, the Bible becomes more impudent, and calls God in plain
   language, a liar. "Wilt thou (says Jeremiah to God) be altogether unto me
   as a liar and as waters that fail?"

   Ezekiel xiv, 9, makes God to say-"If the prophet be deceived when he hath
   spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet." All this is
   downright blasphemy.

   The prophet Micaiah, as he is called, II Chron. xviii, 18-21, tells
   another blasphemous story of God. "I saw," says he, "the Lord sitting on
   His throne, and all the hosts of Heaven standing on His right hand and on
   His left. And the Lord said, who shall entice Ahab, King of Israel, to go
   up and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And one spoke after this manner, and another
   after that manner.

   "Then there came out a spirit [Micaiah does not tell us where he came
   from] and stood before the Lord [what an impudent fellow this spirit was]
   and said, I will entice him. And the Lord said unto him, where- with? And
   he said, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
   prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also
   prevail; go out, and do even so."

   We often hear of a gang of thieves plotting to rob and murder a man, and
   laying a plan to entice him out that they may execute their design, and we
   always feel shocked at the wickedness of such wretches; but what must we
   think of a book that describes the Almighty acting in the same manner, and
   laying plans in heaven to entrap and ruin mankind? Our ideas of His
   justice and goodness forbid us to believe such stories, and therefore we
   say that a lying spirit has been in the mouth of the writers of the books
   of the Bible.

   BIBLICAL ANACHRONISM

   In addition to the judicious remarks in your twelfth number, on the absurd
   story of Noah's Flood, in Genesis vii, I send you the following :

   The second verse makes God to say unto Noah, "Of every clean beast thou
   shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female, and of every beast
   that are not clean, by two, the male and his female."

   Now, there was no such thing as beasts clean and unclean in the time of
   Noah. Neither were there any such people as Jews or Israelites at that
   time, to whom that distinction was a law. The law, called the Law of
   Moses, by which a distinction is made, beasts clean and unclean, was not
   until several hundred years after the time that Noah is said to have
   lived.

   The story, therefore, detects itself, because the inventor forgot himself,
   by making God make use of an expression that could not be used at the
   time. The blunder is of the same kind as if a man, in telling a story
   about America a hundred years ago, should quote an expression from Mr.
   Jefferson's inaugural speech as if spoken by him at that time.

   My opinion of this story is the same as what a man once said to another,
   who asked him in a drawling tone of voice, "Do you believe the account
   about No-ah?" The other replied in the same tone of voice, ah-no.

   RELIGIOUS INTELLIGENCE

   The following publication, which has appeared in several newspapers in
   different parts of the United States, shows in the most striking manner
   the character and effects of religious fanaticism, and to what extravagant
   lengths it will carry its unruly and destructive operations.

   We give it a place in The Prospect, because we think the perusal of it
   will be gratifying to our subscribers; and, because, by exposing the true
   character of such frantic zeal, we hope to produce some influence upon the
   reason of man, and induce him to rise superior to such dreadful illusions.
   The judicious remarks at the end of this account were communicated to us
   by a very intelligent and faithful friend to the cause of Deism.

   Extract from a Letter of the Rev. George Scott, of Mill Creek, Washington
   County, Pennsylvania, to Colonel William MFarran, of Mount Bethel,
   Northampton County, Pa., dated November 3, 1802.

   "MY DEAR FRIEND,

   "We have wonderful times here. God has been pleased to visit this barren
   corner with abundance of His grace. The work began in a neighboring
   congregation, at a sacramental occasion, about the last of September. It
   did not make its appearance in my congregation till the  first Tuesday of
   October. After society in the night there appeared an evident stir among
   the young people, but nothing of the appearance of what appeared
   afterwards. "On Saturday evening following we had society, but it was dull
   throughout. On Sabbath-day one cried out, but nothing else extraordinary
   appeared. That evening I went part of the way to the Raccoon congregation,
   where the sacrament of the supper was administered; but on Monday morning
   a very strong impression of duty constrained me to return to my
   congregation in the Flats, where the work was begun.

   "We met in the afternoon at the meeting-house, where we had a warm
   society. In the evening we removed to a neighboring house, where we
   continued in society till midnight; numbers were falling all the time of
   society. After the people were dismissed, a considerable number stayed and
   sung hymns till perhaps two o'clock in the morning, when the work began,
   to the astonishment of all. Only five or six were left able to take care
   of the rest, to the number perhaps of near forty. They fell in all
   directions, on benches, on beds and on the floor.

   "Next morning the people began to flock in from all quarters. One girl
   came early in the morning, but did not get within one hundred yards of the
   house before she fell powerless, and was carried in. We could not leave
   the house, and, therefore, continued society all that day and all that
   night, and on Wednesday morning I was obliged to leave a number of them on
   the spot.

   "On Thursday evening we met again, when the work was amazing; about twenty
   persons lay to all appearances dead for near two and a half hours, and a
   great number cried out with sore distress.

   "Friday I preached at Mill Creek. Here nothing appeared more than an
   unusual solemnity. That evening we had society, where great numbers were
   brought under conviction, but none fell. On Sabbath-day, I preached at
   Mill Creek. This day and evening was a very solemn time but none fell.

   "On Monday I went to attend presbytery, but returned on Thursday evening
   to the Flats, where society was appointed, when numbers were struck down.
   On Saturday evening we had society, and a very solemn time-about a dozen
   persons lay dead three and a half hours by the watch. On Sabbath a number
   fell, and we were obliged to continue all night in society, as we had done
   every evening we had met before.

   "On Monday a Mr. Hughes preached at Mill Creek, but nothing extraordinary
   appeared, only a great deal of falling. We concluded to divide that
   evening into two societies, in order to accommodate the people. Mr. H.
   attended the one and I the other. Nothing strange appeared when Mr. H.
   attended; but where I attended God was present in the most wonderful
   manner. I believe there was not one present but was more or less affected.
   A considerable number fell powerless, and two or three, after laying some
   time, recovered with joy, and spoke near half an hour.

   "One, especially, declared in a surprising manner the wonderful view she
   had of the person, character and offices of Christ, with such accuracy of
   language that I was astonished to hear it. Surely this must be the work of
   God! On Thursday evening we had a lively society, but not much falling
   down. On Saturday we all went to the Cross Roads and attended a sacrament.
   Here were, perhaps, about four thousand people collected. The weather was
   uncomfortable; on the Sabbath-day it rained, and on Monday it snowed. We
   had thirteen ministers present.

   "The exercises began on Saturday, and continued on night and day with
   little or no intermission. Great numbers fell; to speak within bounds,
   there were upwards of one hundred and fifty down at one time, and some of
   them continued three or four hours with but little appearance of life.
   Numbers came to, rejoicing, while others were deeply distressed. The scene
   was wonderful; the cries of the distressed, and the agonizing groans, gave
   some faint representation of the awful cries and the bitter screams which
   will no doubt be extorted from the damned in hell.

   "But what is to me the most surprising, of those who have been subjects
   among my people with whom I have conversed, but three had any terrors of
   hell during their exercise. The principal cry is, O how long have I
   rejected Christ! O how often have I imbrued my hands in his precious
   blood! O how often have I waded through his precious blood by stifling
   conviction! O this dreadful hard heart! O what a dreadful monster sin is!
   It was my sin that nailed Jesus to the cross! etc.

   "The preaching is various; some thunder the terrors of the law-others
   preach the mild invitation of the Gospel. For my part, since the work
   began, I have confined myself chiefly to the doctrines of our fallen state
   by nature, and the way of recovery through Christ; opening the way of
   salvation; showing how God can be just and yet be the justifier of them
   that believe, and also the nature of true faith and repentance; pointing
   out the difference between true and false religion, and urging the
   invitations of the Gospel in the most engaging manner that I am master
   mof, without any strokes of terror.

   "The convictions and cries appear to be, perhaps, nearly equal under all
   these different modes of preaching, but it appears rather most when we
   preach on the fullness and freeness of salvation."



   REMARKS BY MR. PAINE

   In the fifth chapter of Mark, we read a strange story of the devil getting
   into the swine after he had been turned out of a man, and as the freaks of
   the devil in that story and the tumbledown description in this are very
   much alike, the two stories ought to go together.

   The force of the imagination is capable of producing strange effects. When
   animal magnetism began in France, which was while Dr. Franklin was
   Minister of that country, the wonderful accounts given of the wonderful
   effects it produced on the persons who were under operation, exceeded
   anything related in the foregoing letter from Washington County. They
   tumbled down, fell into trances, roared and rolled about like persons
   supposed to be bewitched.

   The Government, in order to ascertain the fact, or detect the imposition,
   appointed a committee of physicians to inquire into the case, and Dr.
   Franklin was requested to accompany them, which he did. The committee went
   to the operator's house, and the persons on whom an operation was to be
   performed were assembled. They were placed in the position in which they
   had been when under former operations, and blindfolded.

   In a little time they began to show signs of agitation, and in the space
   of about two hours they went through all the frantic airs they had shown
   before; but the case was that no operation was performing upon them,
   neither was the operator in the room, for he had been ordered out of it by
   the physicians; but as the persons did not know this, they supposed him
   present and operating upon them. It was the effect of imagination only.

   Dr. Franklin, in relating this account to the writer of this article, said
   that he thought the Government might as well have let it gone on, for that
   as imagination sometimes produced disorders it might also cure some. It is
   fortunate, however, that this falling down and crying out scene did not
   happen in New England a century ago, for if it had the preachers would
   have been hung for witchcraft, and in more ancient times the poor
   falling-down folks would have been supposed to be possessed of a devil,
   like the man in Mark, among the tombs. The progress that reason and Deism
   make in the world lessen the force of superstition and abate the spirit of
   persecution.
