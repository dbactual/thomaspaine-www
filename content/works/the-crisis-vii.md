   Crisis VII



   Foner's introduction:

   Several of the articles in the Crisis series were addressed to the English
   people; indeed, as Paine points out in the seventh Crisis it had always
   been his "design to dedicate a Crisis" to them. In these articles Paine
   explained the issues at stake in the war, indicated how they were related
   to the struggle of the English progressives against despotism at home,
   showed how impossible it was for England ever to defeat the Americans, and
   called upon the English people to follow the example of the United States
   by starting their own revolution and convening a Congress.

   TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND

   THERE are stages in the business of serious life in which to amuse is
   cruel, but to deceive is to destroy; and it is of little consequence, in
   the conclusion, whether men deceive themselves, or submit, by a kind of
   mutual consent, to the impositions of each other. That England has long
   been under the influence of delusion or mistake, needs no other proof than
   the unexpected and wretched situation that she is now involved in: and so
   powerful has been the influence, that no provision was ever made or
   thought of against the misfortune, because the possibility of its
   happening was never conceived.

   The general and successful resistance of America, the conquest of
   Burgoyne, and a war in France, were treated in parliament as the dreams of
   a discontented opposition, or a distempered imagination. They were beheld
   as objects unworthy of a serious thought, and the bare intimation of them
   afforded the ministry a triumph of laughter. Short triumph indeed! For
   everything which has been predicted has happened, and all that was
   promised has failed. A long series of politics so remarkably distinguished
   by a succession of misfortunes, without one alleviating turn, must
   certainly have something in it systematically wrong. It is sufficient to
   awaken the most credulous into suspicion, and the most obstinate into
   thought. Either the means in your power are insufficient, or the measures
   ill planned; either the execution has been bad, or the thing attempted
   impracticable; or, to speak more emphatically, either you are not able or
   heaven is not willing. For, why is it that you have not conquered us? Who,
   or what has prevented you? You have had every opportunity that you could
   desire, and succeeded to your utmost wish in every preparatory means. Your
   fleets and armies have arrived in America without an accident. No uncommon
   fortune has intervened. No foreign nation has interfered until the time
   which you had allotted for victory was passed. The opposition, either in
   or out of parliament, neither disconcerted your measures, retarded or
   diminished your force. They only foretold your fate. Every ministerial
   scheme was carried with as high a hand as if the whole nation had been
   unanimous. Every thing wanted was asked for, and every thing asked for was
   granted.

   A greater force was not within the compass of your abilities to send, and
   the time you sent it was of all others the most favorable. You were then
   at rest with the whole world beside. You had the range of every court in
   Europe uncontradicted by us. You amused us with a tale of commissioners of
   peace, and under that disguise collected a numerous army and came almost
   unexpectedly upon us. The force was much greater than we looked for; and
   that which we had to oppose it with, was unequal in numbers, badly armed,
   and poorly disciplined; beside which, it was embodied only for a short
   time, and expired within a few months after your arrival. We had
   governments to form; measures to concert; an army to train, and every
   necessary article to import or to create. Our non-importation scheme had
   exhausted our stores, and your command by sea intercepted our supplies. We
   were a people unknown, and unconnected with the political world, and
   strangers to the disposition of foreign powers. Could you possibly wish
   for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances? Yet all these have
   happened and passed away, and, as it were, left you with a laugh. There
   are likewise, events of such an original nativity as can never happen
   again, unless a new world should arise from the ocean.

   If any thing can be a lesson to presumption, surely the circumstances of
   this war will have their effect. Had Britain been defeated by any European
   power, her pride would have drawn consolation from the importance of her
   conquerors; but in the present case, she is excelled by those that she
   affected to despise, and her own opinions retorting upon herself, become
   an aggravation of her disgrace. Misfortune and experience are lost upon
   mankind, when they produce neither reflection nor reformation. Evils, like
   poisons, have their uses, and there are diseases which no other remedy can
   reach. It has been the crime and folly of England to suppose herself
   invincible, and that, without acknowledging or perceiving that a full
   third of her strength was drawn from the country she is now at war with.
   The arm of Britain has been spoken of as the arm of the Almighty, and she
   has lived of late as if she thought the whole world created for her
   diversion. Her politics, instead of civilizing, has tended to brutalize
   mankind, and under the vain, unmeaning title of "Defender of the Faith,"
   she has made war like an Indian against the religion of humanity. Her
   cruelties in the East Indies will never be forgotten, and it is somewhat
   remarkable that the produce of that ruined country, transported to
   America, should there kindle up a war to punish the destroyer. The chain
   is continued, though with a mysterious kind of uniformity both in the
   crime and the punishment. The latter runs parallel with the former, and
   time and fate will give it a perfect illustration.

   When information is withheld, ignorance becomes a reasonable excuse; and
   one would charitably hope that the people of England do not encourage
   cruelty from choice but from mistake. Their recluse situation, surrounded
   by the sea, preserves them from the calamities of war, and keeps them in
   the dark as to the conduct of their own armies. They see not, therefore
   they feel not. They tell the tale that is told them and believe it, and
   accustomed to no other news than their own, they receive it, stripped of
   its horrors and prepared for the palate of the nation, through the channel
   of the London Gazette. They are made to believe that their generals and
   armies differ from those of other nations, and have nothing of rudeness or
   barbarity in them. They suppose them what they wish them to be. They feel
   a disgrace in thinking otherwise, and naturally encourage the belief from
   a partiality to themselves. There was a time when I felt the same
   prejudices, and reasoned from the same errors; but experience, sad and
   painful experience, has taught me better. What the conduct of former
   armies was, I know not, but what the conduct of the present is, I well
   know. It is low, cruel, indolent and profligate; and had the people of
   America no other cause for separation than what the army has occasioned,
   that alone is cause sufficient.

   The field of politics in England is far more extensive than that of news.
   Men have a right to reason for themselves, and though they cannot
   contradict the intelligence in the London Gazette, they may frame upon it
   what sentiments they please. But the misfortune is, that a general
   ignorance has prevailed over the whole nation respecting America. The
   ministry and the minority have both been wrong. The former was always so,
   the latter only lately so. Politics, to be executively right, must have a
   unity of means and time, and a defect in either overthrows the whole. The
   ministry rejected the plans of the minority while they were practicable,
   and joined in them when they became impracticable. From wrong measures
   they got into wrong time, and have now completed the circle of absurdity
   by closing it upon themselves.

   I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of
   hostilities. I found the disposition of the people such, that they might
   have been led by a thread and governed by a reed. Their suspicion was
   quick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate, and
   it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it. They disliked
   the ministry, but they esteemed the nation. Their idea of grievance
   operated without resentment, and their single object was reconciliation.
   Bad as I believed the ministry to be, I never conceived them capable of a
   measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of hostilities; much less did
   I imagine the nation would encourage it. I viewed the dispute as a kind of
   law-suit, in which I supposed the parties would find a way either to
   decide or settle it. I had no thoughts of independence or of arms. The
   world could not then have persuaded me that I should be either a soldier
   or an author. If I had any talents for either, they were buried in me, and
   might ever have continued so, had not the necessity of the times dragged
   and driven them into action. I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving
   myself happy, wished every body else so. But when the country, into which
   I had just set my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to
   stir. It was time for every man to stir. Those who had been long settled
   had something to defend; those who had just come had something to pursue;
   and the call and the concern was equal and universal. For in a country
   where all men were once adventurers, the difference of a few years in
   their arrival could make none in their right.

   The breaking out of hostilities opened a new suspicion in the politics of
   America, which, though at that time very rare, has since been proved to be
   very right. What I allude to is, "a secret and fixed determination in the
   British Cabinet to annex America to the crown of England as a conquered
   country." If this be taken as the object, then the whole line of conduct
   pursued by the ministry, though rash in its origin and ruinous in its
   consequences, is nevertheless uniform and consistent in its parts. It
   applies to every case and resolves every difficulty. But if taxation, or
   any thing else, be taken in its room, there is no proportion between the
   object and the charge. Nothing but the whole soil and property of the
   country can be placed as a possible equivalent against the millions which
   the ministry expended. No taxes raised in America could possibly repay it.
   A revenue of two millions sterling a year would not discharge the sum and
   interest accumulated thereon, in twenty years.

   Reconciliation never appears to have been the wish or the object of the
   administration; they looked on conquest as certain and infallible, and,
   under that persuasion, sought to drive the Americans into what they might
   style a general rebellion, and then, crushing them with arms in their
   hands, reap the rich harvest of a general confiscation, and silence them
   for ever. The dependents at court were too numerous to be provided for in
   England. The market for plunder in the East Indies was over; and the
   profligacy of government required that a new mine should be opened, and
   that mine could be no other than America, conquered and forfeited. They
   had no where else to go. Every other channel was drained; and
   extravagance, with the thirst of a drunkard, was gaping for supplies.

   If the ministry deny this to have been their plan, it becomes them to
   explain what was their plan. For either they have abused us in coveting
   property they never labored for, or they have abused you in expending an
   amazing sum upon an incompetent object. Taxation, as I mentioned before,
   could never be worth the charge of obtaining it by arms; and any kind of
   formal obedience which America could have made, would have weighed with
   the lightness of a laugh against such a load of expense. It is therefore
   most probable that the ministry will at last justify their policy by their
   dishonesty, and openly declare, that their original design was conquest:
   and, in this case, it well becomes the people of England to consider how
   far the nation would have been benefited by the success.

   In a general view, there are few conquests that repay the charge of making
   them, and mankind are pretty well convinced that it can never be worth
   their while to go to war for profit's sake. If they are made war upon,
   their country invaded, or their existence at stake, it is their duty to
   defend and preserve themselves, but in every other light, and from every
   other cause, is war inglorious and detestable. But to return to the case
   in question-

   When conquests are made of foreign countries, it is supposed that the
   commerce and dominion of the country which made them are extended. But
   this could neither be the object nor the consequence of the present war.
   You enjoyed the whole commerce before. It could receive no possible
   addition by a conquest, but on the contrary, must diminish as the
   inhabitants were reduced in numbers and wealth. You had the same dominion
   over the country which you used to have, and had no complaint to make
   against her for breach of any part of the contract between you or her, or
   contending against any established custom, commercial, political or
   territorial. The country and commerce were both your own when you began to
   conquer, in the same manner and form as they had been your own a hundred
   years before. Nations have sometimes been induced to make conquests for
   the sake of reducing the power of their enemies, or bringing it to a
   balance with their own. But this could be no part of your plan. No foreign
   authority was claimed here, neither was any such authority suspected by
   you, or acknowledged or imagined by us. What then, in the name of heaven,
   could you go to war for? Or what chance could you possibly have in the
   event, but either to hold the same country which you held before, and that
   in a much worse condition, or to lose, with an amazing expense, what you
   might have retained without a farthing of charges?

   War never can be the interest of a trading nation, any more than
   quarrelling can be profitable to a man in business. But to make war with
   those who trade with us, is like setting a bull-dog upon a customer at the
   shop-door. The least degree of common sense shows the madness of the
   latter, and it will apply with the same force of conviction to the former.
   Piratical nations, having neither commerce or commodities of their own to
   lose, may make war upon all the world, and lucratively find their account
   in it; but it is quite otherwise with Britain: for, besides the stoppage
   of trade in time of war, she exposes more of her own property to be lost,
   than she has the chance of taking from others. Some ministerial gentlemen
   in parliament have mentioned the greatness of her trade as an apology for
   the greatness of her loss. This is miserable politics indeed! Because it
   ought to have been given as a reason for her not engaging in a war at
   first. The coast of America commands the West India trade almost as
   effectually as the coast of Africa does that of the Straits; and England
   can no more carry on the former without the consent of America, than she
   can the latter without a Mediterranean pass.

   In whatever light the war with America is considered upon commercial
   principles, it is evidently the interest of the people of England not to
   support it; and why it has been supported so long, against the clearest
   demonstrations of truth and national advantage, is, to me, and must be to
   all the reasonable world, a matter of astonishment. Perhaps it may be said
   that I live in America, and write this from interest. To this I reply,
   that my principle is universal. My attachment is to all the world, and not
   to any particular part, and if what I advance is right, no matter where or
   who it comes from. We have given the proclamation of your commissioners a
   currency in our newspapers, and I have no doubt you will give this a place
   in yours. To oblige and be obliged is fair.

   Before I dismiss this part of my address, I shall mention one more
   circumstance in which I think the people of England have been equally
   mistaken: and then proceed to other matters.

   There is such an idea existing in the world, as that of national honor,
   and this, falsely understood, is oftentimes the cause of war. In a
   Christian and philosophical sense, mankind seem to have stood still at
   individual civilization, and to retain as nations all the original
   rudeness of nature. Peace by treaty is only a cessation of violence for a
   reformation of sentiment. It is a substitute for a principle that is
   wanting and ever will be wanting till the idea of national honor be
   rightly understood. As individuals we profess ourselves Christians, but as
   nations we are heathens, Romans, and what not. I remember the late Admiral
   Saunders declaring in the House of Commons, and that in the time of peace,
   "That the city of Madrid laid in ashes was not a sufficient atonement for
   the Spaniards taking off the rudder of an English sloop of war." I do not
   ask whether this is Christianity or morality, I ask whether it is decency?
   whether it is proper language for a nation to use? In private life we call
   it by the plain name of bullying, and the elevation of rank cannot alter
   its character. It is, I think, exceedingly easy to define what ought to be
   understood by national honor; for that which is the best character for an
   individual is the best character for a nation; and wherever the latter
   exceeds or falls beneath the former, there is a departure from the line of
   true greatness.

   I have thrown out this observation with a design of applying it to Great
   Britain. Her ideas of national honor seem devoid of that benevolence of
   heart, that universal expansion of philanthropy, and that triumph over the
   rage of vulgar prejudice, without which man is inferior to himself, and a
   companion of common animals. To know who she shall regard or dislike, she
   asks what country they are of, what religion they profess, and what
   property they enjoy. Her idea of national honor seems to consist in
   national insult, and that to be a great people, is to be neither a
   Christian, a philosopher, or a gentleman, but to threaten with the
   rudeness of a bear, and to devour with the ferocity of a lion. This
   perhaps may sound harsh and uncourtly, but it is too true, and the more is
   the pity.

   I mention this only as her general character. But towards America she has
   observed no character at all; and destroyed by her conduct what she
   assumed in her title. She set out with the title of parent, or mother
   country. The association of ideas which naturally accompany this
   expression, are filled with everything that is fond, tender and
   forbearing. They have an energy peculiar to themselves, and, overlooking
   the accidental attachment of common affections, apply with infinite
   softness to the first feelings of the heart. It is a political term which
   every mother can feel the force of, and every child can judge of. It needs
   no painting of mine to set it off, for nature only can do it justice.

   But has any part of your conduct to America corresponded with the title
   you set up? If in your general national character you are unpolished and
   severe, in this you are inconsistent and unnatural, and you must have
   exceeding false notions of national honor to suppose that the world can
   admire a want of humanity or that national honor depends on the violence
   of resentment, the inflexibility of temper, or the vengeance of execution.

   I would willingly convince you, and that with as much temper as the times
   will suffer me to do, that as you opposed your own interest by quarrelling
   with us, so likewise your national honor, rightly conceived and
   understood, was no ways called upon to enter into a war with America; had
   you studied true greatness of heart, the first and fairest ornament of
   mankind, you would have acted directly contrary to all that you have done,
   and the world would have ascribed it to a generous cause. Besides which,
   you had (though with the assistance of this country) secured a powerful
   name by the last war. You were known and dreaded abroad; and it would have
   been wise in you to have suffered the world to have slept undisturbed
   under that idea. It was to you a force existing without expense. It
   produced to you all the advantages of real power; and you were stronger
   through the universality of that charm, than any future fleets and armies
   may probably make you. Your greatness was so secured and interwoven with
   your silence that you ought never to have awakened mankind, and had
   nothing to do but to be quiet. Had you been true politicians you would
   have seen all this, and continued to draw from the magic of a name, the
   force and authority of a nation.

   Unwise as you were in breaking the charm, you were still more unwise in
   the manner of doing it. Samson only told the secret, but you have
   performed the operation; you have shaven your own head, and wantonly
   thrown away the locks. America was the hair from which the charm was drawn
   that infatuated the world. You ought to have quarrelled with no power; but
   with her upon no account. You had nothing to fear from any condescension
   you might make. You might have humored her, even if there had been no
   justice in her claims, without any risk to your reputation; for Europe,
   fascinated by your fame, would have ascribed it to your benevolence, and
   America, intoxicated by the grant, would have slumbered in her fetters.

   But this method of studying the progress of the passions, in order to
   ascertain the probable conduct of mankind, is a philosophy in politics
   which those who preside at St. James's have no conception of. They know no
   other influence than corruption and reckon all their probabilities from
   precedent. A new case is to them a new world, and while they are seeking
   for a parallel they get lost. The talents of Lord Mansfield can be
   estimated at best no higher than those of a sophist. He understands the
   subtleties but not the elegance of nature; and by continually viewing
   mankind through the cold medium of the law, never thinks of penetrating
   into the warmer region of the mind. As for Lord North, it is his happiness
   to have in him more philosophy than sentiment, for he bears flogging like
   a top, and sleeps the better for it. His punishment becomes his support,
   for while he suffers the lash for his sins, he keeps himself up by
   twirling about. In politics, he is a good arithmetician, and in every
   thing else nothing at all.

   There is one circumstance which comes so much within Lord North's province
   as a financier, that I am surprised it should escape him, which is, the
   different abilities of the two countries in supporting the expense; for,
   strange as it may seem, England is not a match for America in this
   particular. By a curious kind of revolution in accounts, the people of
   England seem to mistake their poverty for their riches; that is, they
   reckon their national debt as a part of their national wealth. They make
   the same kind of error which a man would do, who after mortgaging his
   estate, should add the money borrowed, to the full value of the estate, in
   order to count up his worth, and in this case he would conceive that he
   got rich by running into debt. Just thus it is with England. The
   government owed at the beginning of this war one hundred and thirty-five
   millions sterling, and though the individuals to whom it was due had a
   right to reckon their shares as so much private property, yet to the
   nation collectively it was so much poverty. There are as effectual limits
   to public debts as to private ones, for when once the money borrowed is so
   great as to require the whole yearly revenue to discharge the interest
   thereon, there is an end to further borrowing; in the same manner as when
   the interest of a man's debts amounts to the yearly income of his estate,
   there is an end to his credit. This is nearly the case with England, the
   interest of her present debt being at least equal to one half of her
   yearly revenue, so that out of ten millions annually collected by taxes,
   she has but five that she can call her own.

   The very reverse of this was the case with America; she began the war
   without any debt upon her, and in order to carry it on, she neither raised
   money by taxes, nor borrowed it upon interest, but created it; and her
   situation at this time continues so much the reverse of yours that taxing
   would make her rich, whereas it would make you poor. When we shall have
   sunk the sum which we have created, we shall then be out of debt, be just
   as rich as when we began, and all the while we are doing it shall feel no
   difference, because the value will rise as the quantity decreases.

   There was not a country in the world so capable of bearing the expense of
   a war as America; not only because she was not in debt when she began, but
   because the country is young and capable of infinite improvement, and has
   an almost boundless tract of new lands in store; whereas England has got
   to her extent of age and growth, and has not unoccupied land or property
   in reserve. The one is like a young heir coming to a large improvable
   estate; the other like an old man whose chances are over, and his estate
   mortgaged for half its worth.

   In the second number of the Crisis, which I find has been republished in
   England, I endeavored to set forth the impracticability of conquering
   America. I stated every case, that I conceived could possibly happen, and
   ventured to predict its consequences. As my conclusions were drawn not
   artfully, but naturally, they have all proved to be true. I was upon the
   spot; knew the politics of America, her strength and resources, and by a
   train of services, the best in my power to render, was honored with the
   friendship of the congress, the army and the people. I considered the
   cause a just one. I know and feel it a just one, and under that confidence
   never made my own profit or loss an object. My endeavor was to have the
   matter well understood on both sides, and I conceived myself tendering a
   general service, by setting forth to the one the impossibility of being
   conquered, and to the other the impossibility of conquering. Most of the
   arguments made use of by the ministry for supporting the war, are the very
   arguments that ought to have been used against supporting it; and the
   plans, by which they thought to conquer, are the very plans in which they
   were sure to be defeated. They have taken every thing up at the wrong end.
   Their ignorance is astonishing, and were you in my situation you would see
   it. They may, perhaps, have your confidence, but I am persuaded that they
   would make very indifferent members of Congress. I know what England is,
   and what America is, and from the compound of knowledge, am better enabled
   to judge of the issue than what the king or any of his ministers can be.

   In this number I have endeavored to show the ill policy and disadvantages
   of the war. I believe many of my remarks are new. Those which are not so,
   I have studied to improve and place in a manner that may be clear and
   striking. Your failure is, I am persuaded, as certain as fate. America is
   above your reach. She is at least your equal in the world, and her
   independence neither rests upon your consent, nor can it be prevented by
   your arms. In short, you spend your substance in vain, and impoverish
   yourselves without a hope.

   But suppose you had conquered America, what advantages, collectively or
   individually, as merchants, manufacturers, or conquerors, could you have
   looked for? This is an object you seemed never to have attended to.
   Listening for the sound of victory, and led away by the frenzy of arms,
   you neglected to reckon either the cost or the consequences. You must all
   pay towards the expense; the poorest among you must bear his share, and it
   is both your right and your duty to weigh seriously the matter. Had
   America been conquered, she might have been parcelled out in grants to the
   favorites at court, but no share of it would have fallen to you. Your
   taxes would not have been lessened, because she would have been in no
   condition to have paid any towards your relief. We are rich by contrivance
   of our own, which would have ceased as soon as you became masters. Our
   paper money will be of no use in England, and silver and gold we have
   none. In the last war you made many conquests, but were any of your taxes
   lessened thereby? On the contrary, were you not taxed to pay for the
   charge of making them, and has not the same been the case in every war?

   To the Parliament I wish to address myself in a more particular manner.
   They appear to have supposed themselves partners in the chase, and to have
   hunted with the lion from an expectation of a right in the booty; but in
   this it is most probable they would, as legislators, have been
   disappointed. The case is quite a new one, and many unforeseen
   difficulties would have arisen thereon. The Parliament claimed a
   legislative right over America, and the war originated from that pretence.
   But the army is supposed to belong to the crown, and if America had been
   conquered through their means, the claim of the legislature would have
   been suffocated in the conquest. Ceded, or conquered, countries are
   supposed to be out of the authority of Parliament. Taxation is exercised
   over them by prerogative and not by law. It was attempted to be done in
   the Grenadas a few years ago, and the only reason why it was not done was
   because the crown had made a prior relinquishment of its claim. Therefore,
   Parliament have been all this while supporting measures for the
   establishment of their authority, in the issue of which, they would have
   been triumphed over by the prerogative. This might have opened a new and
   interesting opposition between the Parliament and the crown. The crown
   would have said that it conquered for itself, and that to conquer for
   Parliament was an unknown case. The Parliament might have replied, that
   America not being a foreign country, but a country in rebellion, could not
   be said to be conquered, but reduced; and thus continued their claim by
   disowning the term. The crown might have rejoined, that however America
   might be considered at first, she became foreign at last by a declaration
   of independence, and a treaty with France; and that her case being, by
   that treaty, put within the law of nations, was out of the law of
   Parliament, who might have maintained, that as their claim over America
   had never been surrendered, so neither could it be taken away. The crown
   might have insisted, that though the claim of Parliament could not be
   taken away, yet, being an inferior, it might be superseded; and that,
   whether the claim was withdrawn from the object, or the object taken from
   the claim, the same separation ensued; and that America being subdued
   after a treaty with France, was to all intents and purposes a regal
   conquest, and of course the sole property of the king. The Parliament, as
   the legal delegates of the people, might have contended against the term
   "inferior," and rested the case upon the antiquity of power, and this
   would have brought on a set of very interesting and rational questions.

   1st, What is the original fountain of power and honor in any country?
   2d, Whether the prerogative does not belong to the people?
   3d, Whether there is any such thing as the English constitution?
   4th, Of what use is the crown to the people?
   5th, Whether he who invented a crown was not an enemy to mankind?
   6th, Whether it is not a shame for a man to spend a million a year
   and do no good for it, and whether the money might not be better applied?
   7th, Whether such a man is not better dead than alive?
   8th, Whether a Congress, constituted like that of America, is not the most
   happy and consistent form of government in the world?- With a number of
   others of the same import.

   In short, the contention about the dividend might have distracted the
   nation; for nothing is more common than to agree in the conquest and
   quarrel for the prize; therefore it is, perhaps, a happy circumstance,
   that our successes have prevented the dispute.

   If the Parliament had been thrown out in their claim, which it is most
   probable they would, the nation likewise would have been thrown out in
   their expectation; for as the taxes would have been laid on by the crown
   without the Parliament, the revenue arising therefrom, if any could have
   arisen, would not have gone into the exchequer, but into the privy purse,
   and so far from lessening the taxes, would not even have been added to
   them, but served only as pocket money to the crown. The more I reflect on
   this matter, the more I am satisfied at the blindness and ill policy of my
   countrymen, whose wisdom seems to operate without discernment, and their
   strength without an object.

   To the great bulwark of the nation, I mean the mercantile and
   manufacturing part thereof, I likewise present my address. It is your
   interest to see America an independent, and not a conquered country. If
   conquered, she is ruined; and if ruined, poor; consequently the trade will
   be a trifle, and her credit doubtful. If independent, she flourishes, and
   from her flourishing must your profits arise. It matters nothing to you
   who governs America, if your manufactures find a consumption there. Some
   articles will consequently be obtained from other places, and it is right
   that they should; but the demand for others will increase, by the great
   influx of inhabitants which a state of independence and peace will
   occasion, and in the final event you may be enriched. The commerce of
   America is perfectly free, and ever will be so. She will consign away no
   part of it to any nation. She has not to her friends, and certainly will
   not to her enemies; though it is probable that your narrow-minded
   politicians, thinking to please you thereby, may some time or other
   unnecessarily make such a proposal. Trade flourishes best when it is free,
   and it is weak policy to attempt to fetter it. Her treaty with France is
   on the most liberal and generous principles, and the French, in their
   conduct towards her, have proved themselves to be philosophers,
   politicians, and gentlemen.

   To the ministry I likewise address myself. You, gentlemen, have studied
   the ruin of your country, from which it is not within your abilities to
   rescue her. Your attempts to recover her are as ridiculous as your plans
   which involved her are detestable. The commissioners, being about to
   depart, will probably bring you this, and with it my sixth number,
   addressed to them; and in so doing they carry back more Common Sense than
   they brought, and you likewise will have more than when you sent them.

   Having thus addressed you severally, I conclude by addressing you
   collectively. It is a long lane that has no turning. A period of sixteen
   years of misconduct and misfortune, is certainly long enough for any one
   nation to suffer under; and upon a supposition that war is not declared
   between France and you, I beg to place a line of conduct before you that
   will easily lead you out of all your troubles. It has been hinted before,
   and cannot be too much attended to.

   Suppose America had remained unknown to Europe till the present year, and
   that Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, in another voyage round the world, had
   made the first discovery of her, in the same condition that she is now in,
   of arts, arms, numbers, and civilization. What, I ask, in that case, would
   have been your conduct towards her? For that will point out what it ought
   to be now. The problems and their solutions are equal, and the right line
   of the one is the parallel of the other. The question takes in every
   circumstance that can possibly arise. It reduces politics to a simple
   thought, and is moreover a mode of investigation, in which, while you are
   studying your interest the simplicity of the case will cheat you into good
   temper. You have nothing to do but to suppose that you have found America,
   and she appears found to your hand, and while in the joy of your heart you
   stand still to admire her, the path of politics rises straight before you.

   Were I disposed to paint a contrast, I could easily set off what you have
   done in the present case, against what you would have done in that case,
   and by justly opposing them, conclude a picture that would make you blush.
   But, as, when any of the prouder passions are hurt, it is much better
   philosophy to let a man slip into a good temper than to attack him in a
   bad one, for that reason, therefore, I only state the case, and leave you
   to reflect upon it.

   To go a little back into politics, it will be found that the true interest
   of Britain lay in proposing and promoting the independence of America
   immediately after the last peace; for the expense which Britain had then
   incurred by defending America as her own dominions, ought to have shown
   her the policy and necessity of changing the style of the country, as the
   best probable method of preventing future wars and expense, and the only
   method by which she could hold the commerce without the charge of
   sovereignty. Besides which, the title which she assumed, of parent
   country, led to, and pointed out the propriety, wisdom and advantage of a
   separation; for, as in private life, children grow into men, and by
   setting up for themselves, extend and secure the interest of the whole
   family, so in the settlement of colonies large enough to admit of
   maturity, the same policy should be pursued, and the same consequences
   would follow. Nothing hurts the affections both of parents and children so
   much, as living too closely connected, and keeping up the distinction too
   long. Domineering will not do over those, who, by a progress in life, have
   become equal in rank to their parents, that is, when they have families of
   their own; and though they may conceive themselves the subjects of their
   advice, will not suppose them the objects of their government. I do not,
   by drawing this parallel, mean to admit the title of parent country,
   because, if it is due any where, it is due to Europe collectively, and the
   first settlers from England were driven here by persecution. I mean only
   to introduce the term for the sake of policy and to show from your title
   the line of your interest.

   When you saw the state of strength and opulence, and that by her own
   industry, which America arrived at, you ought to have advised her to set
   up for herself, and proposed an alliance of interest with her, and in so
   doing you would have drawn, and that at her own expense, more real
   advantage, and more military supplies and assistance, both of ships and
   men, than from any weak and wrangling government that you could exercise
   over her. In short, had you studied only the domestic politics of a
   family, you would have learned how to govern the state; but, instead of
   this easy and natural line, you flew out into every thing which was wild
   and outrageous, till, by following the passion and stupidity of the pilot,
   you wrecked the vessel within sight of the shore.

   Having shown what you ought to have done, I now proceed to show why it was
   not done. The caterpillar circle of the court had an interest to pursue,
   distinct from, and opposed to yours; for though by the independence of
   America and an alliance therewith, the trade would have continued, if not
   increased, as in many articles neither country can go to a better market,
   and though by defending and protecting herself, she would have been no
   expense to you, and consequently your national charges would have
   decreased, and your taxes might have been proportionably lessened thereby;
   yet the striking off so many places from the court calendar was put in
   opposition to the interest of the nation. The loss of thirteen government
   ships, with their appendages, here and in England, is a shocking sound in
   the ear of a hungry courtier. Your present king and ministry will be the
   ruin of you; and you had better risk a revolution and call a Congress,
   than be thus led on from madness to despair, and from despair to ruin.
   America has set you the example, and you may follow it and be free.

   I now come to the last part, a war with France. This is what no man in his
   senses will advise you to, and all good men would wish to prevent. Whether
   France will declare war against you, is not for me in this place to
   mention, or to hint, even if I knew it; but it must be madness in you to
   do it first. The matter is come now to a full crisis, and peace is easy if
   willingly set about. Whatever you may think, France has behaved handsomely
   to you. She would have been unjust to herself to have acted otherwise than
   she did; and having accepted our offer of alliance she gave you genteel
   notice of it. There was nothing in her conduct reserved or indelicate, and
   while she announced her determination to support her treaty, she left you
   to give the first offence. America, on her part, has exhibited a character
   of firmness to the world. Unprepared and unarmed, without form or
   government, she, singly opposed a nation that domineered over half the
   globe. The greatness of the deed demands respect; and though you may feel
   resentment, you are compelled both to wonder and admire.

   Here I rest my arguments and finish my address. Such as it is, it is a
   gift, and you are welcome. It was always my design to dedicate a Crisis to
   you, when the time should come that would properly make it a Crisis; and
   when, likewise, I should catch myself in a temper to write it, and suppose
   you in a condition to read it. That time has now arrived, and with it the
   opportunity for conveyance. For the commissioners- poor commissioners!
   having proclaimed, that "yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown,"
   have waited out the date, and, discontented with their God, are returning
   to their gourd. And all the harm I wish them is, that it may not wither
   about their ears, and that they may not make their exit in the belly of a
   whale.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 21, 1778.

   P.S.- Though in the tranquillity of my mind I have concluded with a laugh,
   yet I have something to mention to the commissioners, which, to them, is
   serious and worthy their attention. Their authority is derived from an Act
   of Parliament, which likewise describes and limits their official powers.
   Their commission, therefore, is only a recital, and personal investiture,
   of those powers, or a nomination and description of the persons who are to
   execute them. Had it contained any thing contrary to, or gone beyond the
   line of, the written law from which it is derived, and by which it is
   bound, it would, by the English constitution, have been treason in the
   crown, and the king been subject to an impeachment. He dared not,
   therefore, put in his commission what you have put in your proclamation,
   that is, he dared not have authorised you in that commission to burn and
   destroy any thing in America. You are both in the act and in the
   commission styled commissioners for restoring peace, and the methods for
   doing it are there pointed out. Your last proclamation is signed by you as
   commissioners under that act. You make Parliament the patron of its
   contents. Yet, in the body of it, you insert matters contrary both to the
   spirit and letter of the act, and what likewise your king dared not have
   put in his commission to you. The state of things in England, gentlemen,
   is too ticklish for you to run hazards. You are accountable to Parliament
   for the execution of that act according to the letter of it. Your heads
   may pay for breaking it, for you certainly have broke it by exceeding it.
   And as a friend, who would wish you to escape the paw of the lion, as well
   as the belly of the whale, I civilly hint to you, to keep within compass.

   Sir Harry Clinton, strictly speaking, is as accountable as the rest; for
   though a general, he is likewise a commissioner, acting under a superior
   authority. His first obedience is due to the act; and his plea of being a
   general, will not and cannot clear him as a commissioner, for that would
   suppose the crown, in its single capacity, to have a power of dispensing
   with an Act of Parliament. Your situation, gentlemen, is nice and
   critical, and the more so because England is unsettled. Take heed!
   Remember the times of Charles the First! For Laud and Stafford fell by
   trusting to a hope like yours.

   Having thus shown you the danger of your proclamation, I now show you the
   folly of it. The means contradict your design: you threaten to lay waste,
   in order to render America a useless acquisition of alliance to France. I
   reply, that the more destruction you commit (if you could do it) the more
   valuable to France you make that alliance. You can destroy only houses and
   goods; and by so doing you increase our demand upon her for materials and
   merchandise; for the wants of one nation, provided it has freedom and
   credit, naturally produce riches to the other; and, as you can neither
   ruin the land nor prevent the vegetation, you would increase the
   exportation of our produce in payment, which would be to her a new fund of
   wealth. In short, had you cast about for a plan on purpose to enrich your
   enemies, you could not have hit upon a better.

   C. S.
