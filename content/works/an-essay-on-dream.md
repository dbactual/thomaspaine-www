                               AN ESSAY ON DREAM

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This essay was first published in Paris after Paine's departure for
   America in 1802. Its title read: Extract from the M.S. Third Part of
   Thomas Paine's Age of Reason. Chapter the Second: Article, Dream. Paris:
   Printed for M. Chateau, 1803. In 1807 it was published as the introductory
   chapter to Paine's Examination of the Prophecies, immediately following
   the "Author's Preface." Part of the essay was omitted by Paine when he
   published it in America (marked off by *** in the text below).

                                   ---------

   AS a great deal is said in the New Testament about dreams, it is first
   necessary to explain the nature of Dream, and to show by what operation of
   the mind a dream is produced during sleep.

   When this is understood we shall be the better enabled to judge whether
   any reliance can be placed upon them; and consequently, whether the
   several matters in the New Testament related of dreams deserve the credit
   which the writers of that book and priests and commentators ascribe to
   them.

   In order to understand the nature of Dream, or of that which passes in
   ideal vision during a state of sleep, it is first necessary to understand
   the composition and decomposition of the human mind.

   The three great faculties of the mind are IMAGINATION, JUDGMENT and
   MEMORY. Every action of the mind comes under one or the other of these
   faculties. In a state of wakefulness, as in the day-time, these three
   faculties are all active; but that is seldom the case in sleep, and never
   perfectly: and this is the cause that our dreams are not so regular and
   rational as our waking thoughts.

   The seat of that collection of powers or faculties that constitute what is
   called the mind is in the brain. There is not, and cannot be, any visible
   demonstration of this anatomically, but accidents happening to living
   persons show it to be so. An injury done to the brain by a fracture of the
   skull will sometimes change a wise man into a childish idiot-a being
   without a mind. But so careful has nature been of that sanctum sanctorum
   of man, the brain, that of all the external accidents to which humanity is
   subject, this occurs the most seldom. But we often see it happening by
   long and habitual intemperance.

   Whether those three faculties occupy distinct apartments of the brain, is
   known only to that ALMIGHTY POWER that formed and organized it. We can see
   the external effects of muscular motion in all the members of the body,
   though its primum mobile, or first moving cause, is un- known to man.

   Our external motions are sometimes the effect of intention, sometimes not.
   If we are sitting and intend to rise, or standing and intend to sit or to
   walk, the limbs obey that intention as if they heard the order given. But
   we make a thousand motions every day, and that as well waking as sleeping,
   that have no prior intention to direct them. Each member acts as if it had
   a will or mind of its own.

   Man governs the whole when he pleases to govern, but in the interim the
   several parts, like little suburbs, govern themselves without consulting
   the sovereign.

   And all these motions, whatever be the generating cause, are external and
   visible. But with respect to the brain, no ocular observation can be made
   upon it. All is mystery; all is darkness in that womb of thought.

   Whether the brain is a mass of matter in continual rest; whether it has a
   vibrating, pulsative motion, or a heaving and falling motion like matter
   in fermentation; whether different parts of the brain have different
   motions according to the faculty that is employed, be it the imagination,
   the judgment, or the memory, man knows nothing of. He knows not the cause
   of his own wit. His own brain conceals it from him.

   Comparing invisible by visible things, as metaphysical can sometimes be
   compared to physical things, the operations of these distinct and several
   faculties have some resemblance to a watch. The main spring which puts all
   in motion corresponds to the imagination; the pendulum which corrects and
   regulates that motion corresponds to the judgment; and the hand and dial,
   like the memory, record the operation.

   Now in proportion as these several faculties sleep, slumber, or keep
   awake, during the continuance of a dream, in that proportion the dream
   will be reasonable or frantic, remembered or forgotten.

   If there is any faculty in mental man that never sleeps it is that
   volatile thing the imagination. The case is different with the judgment
   and memory. The sedate and sober constitution of the judgment easily
   disposes it to rest; and as to the memory, it records in silence and is
   active only when it is called upon.

   That the judgment soon goes to sleep may be perceived by our sometimes
   beginning to dream before we are fully asleep ourselves. Some random
   thought runs in the mind and we start, as it were, into recollection that
   we are dreaming between sleeping and waking.

   If a pendulum of a watch by any accident becomes so displaced that it can
   no longer control and regulate the elastic force of the spring, the works
   are instantly thrown into confusion, and continue so as long as the spring
   continues to have force.

   In like manner if the judgment sleeps while the imagination keeps awake,
   the dream will be a riotous assemblage of misshapen images and ranting
   ideas, and the more active the imagination is the wilder the dream will
   be. The most inconsistent and the most impossible things will appear
   right; because that faculty whose province it is to keep order is in a
   state of absence. The master of the school is gone out and the boys are in
   an uproar.

   If the memory sleeps, we shall have no other knowledge of the dream than
   that we have dreamt, without knowing what it was about. In this case it is
   sensation rather than recollection that acts. The dream has given us some
   sense of pain or trouble, and we feel it as a hurt, rather than remember
   it as vision.

   If the memory slumbers we shall have a faint remembrance of the dream, and
   after a few minutes it will sometimes happen that the principal passages
   of the dream will occur to us more fully. The cause of this is that the
   memory will sometimes continue slumbering or sleeping after we are awake
   ourselves, and so fully that it may and sometimes does happen that we do
   not immediately recollect where we are, nor what we have been about, or
   have to do. But when the memory starts into wakefulness it brings the
   knowledge of these things back upon us like a flood of light, and
   sometimes the dream with it.

   But the most curious circumstance of the mind in a state of dream is the
   power it has to become the agent of every person, character and thing of
   which it dreams. It carries on conversation with several, asks questions,
   hears answers, gives and receives information, and it acts all these parts
   itself.

   Yet however various and eccentric the imagination may be in the creating
   of images and ideas, it cannot supply the place of memory with respect to
   things that are forgotten when we are awake. For example, if we have
   forgotten the name of a person, and dream of seeing him and asking him his
   name, he cannot tell it; for it is ourselves asking ourselves the
   question.

   But though the imagination cannot supply the place of real memory,  it has
   the wild faculty of counterfeiting memory. It dreams of persons it never
   knew, and talks to them as if it remembered them as old acquaintance. It
   relates circumstances that never happened, and tells them as if they had
   happened. It goes to places that never existed, and knows where all the
   streets and houses are, as if we had been there before. The scenes it
   creates are often as scenes remembered. It will sometimes act a dream
   within a dream, and, in the delusion of dreaming, tell a dream it never
   dreamed, and tell it as if it was from memory.

   It may also be remarked, that the imagination in a dream has no idea of
   time, as time. It counts only by circumstances; and if a succession of
   circumstances pass in a dream that would require a great length of time to
   accomplish them, it will appear to the dreamer that a length of time equal
   thereto has passed also.

   As this is the state of the mind in a dream, it may rationally be said
   that every person is mad once in twenty-four hours, for were he to act in
   the day as he dreams in the night, he would be confined for a lunatic. In
   a state of wakefulness, those three faculties being all active, and
   acting in unison, constitute the rational man.

   In dream it is otherwise, and, therefore, that state which is called
   insanity appears to be no other than a dismission of those faculties, and
   a cessation of the judgment during wakefulness that we so often experience
   during sleep; and idiocy, into which some persons have fallen, is that
   cessation of all the faculties of which we can be sensible when we happen
   to wake before our memory.

   In this view of the mind, how absurd it is to place reliance upon dreams,
   and how much more absurd to make them a foundation for religion; yet the
   belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, begotten by the Holy Ghost, a
   being never heard of before, stands on the foolish story of an old man's
   dream. "And behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream,
   saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not thou to take unto thee Mary
   thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost."-Matt,
   i, 20.

   After this we have the childish stories of three or four other dreams:
   about Joseph going into Egypt; about his coming back again; about this,
   and about that, and this story of dreams has thrown Europe into a dream
   for more than a thousand years.

   All the efforts that nature, reason and conscience have made to awaken man
   from it, have been ascribed by priestcraft and superstition to the working
   of the devil, and had it not been for the American Revolution, which, by
   establishing the universal right of conscience, first opened the way to
   free discussion, and for the French Revolution that followed, this
   Religion of Dreams had continued to be preached, and that after it had
   ceased to be believed. Those who preached it and did not believe it, still
   believe the delusion necessary. They were not bold enough to be honest,
   nor honest enough to be bold.

                                   **********

    Every new religion, like a new play, requires a new apparatus of dresses
   and machinery, to fit the new characters it creates. The story of Christ
   in the New Testament brings a new being upon the stage, which it calls the
   Holy Ghost; and the story of Abraham, the father of the Jews, in the Old
   Testament, gives existence to a new order of beings it calls angels. There
   was no Holy Ghost before the time of Christ, nor angels before the time of
   Abraham.

   We hear nothing of these winged gentlemen, till more than two thousand
   years, according to the Bible chronology, from the time they say the
   heavens, the earth and all therein were made. After this, they hop about
   as thick as birds in a grove. The first we hear of pays his addresses to
   Hagar in the wilderness; then three of them visit Sarah; another wrestles
   a fall with Jacob; and these birds of passage having found their way to
   earth and back, are continually coming and going. They eat and drink, and
   up again to heaven.

   What they do with the food they carry away in their bellies, the Bible
   does not tell us. Perhaps they do as the birds do, discharge it as they
   fly; for neither the Scripture nor the Church hath told us there are
   necessary houses for them in heaven. One would think that a system loaded
   with such gross and vulgar absurdities as Scripture religion is could
   never have obtained credit; yet we have seen what priestcraft and
   fanaticism could do, and credulity believe.

   From angels in the Old Testament we get to prophets, to witches, to seers
   of visions, and dreamers of dreams; and sometimes we are told, as in I
   Samuel ix, 15, that God whispers in the ear. At other times we are not
   told how the impulse was given, or whether sleeping or waking. In II
   Samuel xxiv, 1, it is said, "And again the anger of the Lord was kindled
   against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go number Israel
   and Judah." And in I Chronicles xxi, 1, when the same story is again
   related, it is said, "And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David
   to number Israel"

   Whether this was done sleeping or waking, we are not told, but it seems
   that David, whom they call "a man after God's own heart," did not know by
   what spirit he was moved; and as to the men called inspired penmen, they
   agree so well about the matter that in one book they say it was God, and
   in the other that it was the devil.

   Yet this is trash that the Church imposes upon the world as the WORD OF
   GOD; this is the collection of lies and contradictions called the HOLY
   BIBLE! this is the rubbish called REVEALED RELIGION!

   The idea that writers of the Old Testament had of a God was boisterous,
   contemptible, and vulgar. They make Him the Mars of the Jews, the fighting
   God of Israel, the conjuring God of their priests and prophets. They tell
   us as many fables of Him as the Greeks told of Hercules. They pit Him
   against Pharaoh, as it were to box with him, and Moses carries the
   challenge. They make their God to say insultingly, "I will get me honor
   upon Pharaoh and upon all his host, upon his chariots and upon his
   horsemen." And that He may keep His word, they make Him set a trap in the
   Red Sea, in the dead of the night, for Pharaoh, his host and his horses,
   and drown them as a rat-catcher would do so many rats. Great honor indeed!
   the story of Jack the giant-killer is better told!

   They match Him against the Egyptian magicians to conjure with them, and
   after hard conjuring on both sides (for where there is no great contest
   there is no great honor) they bring Him off victorious. The first three
   essays are a dead match: each party turns his rod into a serpent, the
   rivers into blood, and creates frogs: but upon the fourth, the God of the
   Israelites obtains the laurel, He covers them all over with lice! The
   Egyptian magicians cannot do the same, and this lousy triumph proclaims
   the victory!

   They make their God to rain fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah,
   and belch fire and smoke upon Mount Sinai, as if He was the Pluto of the
   lower regions. They make Him salt up Lot's wife like pickled pork; they
   make Him pass like Shakespeare's Queen Mab into the brain of their
   priests, prophets and prophetesses, and tickle them into dreams, and after
   making Him play all kinds of tricks they confound Him with Satan, and
   leave us at a loss to know what God they meant!

   This is the descriptive God of the Old Testament; and as to the New,
   though the authors of it have varied the scene, they have continued the
   vulgarity.

   Is man ever to be the dupe of priestcraft, the slave of superstition? Is
   he never to have just ideas of his Creator? It is better not to believe
   there is a God than to believe of Him falsely. When we behold the mighty
   universe that surrounds us, and dart our contemplation into the eternity
   of space, filled with innumerable orbs revolving in eternal harmony, how
   paltry must the tales of the Old and New Testaments, profanely called the
   Word of God, appear to thoughtful man!

   The stupendous wisdom and unerring order that reign and govern throughout
   this wondrous whole, and call us to reflection, put to shame the Bible!
   The God of eternity and of all that is real, is not the god of passing
   dreams and shadows of man's imagination. The God of truth is not the god
   of fable; the belief of a god begotten and a god crucified, is a god
   blasphemed. It is making a profane use of reason.***

   I shall conclude this Essay on Dream with the first two verses of
   Ecclesiasticus xxxiv, one of the books of the Aprocrypha. "The hopes of a
   man void of understanding are vain and false; and dreams lift up fools.
   Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow and followeth
   after the wind."

   I now proceed to an examination of the passages in the Bible, called
   prophecies of the coming of Christ, and to show there are no prophecies of
   any such person; that the passages clandestinely styled prophecies are not
   prophecies; and that they refer to circumstances the Jewish nation was in
   at the time they were written or spoken, and not to any distance of future
   time or person.
