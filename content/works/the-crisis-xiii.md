   Foner's introduction:

   In April, 1783, the war came to an end and American independence was
   recognized by the British. "The times that tried men's souls are over,"
   Paine declares in the opening sentence of his last Crisis. Again as in his
   other articles, Paine warned his countrymen that everything in the future
   depended on the absolute sovereignty of the United States. This Crisis
   contains some of Paine's finest utterances in behalf of a centralized
   government, and a clearly formulated attack upon the theory of states'
   rights and sectional antagonisms.

   THOUGHTS ON THE PEACE, AND THE PROBABLE ADVANTAGES THEREOF

   "THE times that tried men's souls," * are over - and the greatest and
   completest revolution the world ever knew, gloriously and happily
   accomplished.

   But to pass from the extremes of danger to safety- from the tumult of war
   to the tranquillity of peace, though sweet in contemplation, requires a
   gradual composure of the senses to receive it. Even calmness has the power
   of stunning, when it opens too instantly upon us. The long and raging
   hurricane that should cease in a moment, would leave us in a state rather
   of wonder than enjoyment; and some moments of recollection must pass,
   before we could be capable of tasting the felicity of repose. There are
   but few instances, in which the mind is fitted for sudden transitions: it
   takes in its pleasures by reflection and comparison and those must have
   time to act, before the relish for new scenes is complete.

   In the present case- the mighty magnitude of the object- the various
   uncertainties of fate it has undergone- the numerous and complicated
   dangers we have suffered or escaped- the eminence we now stand on, and the
   vast prospect before us, must all conspire to impress us with
   contemplation.

   To see it in our power to make a world happy- to teach mankind the art of
   being so - to exhibit, on the theatre of the universe a character hitherto
   unknown- and to have, as it were, a new creation intrusted to our hands,
   are honors that command reflection, and can neither be too highly
   estimated, nor too gratefully received.

   In this pause then of recollection- while the storm is ceasing, and the
   long agitated mind vibrating to a rest, let us look back on the scenes we
   have passed, and learn from experience what is yet to be done.

   Never, I say, had a country so many openings to happiness as this. Her
   setting out in life, like the rising of a fair morning, was unclouded and
   promising. Her cause was good. Her principles just and liberal. Her temper
   serene and firm. Her conduct regulated by the nicest steps, and everything
   about her wore the mark of honor. It is not every country (perhaps there
   is not another in the world) that can boast so fair an origin. Even the
   first settlement of America corresponds with the character of the
   revolution. Rome, once the proud mistress of the universe, was originally
   a band of ruffians. Plunder and rapine made her rich, and her oppression
   of millions made her great. But America need never be ashamed to tell her
   birth, nor relate the stages by which she rose to empire.

   The remembrance, then, of what is past, if it operates rightly, must
   inspire her with the most laudable of all ambition, that of adding to the
   fair fame she began with. The world has seen her great in adversity;
   struggling, without a thought of yielding, beneath accumulated
   difficulties, bravely, nay proudly, encountering distress, and rising in
   resolution as the storm increased. All this is justly due to her, for her
   fortitude has merited the character. Let, then, the world see that she can
   bear prosperity: and that her honest virtue in time of peace, is equal to
   the bravest virtue in time of war.

   She is now descending to the scenes of quiet and domestic life. Not
   beneath the cypress shade of disappointment, but to enjoy in her own land,
   and under her own vine, the sweet of her labors, and the reward of her
   toil.- In this situation, may she never forget that a fair national
   reputation is of as much importance as independence. That it possesses a
   charm that wins upon the world, and makes even enemies civil. That it
   gives a dignity which is often superior to power, and commands reverence
   where pomp and splendor fail.

   It would be a circumstance ever to be lamented and never to be forgotten,
   were a single blot, from any cause whatever, suffered to fall on a
   revolution, which to the end of time must be an honor to the age that
   accomplished it: and which has contributed more to enlighten the world,
   and diffuse a spirit of freedom and liberality among mankind, than any
   human event (if this may be called one) that ever preceded it.

   It is not among the least of the calamities of a long continued war, that
   it unhinges the mind from those nice sensations which at other times
   appear so amiable. The continual spectacle of woe blunts the finer
   feelings, and the necessity of bearing with the sight, renders it
   familiar. In like manner, are many of the moral obligations of society
   weakened, till the custom of acting by necessity becomes an apology, where
   it is truly a crime. Yet let but a nation conceive rightly of its
   character, and it will be chastely just in protecting it. None ever began
   with a fairer than America and none can be under a greater obligation to
   preserve it.

   The debt which America has contracted, compared with the cause she has
   gained, and the advantages to flow from it, ought scarcely to be
   mentioned. She has it in her choice to do, and to live as happily as she
   pleases. The world is in her hands. She has no foreign power to monopolize
   her commerce, perplex her legislation, or control her prosperity. The
   struggle is over, which must one day have happened, and, perhaps, never
   could have happened at a better time.** And instead of a domineering
   master, she has gained an ally whose exemplary greatness, and universal
   liberality, have extorted a confession even from her enemies.

   With the blessings of peace, independence, and an universal commerce, the
   states, individually and collectively, will have leisure and opportunity
   to regulate and establish their domestic concerns, and to put it beyond
   the power of calumny to throw the least reflection on their honor.
   Character is much easier kept than recovered, and that man, if any such
   there be, who, from sinister views, or littleness of soul, lends unseen
   his hand to injure it, contrives a wound it will never be in his power to
   heal.

   As we have established an inheritance for posterity, let that inheritance
   descend, with every mark of an honorable conveyance. The little it will
   cost, compared with the worth of the states, the greatness of the object,
   and the value of the national character, will be a profitable exchange.

   But that which must more forcibly strike a thoughtful, penetrating mind,
   and which includes and renders easy all inferior concerns, is the UNION OF
   THE STATES. On this our great national character depends. It is this which
   must give us importance abroad and security at home. It is through this
   only that we are, or can be, nationally known in the world; it is the flag
   of the United States which renders our ships and commerce safe on the
   seas, or in a foreign port. Our Mediterranean passes must be obtained
   under the same style. All our treaties, whether of alliance, peace, or
   commerce, are formed under the sovereignty of the United States, and
   Europe knows us by no other name or title.

   The division of the empire into states is for our own convenience, but
   abroad this distinction ceases. The affairs of each state are local. They
   can go no further than to itself. And were the whole worth of even the
   richest of them expended in revenue, it would not be sufficient to support
   sovereignty against a foreign attack. In short, we have no other national
   sovereignty than as United States. It would even be fatal for us if we
   had- too expensive to be maintained, and impossible to be supported.
   Individuals, or individual states, may call themselves what they please;
   but the world, and especially the world of enemies, is not to be held in
   awe by the whistling of a name. Sovereignty must have power to protect all
   the parts that compose and constitute it: and as UNITED STATES we are
   equal to the importance of the title, but otherwise we are not. Our union,
   well and wisely regulated and cemented, is the cheapest way of being
   great- the easiest way of being powerful, and the happiest invention in
   government which the circumstances of America can admit of.- Because it
   collects from each state, that which, by being inadequate, can be of no
   use to it, and forms an aggregate that serves for all.

   The states of Holland are an unfortunate instance of the effects of
   individual sovereignty. Their disjointed condition exposes them to
   numerous intrigues, losses, calamities, and enemies; and the almost
   impossibility of bringing their measures to a decision, and that decision
   into execution, is to them, and would be to us, a source of endless
   misfortune.

   It is with confederated states as with individuals in society; something
   must be yielded up to make the whole secure. In this view of things we
   gain by what we give, and draw an annual interest greater than the
   capital.- I ever feel myself hurt when I hear the union, that great
   palladium of our liberty and safety, the least irreverently spoken of. It
   is the most sacred thing in the constitution of America, and that which
   every man should be most proud and tender of. Our citizenship in the
   United States is our national character. Our citizenship in any particular
   state is only our local distinction. By the latter we are known at home,
   by the former to the world. Our great title is AMERICANS - our inferior
   one varies with the place.

   So far as my endeavors could go, they have all been directed to conciliate
   the affections, unite the interests, and draw and keep the mind of the
   country together; and the better to assist in this foundation work of the
   revolution, I have avoided all places of profit or office, either in the
   state I live in, or in the United States; kept myself at a distance from
   all parties and party connections, and even disregarded all private and
   inferior concerns: and when we take into view the great work which we have
   gone through, and feel, as we ought to feel, the just importance of it, we
   shall then see, that the little wranglings and indecent contentions of
   personal parley, are as dishonorable to our characters, as they are
   injurious to our repose.

   It was the cause of America that made me an author. The force with which
   it struck my mind and the dangerous condition the country appeared to me
   in, by courting an impossible and an unnatural reconciliation with those
   who were determined to reduce her, instead of striking out into the only
   line that could cement and save her, A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, made
   it impossible for me, feeling as I did, to be silent: and if, in the
   course of more than seven years, I have rendered her any service, I have
   likewise added something to the reputation of literature, by freely and
   disinterestedly employing it in the great cause of mankind, and showing
   that there may be genius without prostitution.

   Independence always appeared to me practicable and probable, provided the
   sentiment of the country could be formed and held to the object: and there
   is no instance in the world, where a people so extended, and wedded to
   former habits of thinking, and under such a variety of circumstances, were
   so instantly and effectually pervaded, by a turn in politics, as in the
   case of independence; and who supported their opinion, undiminished,
   through such a succession of good and ill fortune, till they crowned it
   with success.

   But as the scenes of war are closed, and every man preparing for home and
   happier times, I therefore take my leave of the subject. I have most
   sincerely followed it from beginning to end, and through all its turns and
   windings: and whatever country I may hereafter be in, I shall always feel
   an honest pride at the part I have taken and acted, and a gratitude to
   nature and providence for putting it in my power to be of some use to
   mankind.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, April 19, 1783.

   * "These are the times that try men's souls", The Crisis No. I. published
   December, 1776 - Author

   ** That the revolution began at the exact period of time best fitted to
   the purpose, is sufficiently proved by the event.- But the great hinge on
   which the whole machine turned, is the Union of the States: and this union
   was naturally produced by the inability of any one state to support itself
   against any foreign enemy without the assistance of the rest.

   Had the states severally been less able than they were when the war began,
   their united strength would not have been equal to the undertaking, and
   they must in all human probability have failed.- And, on the other hand,
   had they severally been more able, they might not have seen, or, what is
   more, might not have felt, the necessity of uniting: and, either by
   attempting to stand alone or in small confederacies, would have been
   separately conquered.

   Now, as we cannot see a time (and many years must pass away before it can
   arrive) when the strength of any one state, or several united, can be
   equal to the whole of the present United States, and as we have seen the
   extreme difficulty of collectively prosecuting the war to a successful
   issue, and preserving our national importance in the world, therefore,
   from the experience we have had, and the knowledge we have gained, we
   must, unless we make a waste of wisdom, be strongly impressed with the
   advantage, as well as the necessity of strengthening that happy union
   which had been our salvation, and without which we should have been a
   ruined people.

   While I was writing this note, I cast my eye on the pamphlet, Common
   Sense, from which I shall make an extract, as it exactly applies to the
   case. It is as follows:

   "I have never met with a man, either in England or America, who has not
   confessed it as his opinion that a separation between the countries would
   take place one time or other; and there is no instance in which we have
   shown less judgment, than in endeavoring to describe what we call the
   ripeness or fitness of the continent for independence.

   "As all men allow the measure, and differ only in their opinion of the
   time, let us, in order to remove mistakes, take a general survey of
   things, and endeavor, if possible, to find out the very time. But we need
   not to go far, the inquiry ceases at once, for, the time has found us. The
   general concurrence, the glorious union of all things prove the fact.

   "It is not in numbers, but in a union, that our great strength lies. The
   continent is just arrived at that pitch of strength, in which no single
   colony is able to support itself, and the whole, when united, can
   accomplish the matter; and either more or less than this, might be fatal
   in its effects." - Author
