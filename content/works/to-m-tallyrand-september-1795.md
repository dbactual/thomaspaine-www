   To M. Tallyrand  [September 1797]

   Rue theatre francais No. 4,

   CITIZEN MINISTER:

   I promised you some observations on the state of things between France and
   America. I divide the case into two parts. First, with respect to some
   method that shall effectually put an end to all interruptions of the
   American commerce. Secondly, with respect to settlement for the captures
   that have been made on that commerce.

   As to the first case (the interruptions of the American commerce by
   France) it has its foundation in the British Treaty, and it is the
   continuance of that treaty that renders the remedy difficult. Besides, the
   American administration has blundered so much in the business of treaty
   making that it is probable it will blunder again in making another with
   France. There is however one method left, and there is but one, that I can
   see, that will be effectual. It is a non-importation convention: that
   America agrees not to import from any nation in Europe who shall interrupt
   her commerce on the seas, any goods, wares, or merchandise whatever, and
   that all her ports shall be cut against the nation that gives offense.
   This will draw America out of her difficulties with respect to her treaty
   with England.

   But it would be far better if this non-importation were to be a general
   convention of nations acting as a whole. It would give better protection
   to neutral commerce than the armed neutrality could do. I would rather be
   a neutral nation under the protection of such a convention, which costs
   nothing to make it, than be under the protection of a navy equal to that
   of Britain. France should be the patron of such a convention and sign it.
   It would be giving both her consent and her protection to the Rights of
   neutral nations. If England refuse[s] to sign it, she will nevertheless be
   obliged to respect it or lose all her commerce.

   I enclose you a plan I drew up about four months ago when there was
   expectation that Mr. Madison would come to France. It has lain by me ever
   since.

   Of the second part, that of settlement for the captures, I will make the
   subject of a future correspondence.

   Salut et Respect

   THOMAS PAINE.
