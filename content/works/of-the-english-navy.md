   *Of the English Navy* &mdash;
   
   from the *American Citizen*, January 7, 1807.

   THE boasted navy of England has been the ruin of England. This may appear
   strange to a set of stupid feds, who have no more foresight than a mole
   under ground or they would not abuse France as they do; but strange as it
   may appear it is nevertheless true, and a little reflection on the case
   will shew it.

   The expence of that navy is greater than the nation can bear; and the
   deficiency is continually supplied by anticipation of revenue under the
   name of loans, till the national debt, which is the sum total of these
   anticipations, has amounted, according to the report of the chancellor of
   the exchequer to the English parliament the 28th of last March, to the
   enormous sum of 603,924,000 pounds sterling; and the interest of the debt at
   that time was 24,900,000 pounds sterling.

   What are called loans are no other than creating a new quantity of stock
   and sending it to market to be sold, and then laying on new taxes to pay
   the interest of that new stock. The persons called loaners, or subscribers
   for the loan, contract with the minister for large wholesale quantities of
   this new stock at as low a price as they can get it, and all they can make
   by retailing it is their profit. This ruinous system, for it is certain
   ruin in the end, began in the time of William the third, 118 years ago.

   The expence of the English navy this year, as given by the Chancellor of
   the Exchequer, last March, is 15,281,000 pounds sterling, above sixty eight
   million dollars. The enormous expence of this navy, taken on an average of
   peace and war, has run the nation into debt upwards of five millions sterling 
   every year for the 118 years since the
   system of what are called loans began. And it is this annual accumulation
   of more than five millions sterling every year for 118 years, that has 
   carried the English national debt to this
   enormous sum of 603,924,000 pounds sterling, which was the amount of the debt,
   in March last. 
   
   If it be asked, what has this mighty navy done to balance
   this expence? it may be answered, that comparatively speaking it has
   done nothing. It has obtained some victories at sea where nothing was to
   be gained but blows and broken bones, and it has plundered the unarmed
   vessels of neutral nations, and this makes the short history of its
   services.

   That the English government does not depend upon the navy to prevent
   Bonaparte making a descent upon England is demonstrated by the expensive
   preparations that government puts itself to by land to repel it. And that
   the navy contributes nothing to the protection of commerce is proved by
   the fact that all the ports on the continent of Europe are shut by land
   against the commerce of England. Of what use then is the navy that has
   incurred such an enormous debt, and which costs more than sixty eight
   millions of dollars annually to keep it up, which is three times more than
   all the gold and silver that the mines of Peru and Mexico annually
   produce. Such a navy will always keep a nation poor. No wonder then that
   every seventh person in England is a pauper, which is the fact. &mdash; The number
   of paupers now is 1,200,000.

   Another evil to England attending this navy, besides the debt it has
   incurred, is that it drains the nation of specie. More than half the
   materials that go into the construction of a navy in England are procured
   from Russia and Sweden; and as the exports of English manufactures to
   those places are but small the balance must be paid in specie. If
   Bonaparte succeed in all his plans I hope he will put an end to navies
   for the good of the world.

   COMMON SENSE.
