   Crisis IV



   Foner's introduction:

   The fourth number of the Crisis was written on the day following the
   Battle of Brandy wine, September 11, 1777. The British won the battle but
   at a considerable price losing many more men than the Americans. When the
   news reached Philadelphia that the American army had retreated to Chester,
   people began to flee from the city and Congress itself left for Lancaster.
   Paine was convinced that "unless something was done the City
   [Philadelphia] would be lost." (Letter to Benjamin Franklin, May 16,
   1778.) To arouse the citizens to a sense of their duty, and to stimulate
   Washington's weary and ill-clad soldiers, he penned the Crisis IV. Howe,
   Paine assured the fighting men, was weaker than before the battle, and the
   Americans could not lose, "unless we sit down and suffer them to do it."
   He ends his paper with one of his most famous utterances: "We fight not to
   enslave, but to set a country free, and to make room upon the earth for
   honest men to live in."

   **********

   THOSE who expect to reap the blessings of freedom, must, like men, undergo
   the fatigues of supporting it. The event of yesterday was one of those
   kind of alarms which is just sufficient to rouse us to duty, without being
   of consequence enough to depress our fortitude. It is not a field of a few
   acres of ground, but a cause, that we are defending, and whether we defeat
   the enemy in one battle, or by degrees, the consequences will be the same.

   Look back at the events of last winter and the present year, there you
   will find that the enemy's successes always contributed to reduce them.
   What they have gained in ground, they paid so dearly for in numbers, that
   their victories have in the end amounted to defeats. We have always been
   masters at the last push, and always shall be while we do our duty. Howe
   has been once on the banks of the Delaware, and from thence driven back
   with loss and disgrace: and why not be again driven from the Schuylkill?
   His condition and ours are very different. He has everybody to fight, we
   have only his one army to cope with, and which wastes away at every
   engagement: we can not only reinforce, but can redouble our numbers; he is
   cut off from all supplies, and must sooner or later inevitably fall into
   our hands.

   Shall a band of ten or twelve thousand robbers, who are this day fifteen
   hundred or two thousand men less in strength than they were yesterday,
   conquer America, or subdue even a single state? The thing cannot be,
   unless we sit down and suffer them to do it. Another such a brush,
   notwithstanding we lost the ground, would, by still reducing the enemy,
   put them in a condition to be afterwards totally defeated. Could our whole
   army have come up to the attack at one time, the consequences had probably
   been otherwise; but our having different parts of the Brandywine creek to
   guard, and the uncertainty which road to Philadelphia the enemy would
   attempt to take, naturally afforded them an opportunity of passing with
   their main body at a place where only a part of ours could be posted; for
   it must strike every thinking man with conviction, that it requires a much
   greater force to oppose an enemy in several places, than is sufficient to
   defeat him in any one place.

   Men who are sincere in defending their freedom, will always feel concern
   at every circumstance which seems to make against them; it is the natural
   and honest consequence of all affectionate attachments, and the want of it
   is a vice. But the dejection lasts only for a moment; they soon rise out
   of it with additional vigor; the glow of hope, courage and fortitude,
   will, in a little time, supply the place of every inferior passion, and
   kindle the whole heart into heroism.

   There is a mystery in the countenance of some causes, which we have not
   always present judgment enough to explain. It is distressing to see an
   enemy advancing into a country, but it is the only place in which we can
   beat them, and in which we have always beaten them, whenever they made the
   attempt. The nearer any disease approaches to a crisis, the nearer it is
   to a cure. Danger and deliverance make their advances together, and it is
   only the last push, in which one or the other takes the lead.

   There are many men who will do their duty when it is not wanted; but a
   genuine public spirit always appears most when there is most occasion for
   it. Thank God! our army, though fatigued, is yet entire. The attack made
   by us yesterday, was under many disadvantages, naturally arising from the
   uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy would take; and, from that
   circumstance, the whole of our force could not be brought up together time
   enough to engage all at once. Our strength is yet reserved; and it is
   evident that Howe does not think himself a gainer by the affair, otherwise
   he would this morning have moved down and attacked General Washington.

   Gentlemen of the city and country, it is in your power, by a spirited
   improvement of the present circumstance, to turn it to a real advantage.
   Howe is now weaker than before, and every shot will contribute to reduce
   him. You are more immediately interested than any other part of the
   continent: your all is at stake; it is not so with the general cause; you
   are devoted by the enemy to plunder and destruction: it is the
   encouragement which Howe, the chief of plunderers, has promised his army.
   Thus circumstanced, you may save yourselves by a manly resistance, but you
   can have no hope in any other conduct. I never yet knew our brave general,
   or any part of the army, officers or men, out of heart, and I have seen
   them in circumstances a thousand times more trying than the present. It is
   only those that are not in action, that feel languor and heaviness, and
   the best way to rub it off is to turn out, and make sure work of it.

   Our army must undoubtedly feel fatigue, and want a reinforcement of rest
   though not of valor. Our own interest and happiness call upon us to give
   them every support in our power, and make the burden of the day, on which
   the safety of this city depends, as light as possible. Remember,
   gentlemen, that we have forces both to the northward and southward of
   Philadelphia, and if the enemy be but stopped till those can arrive, this
   city will be saved, and the enemy finally routed. You have too much at
   stake to hesitate. You ought not to think an hour upon the matter, but to
   spring to action at once. Other states have been invaded, have likewise
   driven off the invaders. Now our time and turn is come, and perhaps the
   finishing stroke is reserved for us. When we look back on the dangers we
   have been saved from, and reflect on the success we have been blessed
   with, it would be sinful either to be idle or to despair.

   I close this paper with a short address to General Howe. You, sir, are
   only lingering out the period that shall bring with it your defeat. You
   have yet scarce began upon the war, and the further you enter, the faster
   will your troubles thicken. What you now enjoy is only a respite from
   ruin; an invitation to destruction; something that will lead on to our
   deliverance at your expense. We know the cause which we are engaged in,
   and though a passionate fondness for it may make us grieve at every injury
   which threatens it, yet, when the moment of concern is over, the
   determination to duty returns. We are not moved by the gloomy smile of a
   worthless king, but by the ardent glow of generous patriotism. We fight
   not to enslave, but to set a country free, and to make room upon the earth
   for honest men to live in. In such a case we are sure that we are right;
   and we leave to you the despairing reflection of being the tool of a
   miserable tyrant.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 12, 1777.
