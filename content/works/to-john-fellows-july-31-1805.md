   To John Fellows  July 31, 1805

   N[ EW ] ROCHELLE,

   CITIZEN :

   I received yours of the 26 Inst. in answer to mine of the 19th. I see that
   Cheetham has left out the part respecting Hamilton and Mrs. Reynolds but
   for my own part I wish it had been in. Had the story never been publicly
   told I would not have been the first to tell it; but Hamilton has told it
   himself and therefore it was no secret. But my motive in introducing it
   was because it was applicable to the subject I was upon, and to show the
   revilers of Mr. Jefferson that while they are affecting a morality of
   horror at an unproved and unfounded story about Mr. Jefferson they had
   better look at home, and give vent to the horror, if they had any at a
   real case of their own Dragon and his Delilah of a thousand dollars. It
   was not introduced to expose Hamilton for Hamilton had exposed himself,
   and that from a bad motive, a disregard of private character. "I do not
   (said Hamilton to Mrs. Harris), "I do not care a damn about my private
   character. It is my public character only that I care about." The man who
   is a good public character from craft, and not from moral principle, if
   such a character can be called good, is not much to be depended on.
   Cheetham might as well have put the part in, as put in the reasons for
   which he left it out. Those reasons leave people at liberty to suspect
   that the part suppressed related to some new discovered criminality in
   Hamilton, worse than the old story.

   I am glad that Palmer and Foster have got together. It will greatly help
   the cause on. I enclose a letter I received a few days since from Groton
   in Connecticut. The letter is well written and with a good deal of sincere
   enthusiasm. The publication of it would do good but there is an
   impropriety in publishing a man's name to a private letter. You may show
   the letter to Palmer and Foster. It is very likely they may know the
   writer, as Groton is about five or six miles from Tonington where Mr.
   Foster lived, and where, I believe, Mr. Palmer has some relations. As
   there is not an expression in the letter that renders it unfit for
   publication provided the name be omitted, or the initials J C be put in
   the room of it, I, for one, agree to the publication of it. It will serve
   to give confidence to those who are not strong enough in the true faith to
   throw off the mask of hypocrisy, as is the case in Connecticut, and there
   is no one vice that is more destructive to morals than this yanky-town
   vice, hypocrisy, is. If the concluding paragraph be omitted, and the
   address at the top be in the plain style as I have put it, it will lose
   the appearance of a private letter. I have put out the word Sir in three
   or four places. Cheetham can have no reasonable objection against
   publishing it. It is a letter without offence, and he has some atonement
   to make for what was in his paper the winter before last, about the
   "mischievous writings of Thomas Paine." If you give the letter to
   Cheetham, I wish him to return it to you after he has used it, or you to
   call for it.

   I am glad you have seen Mr. Barrett; but it is very extraordinary that you
   had not seen him before, for certainly a man in business is always to be
   found though he may not be always at home the first time. Your former
   letter might have been interpreted to signify that he kept out of sight,
   for you had called at least a dozen times.

   It is certainly best that Mrs. Bonneville go into some family, as a
   teacher, for she has not the least talent of managing affairs for herself.
   She may send Bebee up to me. I will take care of him for his own sake and
   his fathers, but this is all I have to say.

   Remember me to my much respected friend Carver and tell him I am sure we
   shall succeed if we hold on. We have already silenced the clamor of the
   priests. They act now as if they would say, let us alone and we will let
   alone. You do not tell me if the Prospect goes on. As Carver will want hay
   he may have it of me, and pay when it suits him, but I expect he will take
   a ride up some Saturday afternoon and then he can choose for himself.

   I am master of an empty house or nearly so. I have six chairs and a table,
   a straw-bed, a feather-bed and a bag of straw for Thomas, a tea kettle, an
   iron pot, an iron baking pan, a frying pan, a gridiron, cups, saucers,
   plates and dishes, knives and forks, two candlesticks and a pair of
   snuffers. I have a pair of fine oxen and an ox-cart, a good horse, a
   chair, and a one-horse cart, a cow, and a sow and 9 pigs. When you come
   you must take such fare as you meet with, for I live upon tea, milk, fruit
   pies, plain dumplings, and a piece of meat when I get it. But I live with
   that retirement and quiet that suit me. Mrs. Bonneville was an encumbrance
   upon me all the while she was here, for she would not do anything, not
   even make an apple-dumpling for her own children. If you can make yourself
   up a straw bed, I can let you have blankets and you will have no occasion
   to go over to the tavern to sleep.

   As I do not see any federal papers, except by accident, I know not if they
   have attempted any remarks, or criticisms on my 8th letter, the piece on
   Constitutions, government and charters, the two numbers on Turner's
   letter, and also the piece to Hulbert. As to anonymous paragraphs it is
   not worth noticing them. I consider the generality of such editors only as
   a part of their press and let them pass.

   I want to come to Morrisan[i]a, and it is probable I may come on to N[ew]
   York, but I wish you to answer this letter first.

   Yours in friendship

   THOMAS PAINE.
