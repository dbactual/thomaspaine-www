   To Citizen Barras  December 29, 1797

   CITIZEN PRESIDENT:

   A very particular friend of mine, who had a passport to go to London upon
   some family affairs and to return in three months, and whom I had
   commissioned upon some affairs of my own (for I find that the English
   government has seized upon a thousand pounds sterling which I had in the
   hands of a friend), returned two days ago and gave me the memorandum which
   I enclose. The first part relates only to my publication on the event of
   the 18 Fructidor, and to a letter to Erskine  (who had been counsel for
   the prosecution against a former work of mine the Age of Reason) both of
   which I desired my friend to publish in London. The other part of the
   memorandum respects the state of affairs in that country, by which I see
   they have little or no idea of a descent being made upon them; tant
   mieux-but they will be guarded in Ireland, as they expect a descent there.

   I expect a printed copy of the letter to Erskine in a day or two. As this
   is in English, and on a subject that will be amusing to Citizen Revel-Here
   Le Peaux, I will send it to him. The friend of whom I speak was a pupil of
   Dessault the surgeon, and whom I once introduced to you at a public
   audience in company with Captain Cooper on his plan respecting the Island
   of Bermuda.

   Salut et Respect.

   THOMAS PAINE.
