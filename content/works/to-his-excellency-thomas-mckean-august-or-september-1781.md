   To his Excellency Thomas McKean  [August or September, 1781]

   PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS

   Thursday Morning.

   SECOND STREET,

   SIR:

   It was my intention to have waited on you this morning, but a circumstance
   having prevented me, I take the liberty of troubling you with a thought or
   two on the reports of yesterday.

   As I see no practicable military object for Clinton to attempt, I think
   his march this way is probable. It was suggested to me last night by a
   gentleman that Clinton may have in view to ransom Cornwallis by
   threatening to burn Philadelphia. But taking it for granted that
   Cornwallis is a certain object, it may be as properly declared on our part
   that he and his garrison shall be put to the sword if any further burning
   or depredation is committed on the inhabitants.

   I think Clinton will not attempt the river, [but] probably take the
   nearest route cross the Jersies. And considering that his operations will
   be only exclusive, and to return as soon as possible, he will be more
   apprehensive of a force collected in his rear than in his front, and the
   garrison at Pecks kiln or West Point should move the instant he moves
   could it be possible; for those posts will scarcely require defence,
   because there will then be no force to act against them, and they may be
   garrisoned by militia.

   As the force against Cornwallis is quite sufficient, and as the French
   fleet cannot contribute to his reduction, they would render double service
   by being off the Hook; for supposing the British fleet at sea, they have
   no transport to bring off Cornwallis. Neither would they in my opinion
   venture up a river, while a superior fleet was at sea and might shut them
   in. But supposing them (the British) at the Hook, the French fleet by
   being stationed off, would overcome all the intended operations of
   Clinton, and eventually deprive Cornwallis of assistance and at the same
   time secure all this part of the Country by confining Clinton to defensive
   measures.

   I am Sir your obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. If there is any occasion to send information to the Army, further
   than what a common Express is sufficient to transact, Congress are welcome
   to my services.
