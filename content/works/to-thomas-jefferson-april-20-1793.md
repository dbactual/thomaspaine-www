   To Thomas Jefferson  April 20, 1793

   PARIS,

   MY DEAR FRIEND:

   The gentleman (Dr. Romer) to whom I entrust this letter is an intimate
   acquaintance of Lavater; but I have not had the opportunity of seeing him,
   as he had set off for Havre prior to my writing this letter, which I
   forward to him under cover from one of his friends, who is also an
   acquaintance of mine.

   We are now in an extraordinary crisis, and it is not altogether without
   some considerable faults here. Dumouriez, partly from having no fixed
   principles of his own, and partly from the continual persecution of the
   Jacobins, who act without either prudence or morality, has gone off to the
   enemy, and taken a considerable part of the army with him. The expedition
   to Holland has totally failed and all Brabant is again in the hands of the
   Austrians.

   You may suppose the consternation which such a sudden reverse of fortune
   has occasioned, but it has been without commotion. Dumouriez threatened to
   be in Paris in three weeks. It is now three weeks ago; he is still on the
   frontier near to Mons with the enemy, who do not make any progress.
   Dumouriez has proposed to re-establish the former Constitution, in which
   plan the Austrians act with him. But if France and the National Convention
   act prudently this project will not succeed. In the first place there is a
   popular disposition against it, and there is force sufficient to prevent
   it. In the next place, a great deal is to be taken into the calculation
   with respect to the enemy. There are now so many powers accidentally
   jumbled together as to render it exceedingly difficult to them to agree
   upon any common object.

   The first object, that of restoring the old monarchy, is evidently given
   up by the proposal to re-establish the late Constitution. The object of
   England and Prussia was to preserve Holland, and the object of Austria was
   to recover Brabant; while those separate objects lasted, each party having
   one, the Confederation could hold together, each helping the other; but
   after this I see not how a common object is to be formed. To all this is
   to be added the probable disputes about opportunity, the expense, and the
   projects of reimbursements. The enemy has once adventured into France, and
   they had the permission or the good fortune to get back again. On every
   military calculation it is a hazardous adventure, and armies are not much
   disposed to try a second time the ground upon which they have been
   defeated.

   Had this Revolution been conducted consistently with its principles, there
   was once a good prospect of extending liberty through the greatest part of
   Europe; but I now relinquish that hope. Should the enemy by venturing into
   France put themselves again in a condition of being captured, the hope
   will revive; but this is a risk that I do not wish to see tried, lest it
   should fail.

   As the prospect of a general freedom is now much shortened, I begin to
   contemplate returning home. I shall await the event of the proposed
   Constitution, and then take my final leave of Europe. I have not written
   to the President, as I have nothing to communicate more than in this
   letter. Please to present to him my affection and compliments, and
   remember me among the circle of my friends. Your sincere and affectionate
   friend,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   P. S. I just now received a letter from General Lewis Morris, who tells me
   that the house and barn on my farm at N. Rochelle are burnt down. I assure
   you I shall not bring money enough to build another.
