Title: Remarks on English Affairs
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:52 EDT 2014

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This interesting article on English affairs appeared in the Baltimore
   Evening Post of July 8, 1805, and has never before been reprinted or even
   mentioned in any discussion of Paine's writings. It was preceded by an
   introductory comment by the editor of the Post which went: "The following
   excellent remarks upon English affairs, though the first we have received
   from our friend, we trust will not be the last. We feel highly gratified
   in having an opportunity to adorn our pages with an original from his pen,
   and beg that the Evening Post may be occasionally privileged with his
   lucubrations."

   For concrete evidence that Paine wrote this article, see his letter to
   John Fellows, July 9, 1805.

   THE imaginary importance of the government of England, draws to a close.
   In the two last wars, that with America, and the other with France, she
   was defeated and disgraced in all her projects; and the present war, as
   far as it has gone, gives symptoms of a similar fate. There is evidently a
   madness in her councils (besides the royal madness) that has no foresight,
   and cannot calculate events.

   One would suppose, that when a government goes to war of its own choice,
   and is the first to declare it (which was the case with the English
   government in the present war with France), that it had arranged all its
   plans, and had everything in readiness to put these plans in operation the
   instant it declared war. But this was not the case with the English
   government; for as it has put no plan in execution, the inference is, that
   either it had none, or those it had were too imperfectly formed to be
   executed. Take which of the inferences you will, and it shows the
   incompetency of the English government to the condition into which it has
   plunged itself.

   It was laughable enough to see how the British parliament passed away its
   time in debating whether there was cause for war or not when they declared
   it. A ministerial victory in parliament does not decide a battle in the
   field. Philosophers and naturalists have to do with causes, and
   politicians with consequences. For example, it would have been madness in
   America to have declared independence, if she had not possessed the means
   of obtaining it, and the same may be said of every hostile declaration.

   As far as inferences can be drawn from circumstances, the British
   government went to war from internal craft, and not from external policy.
   After the publication in England of a small work of Thomas Paine in the
   year '96, entitled Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance,
   there was so great a run upon the Bank of England, that the bank could not
   stand it. The directors of the bank made their condition known to Mr.
   Pitt, who undoubtedly knew it before, but farce was become necessary.
   Pitt, in order to ward off the blow that threatened destruction to the
   bank, and also to the government, brought a bill into parliament to
   restrain the bank (for that was the term used) from paying its notes in
   specie; whereas the case with the bank was, that it could not pay-it had
   not wherewithal. This act, at first was only for a few months, but it was
   afterwards renewed, and continued to be renewed in every session from year
   to year. By the last renewal, the restraint (as it was called) was to
   continue till some time after the end of the war then going on. But when
   that time came, the bank could not pay any more than it could before; and
   therefore the government, after it had made peace, declared war again, and
   this was made a pretence for again shutting up the bank. That bank will
   never open for payment. Its ruin is as fixed as fate.

   The same farce about cause instead of consequence was again acted with
   respect to the declaration of war against Spain. Pitt made a long and
   wordy speech of three hours, to show, in his way, there was cause of war,
   whereas it was the consequence only that should have governed him.

   In a treaty between France and Spain, when the last war ended, it was
   stipulated that in case either should be attacked, the other should, as an
   auxiliary, assist her with a certain number of ships and land forces. This
   was commuted for in money, and, instead of ships and forces, France agreed
   to take three millions sterling annually. The case therefore with Pitt
   ought to have been, not any thing about the cause, but about the
   consequence; that is, whether it was not better to let Spain fulfill her
   engagement in this manner quietly by commutation, than to force her, by a
   declaration of war, to join France with her whole force by sea and land.
   It is Bonaparte that is the gainer by this conduct of Pitt, who, by thus
   increasing the force of his enemy, has made that of England comparatively
   less.

   When the family of the Bourbons reigned in France, the natural powers and
   resources of that country, which are greater than those of any country in
   the world, were never effectually called forth. Voluptuousness,
   effeminancy and intrigue were then the deities of the court, and the
   nation was governed by mistresses and the favorites of mistresses. The
   case now is the reverse of what it was then. France, at this time, has for
   its chief the most enterprizing man in Europe, and the greatest general in
   the world; and besides these virtues or vices (call them what you please,
   for they may be either), he is a deep and consummate politician in every
   thing which relates to the success of his measures. He knows both how to
   plan and how to execute. This is a talent that Pitt is defective in, for
   all his measures fail in execution. His forte lies in making long
   speeches, and in planning intrigues that evaporate in disappointment and
   disgrace.

   England, at this time, is in the most critical situation she ever was put
   in by France, and there is no foreseeing when or how it is to end.
   According to appearances, France may hold England in constant alarm and
   insupportable expence as long as she pleases, and that without any new
   expence or suffering any alarms herself; and by drawing off the English
   fleet from the defence of its coast at home, by sending her own on distant
   expeditions, she encreases the chance of a descent by gunboats. France
   could not do this till Pitt, by his ill policy, joined the navy of Spain
   to France.

   The discovery that has been made of the embezzlement of money in the
   treasury by Dundas alias Lord Melville, will go a great way towards
   breaking up the present ministry. That Pitt was privy to this
   embezzlement, there can scarcely be a doubt; for as he held the offices of
   first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer, and was, in
   consequence thereof, the person who brings in the budget, that is, the
   annual statement of expences, he cannot be supposed to be ignorant of it,
   and if he was, it shows he kept a bad look out, and is not fit for the
   office of treasurer and chancellor. The answer also of their king,
   involves suspicion. It implies a knowledge of the transaction, for it
   says, that, "notwithstanding the clamor that had been raised against that
   nobleman (Melville), he trusted his faithful commons would soon see reason
   to express an opinion that his lordship had acquitted himself with the
   utmost anxiety for the welfare and salvation of the British empire." But
   neither his faithful commons as he calls them, nor his loyal subjects, as
   he sometimes calls the people, appear to believe a word of what he says,
   for they are pushing the matter still further on. Melville was first lord
   of the admiralty, and treasurer of the navy; and had the official
   direction of naval expeditions. The ill news from the West-Indies, would
   arrive in England about the time of the discovery of this embezzlement,
   and will in their consequences affect the whole of the present ministry.
