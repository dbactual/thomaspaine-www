   To Mr Claypoole (Pennsylvania Packet)  January, 1786

   I send you a head piece with my name to it to be prefaced to the piece I
   send you for publication. You told me that those pieces were contrary to
   your opinion, but as your opinion is perhaps contrary to that of the
   majority of the people of this city and of the State, and to a very great
   number who take your paper, you must see the impropriety of setting your
   own opinion up, as a Judge in the first instance of what shall be
   suppressed. If the freedom of the press, is to be determined by the
   judgment of the printer of a Newspaper in preference to that of the
   people, who when they read will judge for themselves, the freedom is on a
   very sandy foundation. If you do not choose to publish the piece tomorrow
   you will please return it to me, and I will publish it in a handbill with
   any reason you shall assign for that refusal or without it as you choose.
