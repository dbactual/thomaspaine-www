   From the original letter at the American Philosophical Society.
   
   Mr. Claypoole
   
   I send you a head piece with my name to it to be prefaced to the piece I
   send you for publication. 
   
   You told me that those pieces were contrary to
   your opinion &mdash; but as your opinion is perhaps contrary to that of the
   majority of the people of this City & of the State and to a very great
   number who take your paper you must see the impropriety of setting your
   own opinion up, as a Judge in the first instance of what shall be
   suppressed. &mdash; If the freedom of the press, is to be determined by the
   Judgment of the printer of a News paper, in preference to that of the
   people, who when they read will judge for themselves, the freedom is on a
   very sandy foundation. If you do not chuse to publish the piece tomorrow
   you will please return it to me, and I will publish it in a handbill with
   any reason you shall assign for that refusal or without it as you chuse.

   I am Sir your Humble servt
   
   Thomas Paine
   
   If you publish it you will please to send me a proof as soon as you 
   can in the afternoon, as there are two or three words which on account 
   of you not publishing it this morning must be altered
   
   TP &mdash;
   
   As no other paper comes out before Wednesday and as it is necessary 
   the piece should appear tomorrow &mdash; the public cannot have 
   an opportunity of seeing the piece tomorrow thro any other public 
   paper than yours &mdash;
