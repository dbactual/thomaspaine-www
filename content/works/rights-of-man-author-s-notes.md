   The Author's Notes

   FOR PART ONE AND PART TWO

   1. The main and uniform maxim of the judges is, the greater the truth the
   greater the libel.

   2. Since writing the above, two other places occur in Mr. Burke's pamphlet
   in which the name of the Bastille is mentioned, but in the same manner. In
   the one he introduces it in a sort of obscure question, and asks: "Will
   any ministers who now serve such a king, with but a decent appearance of
   respect, cordially obey the orders of those whom but the other day, in his
   name, they had committed to the Bastille?" In the other the taking it is
   mentioned as implying criminality in the French guards, who assisted in
   demolishing it. "They have not," says he, "forgot the taking the king's
   castles at Paris." This is Mr. Burke, who pretends to write on
   constitutional freedom.

   3. I am warranted in asserting this, as I had it personally from M. de la
   Fayette, with whom I lived in habits of friendship for fourteen years.

   4. An account of the expedition to Versailles may be seen in No. 13 of the
   Revolution de Paris containing the events from the 3rd to the 10th of
   October, 1789.

   5. It is a practice in some parts of the country, when two travellers have
   but one horse, which, like the national purse, will not carry double, that
   the one mounts and rides two or three miles ahead, and then ties the horse
   to a gate and walks on. When the second traveller arrives he takes the
   horse, rides on, and passes his companion a mile or two, and ties again,
   and so on- Ride and tie.

   6. The word he used was renvoye, dismissed or sent away.

   7. When in any country we see extraordinary circumstances taking place,
   they naturally lead any man who has a talent for observation and
   investigation, to enquire into the causes. The manufacturers of
   Manchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield, are the principal manufacturers in
   England. From whence did this arise? A little observation will explain the
   case. The principal, and the generality of the inhabitants of those
   places, are not of what is called in England, the church established by
   law: and they, or their fathers, (for it is within but a few years)
   withdrew from the persecution of the chartered towns, where test-laws more
   particularly operate, and established a sort of asylum for themselves in
   those places. It was the only asylum that then offered, for the rest of
   Europe was worse.- But the case is now changing. France and America bid
   all comers welcome, and initiate them into all the rights of citizenship.
   Policy and interest, therefore, will, but perhaps too late, dictate in
   England, what reason and justice could not. Those manufacturers are
   withdrawing, and arising in other places. There is now erecting in Passey,
   three miles from Paris, a large cotton manufactory, and several are
   already erected in America. Soon after the rejecting the Bill for
   repealing the test-law, one of the richest manufacturers in England said
   in my hearing, "England, Sir, is not a country for a dissenter to live
   in,- we must go to France." These are truths, and it is doing justice to
   both parties to tell them. It is chiefly the dissenters that have carried
   English manufactures to the height they are now at, and the same men have
   it in their power to carry them away; and though those manufactures would
   afterwards continue in those places, the foreign market will be lost.
   There frequently appear in the London Gazette, extracts from certain acts
   to prevent machines and persons, as far as they can extend to persons,
   from going out of the country. It appears from these that the ill effects
   of the test-laws and church-establishment begin to be much suspected; but
   the remedy of force can never supply the remedy of reason. In the progress
   of less than a century, all the unrepresented part of England, of all
   denominations, which is at least an hundred times the most numerous, may
   begin to feel the necessity of a constitution, and then all those matters
   will come regularly before them.

   8. When the English Minister, Mr. Pitt, mentions the French finances again
   in the English Parliament, it would be well that he noticed this as an
   example.

   9. Mr. Burke, (and I must take the liberty of telling him that he is very
   unacquainted with French affairs), speaking upon this subject, says, "The
   first thing that struck me in calling the States-General, was a great
   departure from the ancient course";- and he soon after says, "From the
   moment I read the list, I saw distinctly, and very nearly as it has
   happened, all that was to follow."- Mr. Burke certainly did not see an
   that was to follow. I endeavoured to impress him, as well before as after
   the States-General met, that there would be a revolution; but was not able
   to make him see it, neither would he believe it. How then he could
   distinctly see all the parts, when the whole was out of sight, is beyond
   my comprehension. And with respect to the "departure from the ancient
   course," besides the natural weakness of the remark, it shows that he is
   unacquainted with circumstances. The departure was necessary, from the
   experience had upon it, that the ancient course was a bad one. The
   States-General of 1614 were called at the commencement of the civil war in
   the minority of Louis XIII.; but by the class of arranging them by orders,
   they increased the confusion they were called to compose. The author of
   L'Intrigue du Cabinet, (Intrigue of the Cabinet), who wrote before any
   revolution was thought of in France, speaking of the States-General of
   1614, says, "They held the public in suspense five months; and by the
   questions agitated therein, and the heat with which they were put, it
   appears that the great (les grands) thought more to satisfy their
   particular passions, than to procure the goods of the nation; and the
   whole time passed away in altercations, ceremonies and parade."-
   L'Intrigue du Cabinet, vol. i. p. 329.

   10. There is a single idea, which, if it strikes rightly upon the mind,
   either in a legal or a religious sense, will prevent any man or any body
   of men, or any government, from going wrong on the subject of religion;
   which is, that before any human institutions of government were known in
   the world, there existed, if I may so express it, a compact between God
   and man, from the beginning of time: and that as the relation and
   condition which man in his individual person stands in towards his Maker
   cannot be changed by any human laws or human authority, that religious
   devotion, which is a part of this compact, cannot so much as be made a
   subject of human laws; and that all laws must conform themselves to this
   prior existing compact, and not assume to make the compact conform to the
   laws, which, besides being human, are subsequent thereto. The first act of
   man, when he looked around and saw himself a creature which he did not
   make, and a world furnished for his reception, must have been devotion;
   and devotion must ever continue sacred to every individual man, as it
   appears, right to him; and governments do mischief by interfering.

   11. See this work, Part I starting at line number 254.- N.B. Since the
   taking of the Bastille, the occurrences have been published: but the
   matters recorded in this narrative, are prior to that period; and some of
   them, as may be easily seen, can be but very little known.

   12. See "Estimate of the Comparative Strength of Great Britain," by G.
   Chalmers.

   13. See "Administration of the Finances of France," vol. iii, by M.
   Neckar.

   15. Whether the English commerce does not bring in money, or whether the
   government sends it out after it is brought in, is a matter which the
   parties concerned can best explain; but that the deficiency exists, is not
   in the power of either to disprove. While Dr. Price, Mr. Eden, (now
   Auckland), Mr. Chalmers, and others, were debating whether the quantity of
   money in England was greater or less than at the Revolution, the
   circumstance was not adverted to, that since the Revolution, there cannot
   have been less than four hundred millions sterling imported into Europe;
   and therefore the quantity in England ought at least to have been four
   times greater than it was at the Revolution, to be on a proportion with
   Europe. What England is now doing by paper, is what she would have been
   able to do by solid money, if gold and silver had come into the nation in
   the proportion it ought, or had not been sent out; and she is endeavouring
   to restore by paper, the balance she has lost by money. It is certain,
   that the gold and silver which arrive annually in the register-ships to
   Spain and Portugal, do not remain in those countries. Taking the value
   half in gold and half in silver, it is about four hundred tons annually;
   and from the number of ships and galloons employed in the trade of
   bringing those metals from South-America to Portugal and Spain, the
   quantity sufficiently proves itself, without referring to the registers.

   In the situation England now is, it is impossible she can increase in
   money. High taxes not only lessen the property of the individuals, but
   they lessen also the money capital of the nation, by inducing smuggling,
   which can only be carried on by gold and silver. By the politics which the
   British Government have carried on with the Inland Powers of Germany and
   the Continent, it has made an enemy of all the Maritime Powers, and is
   therefore obliged to keep up a large navy; but though the navy is built in
   England, the naval stores must be purchased from abroad, and that from
   countries where the greatest part must be paid for in gold and silver.
   Some fallacious rumours have been set afloat in England to induce a belief
   in money, and, among others, that of the French refugees bringing great
   quantities. The idea is ridiculous. The general part of the money in
   France is silver; and it would take upwards of twenty of the largest broad
   wheel wagons, with ten horses each, to remove one million sterling of
   silver. Is it then to be supposed, that a few people fleeing on horse-back
   or in post-chaises, in a secret manner, and having the French Custom-House
   to pass, and the sea to cross, could bring even a sufficiency for their
   own expenses?

   When millions of money are spoken of, it should be recollected, that such
   sums can only accumulate in a country by slow degrees, and a long
   procession of time. The most frugal system that England could now adopt,
   would not recover in a century the balance she has lost in money since the
   commencement of the Hanover succession. She is seventy millions behind
   France, and she must be in some considerable proportion behind every
   country in Europe, because the returns of the English mint do not show an
   increase of money, while the registers of Lisbon and Cadiz show an
   European increase of between three and four hundred millions sterling.

   16. That part of America which is generally called New-England, including
   New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island, and Connecticut, is peopled
   chiefly by English descendants. In the state of New-York about half are
   Dutch, the rest English, Scotch, and Irish. In New-jersey, a mixture of
   English and Dutch, with some Scotch and Irish. In Pennsylvania about one
   third are English, another Germans, and the remainder Scotch and Irish,
   with some Swedes. The States to the southward have a greater proportion of
   English than the middle States, but in all of them there is a mixture; and
   besides those enumerated, there are a considerable number of French, and
   some few of all the European nations, lying on the coast. The most
   numerous religious denomination are the Presbyterians; but no one sect is
   established above another, and all men are equally citizens

   17. For a character of aristocracy, the reader is referred to Rights of
   Man, Part I., starting at line number 1457.

   18. The whole amount of the assessed taxes of France, for the present
   year, is three hundred millions of francs, which is twelve millions and a
   half sterling; and the incidental taxes are estimated at three millions,
   making in the whole fifteen millions and a half; which among twenty-four
   millions of people, is not quite thirteen shillings per head. France has
   lessened her taxes since the revolution, nearly nine millions sterling
   annually. Before the revolution, the city of Paris paid a duty of upwards
   of thirty per cent. on all articles brought into the city. This tax was
   collected at the city gates. It was taken off on the first of last May,
   and the gates taken down.

   19. What was called the livre rouge, or the red book, in France, was not
   exactly similar to the Court Calendar in England; but it sufficiently
   showed how a great part of the taxes was lavished.

   20. In England the improvements in agriculture, useful arts, manufactures,
   and commerce, have been made in opposition to the genius of its
   government, which is that of following precedents. It is from the
   enterprise and industry of the individuals, and their numerous
   associations, in which, tritely speaking, government is neither pillow nor
   bolster, that these improvements have proceeded. No man thought about
   government, or who was in, or who was out, when he was planning or
   executing those things; and all he had to hope, with respect to
   government, was, that it would let him alone. Three or four very silly
   ministerial newspapers are continually offending against the spirit of
   national improvement, by ascribing it to a minister. They may with as much
   truth ascribe this book to a minister.

   21. With respect to the two houses, of which the English parliament is
   composed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a
   legislature, to have no temper of its own. The minister, whoever he at any
   time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it sleeps obedience.

   But if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses, the difference
   will appear so great, as to show the inconsistency of placing power where
   there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it. Wretched as the state
   of representation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is
   called the house of Lords; and so little is this nick-named house
   regarded, that the people scarcely enquire at any time what it is doing.
   It appears also to be most under influence, and the furthest removed from
   the general interest of the nation. In the debate on engaging in the
   Russian and Turkish war, the majority in the house of peers in favor of it
   was upwards of ninety, when in the other house, which was more than double
   its numbers, the majority was sixty-three.

   The proceedings on Mr. Fox's bill, respecting the rights of juries, merits
   also to be noticed. The persons called the peers were not the objects of
   that bill. They are already in possession of more privileges than that
   bill gave to others. They are their own jury, and if any one of that house
   were prosecuted for a libel, he would not suffer, even upon conviction,
   for the first offense. Such inequality in laws ought not to exist in any
   country. The French constitution says, that the law is the same to every
   individual, whether to Protect or to punish. All are equal in its sight.

   22. As to the state of representation in England, it is too absurd to be
   reasoned upon. Almost all the represented parts are decreasing in
   population, and the unrepresented parts are increasing. A general
   convention of the nation is necessary to take the whole form of government
   into consideration.

   23. It is related that in the canton of Berne, in Switzerland, it has been
   customary, from time immemorial, to keep a bear at the public expense, and
   the people had been taught to believe that if they had not a bear they
   should all be undone. It happened some years ago that the bear, then in
   being, was taken sick, and died too suddenly to have his place immediately
   supplied with another. During this interregnum the people discovered that
   the corn grew, and the vintage flourished, and the sun and moon continued
   to rise and set, and everything went on the same as before, and taking
   courage from these circumstances, they resolved not to keep any more
   bears; for, said they, "a bear is a very voracious expensive animal, and
   we were obliged to pull out his claws, lest he should hurt the citizens."
   The story of the bear of Berne was related in some of the French
   newspapers, at the time of the flight of Louis XVI., and the application
   of it to monarchy could not be mistaken in France; but it seems that the
   aristocracy of Berne applied it to themselves, and have since prohibited
   the reading of French newspapers.

   24. It is scarcely possible to touch on any subject, that will not suggest
   an allusion to some corruption in governments. The simile of
   "fortifications," unfortunately involves with it a circumstance, which is
   directly in point with the matter above alluded to.

   Among the numerous instances of abuse which have been acted or protected
   by governments, ancient or modern, there is not a greater than that of
   quartering a man and his heirs upon the public, to be maintained at its
   expense.

   Humanity dictates a provision for the poor; but by what right, moral or
   political, does any government assume to say, that the person called the
   Duke of Richmond, shall be maintained by the public? Yet, if common report
   is true, not a beggar in London can purchase his wretched pittance of
   coal, without paying towards the civil list of the Duke of Richmond. Were
   the whole produce of this imposition but a shilling a year, the iniquitous
   principle would be still the same; but when it amounts, as it is said to
   do, to no less than twenty thousand pounds per annum, the enormity is too
   serious to be permitted to remain. This is one of the effects of monarchy
   and aristocracy.

   In stating this case I am led by no personal dislike. Though I think it
   mean in any man to live upon the public, the vice originates in the
   government; and so general is it become, that whether the parties are in
   the ministry or in the opposition, it makes no difference: they are sure
   of the guarantee of each other.

   25. In America the increase of commerce is greater in proportion than in
   England. It is, at this time, at least one half more than at any period
   prior to the revolution. The greatest number of vessels cleared out of the
   port of Philadelphia, before the commencement of the war, was between
   eight and nine hundred. In the year 1788, the number was upwards of twelve
   hundred. As the State of Pennsylvania is estimated at an eighth part of
   the United States in population, the whole number of vessels must now be
   nearly ten thousand.

   26. When I saw Mr. Pitt's mode of estimating the balance of trade, in one
   of his parliamentary speeches, he appeared to me to know nothing of the
   nature and interest of commerce; and no man has more wantonly tortured it
   than himself. During a period of peace it has been havocked with the
   calamities of war. Three times has it been thrown into stagnation, and the
   vessels unmanned by impressing, within less than four years of peace.

   27. Rev. William Knowle, master of the grammar school of Thetford, in
   Norfolk.

   28. Politics and self-interest have been so uniformly connected that the
   world, from being so often deceived, has a right to be suspicious of
   public characters, but with regard to myself I am perfectly easy on this
   head. I did not, at my first setting out in public life, nearly seventeen
   years ago, turn my thoughts to subjects of government from motives of
   interest, and my conduct from that moment to this proves the fact. I saw
   an opportunity in which I thought I could do some good, and I followed
   exactly what my heart dictated. I neither read books, nor studied other
   people's opinion. I thought for myself.

   The case was this:- During the suspension of the old governments in
   America, both prior to and at the breaking out of hostilities, I was
   struck with the order and decorum with which everything was conducted, and
   impressed with the idea that a little more than what society naturally
   performed was all the government that was necessary, and that monarchy and
   aristocracy were frauds and impositions upon mankind. On these principles
   I published the pamphlet Common Sense. The success it met with was beyond
   anything since the invention of printing. I gave the copyright to every
   state in the Union, and the demand ran to not less than one hundred
   thousand copies. I continued the subject in the same manner, under the
   title of The Crisis, till the complete establishment of the Revolution.

   After the declaration of independence Congress unanimously, and unknown to
   me, appointed me Secretary in the Foreign Department. This was agreeable
   to me, because it gave me the opportunity of seeing into the abilities of
   foreign courts, and their manner of doing business. But a misunderstanding
   arising between Congress and me, respecting one of their commissioners
   then in Europe, Mr. Silas Deane, I resigned the office, and declined at
   the same time the pecuniary offers made by the Ministers of France and
   Spain, M. Gerald and Don Juan Mirralles.

   I had by this time so completely gained the ear and confidence of America,
   and my own independence was become so visible, as to give me a range in
   political writing beyond, perhaps, what any man ever possessed in any
   country, and, what is more extraordinary, I held it undiminished to the
   end of the war, and enjoy it in the same manner to the present moment. As
   my object was not myself, I set out with the determination, and happily
   with the disposition, of not being moved by praise or censure, friendship
   or calumny, nor of being drawn from my purpose by any personal
   altercation, and the man who cannot do this is not fit for a public
   character.

   When the war ended I went from Philadelphia to Borden-Town, on the east
   bank of the Delaware, where I have a small place. Congress was at this
   time at Prince-Town, fifteen miles distant, and General Washington had
   taken his headquarters at Rocky Hill, within the neighbourhood of
   Congress, for the purpose of resigning up his commission (the object for
   which he accepted it being accomplished), and of retiring to private life.
   While he was on this business he wrote me the letter which I here subjoin:

   "Rocky-Hill, Sept. 10, 1783.

   "I have learned since I have been at this place that you are at
   Borden-Town. Whether for the sake of retirement or economy I know not. Be
   it for either, for both, or whatever it may, if you will come to this
   place, and partake with me, I shall be exceedingly happy to see you at it.

   "Your presence may remind Congress of your past services to this country,
   and if it is in my power to impress them, command my best exertions with
   freedom, as they will be rendered cheerfully by one who entertains a
   lively sense of the importance of your works, and who, with much pleasure,
   subscribes himself, Your sincere friend,

   G. WASHINGTON."

   During the war, in the latter end of the year 1780, I formed to myself a
   design of coming over to England, and communicated it to General Greene,
   who was then in Philadelphia on his route to the southward, General
   Washington being then at too great a distance to communicate with
   immediately. I was strongly impressed with the idea that if I could get
   over to England without being known, and only remain in safety till I
   could get out a publication, that I could open the eyes of the country
   with respect to the madness and stupidity of its Government. I saw that
   the parties in Parliament had pitted themselves as far as they could go,
   and could make no new impressions on each other. General Greene entered
   fully into my views, but the affair of Arnold and Andre happening just
   after, he changed his mind, under strong apprehensions for my safety,
   wrote very pressingly to me from Annapolis, in Maryland, to give up the
   design, which, with some reluctance, I did. Soon after this I accompanied
   Colonel Lawrens, son of Mr. Lawrens, who was then in the Tower, to France
   on business from Congress. We landed at L'Orient, and while I remained
   there, he being gone forward, a circumstance occurred that renewed my
   former design. An English packet from Falmouth to New York, with the
   Government dispatches on board, was brought into L'Orient. That a packet
   should be taken is no extraordinary thing, but that the dispatches should
   be taken with it will scarcely be credited, as they are always slung at
   the cabin window in a bag loaded with cannon-ball, and ready to be sunk at
   a moment. The fact, however, is as I have stated it, for the dispatches
   came into my hands, and I read them. The capture, as I was informed,
   succeeded by the following stratagem:- The captain of the "Madame"
   privateer, who spoke English, on coming up with the packet, passed himself
   for the captain of an English frigate, and invited the captain of the
   packet on board, which, when done, he sent some of his own hands back, and
   he secured the mail. But be the circumstance of the capture what it may, I
   speak with certainty as to the Government dispatches. They were sent up to
   Paris to Count Vergennes, and when Colonel Lawrens and myself returned to
   America we took the originals to Congress.

   By these dispatches I saw into the stupidity of the English Cabinet far
   more than I otherwise could have done, and I renewed my former design. But
   Colonel Lawrens was so unwilling to return alone, more especially as,
   among other matters, we had a charge of upwards of two hundred thousand
   pounds sterling in money, that I gave in to his wishes, and finally gave
   up my plan. But I am now certain that if I could have executed it that it
   would not have been altogether unsuccessful.

   29. It is difficult to account for the origin of charter and corporation
   towns, unless we suppose them to have arisen out of, or been connected
   with, some species of garrison service. The times in which they began
   justify this idea. The generality of those towns have been garrisons, and
   the corporations were charged with the care of the gates of the towns,
   when no military garrison was present. Their refusing or granting
   admission to strangers, which has produced the custom of giving, selling,
   and buying freedom, has more of the nature of garrison authority than
   civil government. Soldiers are free of all corporations throughout the
   nation, by the same propriety that every soldier is free of every
   garrison, and no other persons are. He can follow any employment, with the
   permission of his officers, in any corporation towns throughout the
   nation.

   30. See Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue. The land-tax in 1646
   was L2,473,499.

   31. Several of the court newspapers have of late made frequent mention of
   Wat Tyler. That his memory should be traduced by court sycophants and an
   those who live on the spoil of a public is not to be wondered at. He was,
   however, the means of checking the rage and injustice of taxation in his
   time, and the nation owed much to his valour. The history is concisely
   this:- In the time of Richard II. a poll tax was levied of one shilling
   per head upon every person in the nation of whatever estate or condition,
   on poor as well as rich, above the age of fifteen years. If any favour was
   shown in the law it was to the rich rather than to the poor, as no person
   could be charged more than twenty shillings for himself, family and
   servants, though ever so numerous; while all other families, under the
   number of twenty were charged per head. Poll taxes had always been odious,
   but this being also oppressive and unjust, it excited as it naturally
   must, universal detestation among the poor and middle classes. The person
   known by the name of Wat Tyler, whose proper name was Walter, and a tiler
   by trade, lived at Deptford. The gatherer of the poll tax, on coming to
   his house, demanded tax for one of his daughters, whom Tyler declared was
   under the age of fifteen. The tax-gatherer insisted on satisfying himself,
   and began an indecent examination of the girl, which, enraging the father,
   he struck him with a hammer that brought him to the ground, and was the
   cause of his death. This circumstance served to bring the discontent to an
   issue. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood espoused the cause of Tyler,
   who in a few days was joined, according to some histories, by upwards of
   fifty thousand men, and chosen their chief. With this force he marched to
   London, to demand an abolition of the tax and a redress of other
   grievances. The Court, finding itself in a forlorn condition, and, unable
   to make resistance, agreed, with Richard at its head, to hold a conference
   with Tyler in Smithfield, making many fair professions, courtier-like, of
   its dispositions to redress the oppressions. While Richard and Tyler were
   in conversation on these matters, each being on horseback, Walworth, then
   Mayor of London, and one of the creatures of the Court, watched an
   opportunity, and like a cowardly assassin, stabbed Tyler with a dagger,
   and two or three others falling upon him, he was instantly sacrificed.
   Tyler appears to have been an intrepid disinterested man with respect to
   himself. All his proposals made to Richard were on a more just and public
   ground than those which had been made to John by the Barons, and
   notwithstanding the sycophancy of historians and men like Mr. Burke, who
   seek to gloss over a base action of the Court by traducing Tyler, his fame
   will outlive their falsehood. If the Barons merited a monument to be
   erected at Runnymede, Tyler merited one in Smithfield.

   32. I happened to be in England at the celebration of the centenary of the
   Revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have always
   appeared to be detestable; the one seeking to destroy his uncle, and the
   other her father, to get possession of power themselves; yet, as the
   nation was disposed to think something of that event, I felt hurt at
   seeing it ascribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken
   it as a job and who, besides what he otherwise got, charged six hundred
   thousand pounds for the expense of the fleet that brought him from
   Holland. George the First acted the same close-fisted part as William had
   done, and bought the Duchy of Bremen with the money he got from England,
   two hundred and fifty thousand pounds over and above his pay as king, and
   having thus purchased it at the expense of England, added it to his
   Hanoverian dominions for his own private profit. In fact, every nation
   that does not govern itself is governed as a job. England has been the
   prey of jobs ever since the Revolution.

   33. Charles, like his predecessors and successors, finding that war was
   the harvest of governments, engaged in a war with the Dutch, the expense
   of which increased the annual expenditure to L1,800,000 as stated under
   the date of 1666; but the peace establishment was but L1,200,000.

   34. Poor-rates began about the time of Henry VIII., when the taxes began
   to increase, and they have increased as the taxes increased ever since.

   35. Reckoning the taxes by families, five to a family, each family pays on
   an average L12 7s. 6d. per annum. To this sum are to be added the
   poor-rates. Though all pay taxes in the articles they consume, all do not
   pay poor-rates. About two millions are exempted- some as not being
   house-keepers, others as not being able, and the poor themselves who
   receive the relief. The average, therefore, of poor-rates on the remaining
   number, is forty shillings for every family of five persons, which make
   the whole average amount of taxes and rates L14 17s. 6d. For six persons
   L17 17s. For seven persons L2O 16s. 6d.

   The average of taxes in America, under the new or representative system of
   government, including the interest of the debt contracted in the war, and
   taking the population at four millions of souls, which it now amounts to,
   and it is daily increasing, is five shillings per head, men, women, and
   children. The difference, therefore, between the two governments is as
   under:

   England America

   L s. d. L s. d.

   For a family of five persons 14 17 6 1 5 0

   For a family of six persons 17 17 0 1 10 0

   For a family of seven persons 20 16 6 1 15 0

   36. Public schools do not answer the general purpose of the poor. They are
   chiefly in corporation towns from which the country towns and villages are
   excluded, or, if admitted, the distance occasions a great loss of time.
   Education, to be useful to the poor, should be on the spot, and the best
   method, I believe, to accomplish this is to enable the parents to pay the
   expenses themselves. There are always persons of both sexes to be found in
   every village, especially when growing into years, capable of such an
   undertaking. Twenty children at ten shillings each (and that not more than
   six months each year) would be as much as some livings amount to in the
   remotest parts of England, and there are often distressed clergymen's
   widows to whom such an income would be acceptable. Whatever is given on
   this account to children answers two purposes. To them it is education- to
   those who educate them it is a livelihood.

   37. The tax on beer brewed for sale, from which the aristocracy are
   exempt, is almost one million more than the present commutation tax, being
   by the returns of 1788, L1,666,152- and, consequently, they ought to take
   on themselves the amount of the commutation tax, as they are already
   exempted from one which is almost a million greater.

   38. See the Reports on the Corn Trade.

   39. When enquiries are made into the condition of the poor, various
   degrees of distress will most probably be found, to render a different
   arrangement preferable to that which is already proposed. Widows with
   families will be in greater want than where there are husbands living.
   There is also a difference in the expense of living in different counties:
   and more so in fuel.

   Suppose then fifty thousand extraordinary cases, at the rate of ten pounds
   per family per annum L500,000
   100,000 families, at L8 per family per annum 800,000

   100,000 families, at L7 per family per annum 700,000

   104,000 families, at L5 per family per annum 520,000

   And instead of ten shillings per head for the education of other children,
   to allow fifty shillings per family for that purpose to fifty thousand
   families 250,000

   ----------

   L2,770,000

   140,000 aged persons as before 1,120,000

   ----------

   L3,890,000

   This arrangement amounts to the same sum as stated in this work, Part II,
   line number 1068, including the L250,000 for education; but it provides
   (including the aged people) for four hundred and four thousand families,
   which is almost one third of an the families in England.

   40. I know it is the opinion of many of the most enlightened characters in
   France (there always will be those who see further into events than
   others), not only among the general mass of citizens, but of many of the
   principal members of the former National Assembly, that the monarchical
   plan will not continue many years in that country. They have found out,
   that as wisdom cannot be made hereditary, power ought not; and that, for a
   man to merit a million sterling a year from a nation, he ought to have a
   mind capable of comprehending from an atom to a universe, which, if he
   had, he would be above receiving the pay. But they wished not to appear to
   lead the nation faster than its own reason and interest dictated. In all
   the conversations where I have been present upon this subject, the idea
   always was, that when such a time, from the general opinion of the nation,
   shall arrive, that the honourable and liberal method would be, to make a
   handsome present in fee simple to the person, whoever he may be, that
   shall then be in the monarchical office, and for him to retire to the
   enjoyment of private life, possessing his share of general rights and
   privileges, and to be no more accountable to the public for his time and
   his conduct than any other citizen.

   41. The gentleman who signed the address and declaration as chairman of
   the meeting, Mr. Horne Tooke, being generally supposed to be the person
   who drew it up, and having spoken much in commendation of it, has been
   jocularly accused of praising his own work. To free him from this
   embarrassment, and to save him the repeated trouble of mentioning the
   author, as he has not failed to do, I make no hesitation in saying, that
   as the opportunity of benefiting by the French Revolution easily occurred
   to me, I drew up the publication in question, and showed it to him and
   some other gentlemen, who, fully approving it, held a meeting for the
   purpose of making it public, and subscribed to the amount of fifty guineas
   to defray the expense of advertising. I believe there are at this time, in
   England, a greater number of men acting on disinterested principles, and
   determined to look into the nature and practices of government themselves,
   and not blindly trust, as has hitherto been the case, either to government
   generally, or to parliaments, or to parliamentary opposition, than at any
   former period. Had this been done a century ago, corruption and taxation
   had not arrived to the height they are now at.

   THE END
