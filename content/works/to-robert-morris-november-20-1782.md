   To Robert Morris  November 20, 1782

   Second Street, PHILADELPHIA,

   SIR:

   As I do not sit down with a design of making a fair copy of this letter,
   but only to communicate a few thoughts, you will, I hope, excuse what
   blotting or scratching there may be in the course of it.

   I have made a beginning on the citizens of R[hode] I[sland] which will
   appear in Bradford's and Claypoole's Sunday's papers, I intend to continue
   the subject to three Letters, as you will see by the conclusion of the
   first. The second will be on the convenience and equality of the Tax, and
   the third on the Union of the States. I shall not put the signature,
   Common Sense, to them, because I do not wish to bring them into more
   notice than there is occasion for. But I intend putting them under cover
   to the printers of the Providence paper, and that he may not grumble I
   shall pay the postage.

   All these embarrassments are ascribable to the loose and almost disjointed
   condition of the Union. The States severally not knowing what each will do
   are unwilling to do anything themselves. But the point to be considered
   now is, whether we cannot make the inconvenience a foundation for a
   reform, by applying the inconvenience as a reason for it.

   In our situation, as a republic, made up of many parts, there are matters
   Continental, others which are Statacal. The first, like the second, is
   easily conceived to divide itself into two parts, Executive and
   Legislative. Of the first kind (a Continental executive) is the right of
   war and peace, all foreign affairs, the direction of the Army and Navy
   when we have one, the ascertainment of expenses in the gross, and perhaps
   the quotoing them out in the several States. Of the second kind
   (Continental legislation) is the regulation of the Post Office, the
   regulation of Commerce and consequently of all taxes to be raised by
   commerce to, or from foreign parts, the right of making laws for treason
   against the United States, against forgery of Continental bills bonds or
   notes, and other matters (which are not many) in which all the States are
   interested alike and for which reason the law therefore must be alike in
   each.

   The people in all the States have conceived an im[pro]priety, or rather
    what they call an inconsistency an imblending the executive with the
   legislative (I observe the objection is thrown out by the Citizens of
   R[hode] Ifsland] in the Freeman's Journal of today) and I am apt to think
   that some of the embarrassments respecting the present duly arises from an
   idea, that Congress is pointing out the law itself, instead of calling for
   the sum only, slips into a legislative character.

   Now in all matters of this kind which must be alike in all the States, to
   secure any one from having an unfair advantage taken of her situation by
   another, were Congress in the form of a message and recommendation to lay
   the matter with the necessity, propriety and advantage before the several
   States and summon, once a year or occasionally a legislature of 3 or 5
   persons from each State, to meet and enact the law for and in behalf of
   the whole, and that to be the operating law for all. I think much of the
   difficulty would be got over and Congress stand in a much better and more
   exalted situation than at present, because being obliged now to act in
   cases where it is conceived they have not a delegated right, and subjects
   their whole authority to suspicious observation; and consequently to take
   from them the occasion of acting out of character, will establish their
   acting in character.

   As the people of America do not feel themselves legislatively connected,
   and are not willing that Congress should supply it, they feel a link
   wanting in the chain of union which something like what I have mentioned
   might complete, because I would have all these sort of laws ceremoniously
   passed by a legislature summoned for the purpose. It would remove the
   present little and prevailing suspicion of the Executive powers.

   But my immediate view in suggesting these thoughts to you is to find a way
   to carry us over the present difficulty with R[hode] I[sland]. I see a
   train of evils attending a rupture, and many inconveniences following from
   his present conduct.

   But if you think these hints worthy of some attention, and should find on
   conversing with others, that they are of the same opinion, might it not be
   suggested to Rhode Island that it is in contemplation to recommend to the
   State to depute a number from their bodies for the express purpose of
   deliberating upon, and framing such a law as shall operate with equal
   justice over all, inferring at the same time the necessity of her
   cordially going hand and hand with the States as far as they have already
   gone, and refer herself in common with the rest to a legislative decision
   of the whole.

   My third Number will be particularly calculated to ENJOIN THE NECESSITY OF
   A STRONGER UNION, FOR AT PRESENT WE HANG SO LOOSELY TOGETHER THAT WE ARE
   IN DANGER OF HANGING ONE ANOTHER; and it appears to me more likely that
   the Union may be strengthened by the adoption of another Cord, than by
   twisting a new strand into the old one.

   Before I publish my third Letter, I should be glad of an opportunity of
   talking the subject over. Mr. Livingston once mentioned to me that I
   should see an occasion of taking up the subject of the Confederation, and
   as this letter has a reference thereto, I wish when you have an
   opportunity that you would show it [to] him.

   As I bargained with you for blots and blunders, I close with reminding you
   of it. I have just time to close my letter and that is all. It is now past
   eight O'clock, the 20th of November which is the anniversary of the
   evacuation of Fort Lee in which I had my share of difficulties and I am
   going to spend the evening with a Whig of that year who was in the same
   situation.

   I am Sir Your Obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
