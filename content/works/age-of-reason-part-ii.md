   The Age Of Reason - Part II

   PREFACE

   I HAVE mentioned in the former part of The Age of Reason that it had long
   been my intention to publish my thoughts upon Religion; but that I had
   originally reserved it to a later period in life, intending it to be the
   last work I should undertake. The circumstances, however, which existed in
   France in the latter end of the year 1793, determined me to delay it no
   longer. The just and humane principles of the Revolution which Philosophy
   had first diffused, had been departed from. The Idea, always dangerous to
   Society as it is derogatory to the Almighty, -- that priests could forgive
   sins, -- though it seemed to exist no longer, had blunted the feelings of
   humanity, and callously prepared men for the commission of all crimes. The
   intolerant spirit of church persecution had transferred itself into
   politics; the tribunals, stiled Revolutionary, supplied the place of an
   Inquisition; and the Guillotine of the Stake. I saw many of my most
   intimate friends destroyed; others daily carried to prison; and I had
   reason to believe, and had also intimations given me, that the same danger
   was approaching myself.

   Under these disadvantages, I began the former part of the Age of Reason; I
   had, besides, neither Bible nor Testament [It must be borne in mind that
   throughout this work Paine generaly means by "Bible" only the Old
   Testamut, and speaks of the Now as the "Testament." -- Editor.] to refer
   to, though I was writing against both; nor could I procure any;
   notwithstanding which I have produced a work that no Bible Believer,
   though writing at his ease and with a Library of Church Books about him,
   can refute. Towards the latter end of December of that year, a motion was
   made and carried, to exclude foreigners from the Convention. There were
   but two, Anacharsis Cloots and myself; and I saw I was particularly
   pointed at by Bourdon de l'Oise, in his speech on that motion.

   Conceiving, after this, that I had but a few days of liberty, I sat down
   and brought the work to a close as speedily as possible; and I had not
   finished it more than six hours, in the state it has since appeared, [This
   is an allusion to the essay which Paine wrote at an earlier part of 1793.
   See Introduction. -- Editor.] before a guard came there, about three in
   the morning, with an order signed by the two Committees of Public Safety
   and Surety General, for putting me in arrestation as a foreigner, and
   conveying me to the prison of the Luxembourg. I contrived, in my way
   there, to call on Joel Barlow, and I put the Manuscript of the work into
   his hands, as more safe than in my possession in prison; and not knowing
   what might be the fate in France either of the writer or the work, I
   addressed it to the protection of the citizens of the United States.

   It is justice that I say, that the guard who executed this order, and the
   interpreter to the Committee of General Surety, who accompanied them to
   examine my papers, treated me not only with civility, but with respect.
   The keeper of the 'Luxembourg, Benoit, a man of good heart, shewed to me
   every friendship in his power, as did also all his family, while he
   continued in that station. He was removed from it, put into arrestation,
   and carried before the tribunal upon a malignant accusation, but
   acquitted.

   After I had been in Luxembourg about three weeks, the Americans then in
   Paris went in a body to the Convention to reclaim me as their countryman
   and friend; but were answered by the President, Vadier, who was also
   President of the Committee of Surety General, and had signed the order for
   my arrcstation, that I was born in England. [These excited Americans do
   not seem to have understood or reported the most important item in
   Vadeer's reply, namely that their application was "unofficial," i.e. not
   made through or sanctioned by Gouverneur Morris, American Minister. For
   the detailed history of all this see vol. iii. -- Editor.] I heard no
   more, after this, from any person out of the walls of the prison, till the
   fall of Robespierre, on the 9th of Thermidor -- July 27, 1794.

   About two months before this event, I was seized with a fever that in its
   progress had every symptom of becoming mortal, and from the effects of
   which I am not recovered. It was then that I remembered with renewed
   satisfaction, and congratulated myself most sincerely, on having written
   the former part of The Age of Reason. I had then but little expectation of
   surviving, and those about me had less. I know therefore by experience the
   conscientious trial of my own principles.

   I was then with three chamber comrades: Joseph Vanheule of Bruges, Charles
   Bastfni, and Michael Robyns of Louvain. The unceasing and anxious
   attention of these three friends to me, by night and day, I remember with
   gratitude and mention with pleasure. It happened that a physician (Dr.
   Graham) and a surgeon, (Mr. Bond,) part of the suite of General O'Hara,
   [The officer who at Yorktown, Virginia, carried out the sword of
   Cornwallis for surrender, and satirically offered it to Rochambcau instead
   of Washington. Paine loaned him 300 pounds when he (O'Hara) left the
   prison, the money he had concealed in the lock of his cell-door. --
   Edifor.] were then in the Luxembourg: I ask not myself whether it be
   convenient to them, as men under the English Government, that I express to
   them my thanks; but I should reproach myself if I did not; and also to the
   physician of the Luxembourg, Dr. Markoski.

   I have some reason to believe, because I cannot discover any other, that
   this illness preserved me in existence. Among the papers of Robespierre
   that were examined and reported upon to the Convention by a Committee of
   Deputies, is a note in the hand writing of Robespierre, in the following
   words:

   "Ddmander que Thomas Paine soit decrete d'accusation, pour l'interet de
   l'Amerique autant que de la France."From what cause it was that the
   intention was not put in execution, I know not, and cannot inform myself;
   and therefore I ascribe it to impossibility, on account of that illness.

   [Demand that Thomas Paine be decreed of accusation, for the interest of
   America, as well as of France.]

   The Convention, to repair as much as lay in their power the injustice I
   had sustained, invited me publickly and unanimously to return into the
   Convention, and which I accepted, to shew I could bear an injury without
   permitting it to injure my principles or my disposition. It is not because
   right principles have been violated, that they are to be abandoned.

   I have seen, since I have been at liberty, several publications written,
   some in America, and some in England, as answers to the former part of
   "The Age of Reason." If the authors of these can amuse themselves by so
   doing, I shall not interrupt them, They may write against the work, and
   against me, as much as they please; they do me more service than they
   intend, and I can have no objection that they write on. They will find,
   however, by this Second Part, without its being written as an answer to
   them, that they must return to their work, and spin their cobweb over
   again. The first is brushed away by accident.

   They will now find that I have furnished myself with a Bible and
   Testament; and I can say also that I have found them to be much worse
   books than I had conceived. If I have erred in any thing, in the former
   part of the Age of Reason, it has been by speaking better of some parts
   than they deserved.

   I observe, that all my opponents resort, more or less, to what they call
   Scripture Evidence and Bible authority, to help them out. They are so
   little masters of the subject, as to confound a dispute about authenticity
   with a dispute about doctrines; I will, however, put them right, that if
   they should be disposed to write any more, they may know how to begin.

   CHAPTER I - THE OLD TESTAMENT



   IT has often been said that any thing may be proved from the Bible; but
   before any thing can be admitted as proved by Bible, the Bible itself must
   be proved to be true; for if the Bible be not true, or the truth of it be
   doubtful, it ceases to have authority, and cannot be admitted as proof of
   any thing.

   It has been the practice of all Christian commentators on the Bible, and
   of all Christian priests and preachers, to impose the Bible on the world
   as a mass of truth, and as the word of God; they have disputed and
   wrangled, and have anathematized each other about the supposeable meaning
   of particular parts and passages therein; one has said and insisted that
   such a passage meant such a thing, another that it meant directly the
   contrary, and a third, that it meant neither one nor the other, but
   something different from both; and this they have called undffstanding the
   Bible.

   It has happened, that all the answers that I have seen to the former part
   of 'The Age of Reason' have been written by priests: and these pious men,
   like their predecessors, contend and wrangle, and understand the Bible;
   each understands it differently, but each understands it best; and they
   have agreed in nothing but in telling their readers that Thomas Paine
   understands it not.

   Now instead of wasting their time, and heating themselves in fractious
   disputations about doctrinal points drawn from the Bible, these men ought
   to know, and if they do not it is civility to inform them, that the first
   thing to be understood is, whether there is sufficient authority for
   believing the Bible to be the word of God, or whether there is not?

   There are matters in that book, said to be done by the express command of
   God, that are as shocking to humanity, and to every idea we have of moral
   justice, as any thing done by Robespierre, by Carrier, by Joseph le Bon,
   in France, by the English government in the East Indies, or by any other
   assassin in modern times. When we read in the books ascribed to Moses,
   Joshua, etc., that they (the Israelites) came by stealth upon whole
   nations of people, who, as the history itself shews, had given them no
   offence; that they put all those nations to the sword; that they spared
   neither age nor infancy; that they utterly destroyed men, women and
   children; that they left not a soul to breathe; expressions that are
   repeated over and over again in those books, and that too with exulting
   ferocity; are we sure these things are facts? are we sure that the Creator
   of man commissioned those things to be done? Are we sure that the books
   that tell us so were written by his authority?

   It is not the antiquity of a tale that is an evidence of its truth; on the
   contrary, it is a symptom of its being fabulous; for the more ancient any
   history pretends to be, the more it has the resemblance of a fable. The
   origin of every nation is buried in fabulous tradition, and that of the
   Jews is as much to be suspected as any other.

   To charger the commission of things upon the Almighty, which in their own
   nature, and by every rule of moral justice, are crimes, as all
   assassination is, and more especially the assassination of infants, is
   matter of serious concern. The Bible tells us, that those assassinations
   were done by the express command of God. To believe therefore the Bible to
   be true, we must unbelieve all our belief in the moral justice of God; for
   wherein could crying or smiling infants offend? And to read the Bible
   without horror, we must undo every thing that is tender, sympathising, and
   benevolent in the heart of man. Speaking for myself, if I had no other
   evidence that the Bible is fabulous, than the sacrifice I must make to
   believe it to be true, that alone would be sufficient to determine my
   choice.

   But in addition to all the moral evidence against the Bible, I will, in
   the progress of this work, produce such other evidence as even a priest
   cannot deny; and show, from that evidence, that the Bible is not entitled
   to credit, as being the word of God.

   But, before I proceed to this examination, I will show wherein the Bible
   differs from all other ancient writings with respect to the nature of the
   evidence necessary to establish its authenticity; and this is is the more
   proper to be done, because the advocates of the Bible, in their answers to
   the former part of 'The Age of Reason,' undertake to say, and they put
   some stress thereon, that the authenticity of the Bible is as well
   established as that of any other ancient book: as if our belief of the one
   could become any rule for our belief of the other.

   I know, however, but of one ancient book that authoritatively challenges
   universal consent and belief, and that is Euclid's Elements of Geometry;
   [Euclid, according to chronological history, lived three hundred years
   before Christ, and about one hundred before Archimedes; he was of the city
   of Alexandria, in Egypt. -- Author.] and the reason is, because it is a
   book of self-evident demonstration, entirely independent of its author,
   and of every thing relating to time, place, and circumstance. The matters
   contained in that book would have the same authority they now have, had
   they been written by any other person, or had the work been anonymous, or
   had the author never been known; for the identical certainty of who was
   the author makes no part of our belief of the matters contained in the
   book. But it is quite otherwise with respect to the books ascribed to
   Moses, to Joshua, to Samuel, etc.: those are books of testimony, and they
   testify of things naturally incredible; and therefore the whole of our
   belief, as to the authenticity of those books, rests, in the first place,
   upon the certainty that they were written by Moses, Joshua, and Samuel;
   secondly, upon the credit we give to their testimony. We may believe the
   first, that is, may believe the certainty of the authorship, and yet not
   the testimony; in the same manner that we may believe that a certain
   person gave evidence upon a case, and yet not believe the evidence that he
   gave. But if it should be found that the books ascribed to Moses, Joshua,
   and Samuel, were not written by Moses, Joshua, and Samuel, every part of
   the authority and authenticity of those books is gone at once; for there
   can be no such thing as forged or invented testimony; neither can there be
   anonymous testimony, more especially as to things naturally incredible;
   such as that of talking with God face to face, or that of the sun and moon
   standing still at the command of a man.

   The greatest part of the other ancient books are works of genius; of which
   kind are those ascribed to Homer, to Plato, to Aristotle, to Demosthenes,
   to Cicero, etc. Here again the author is not an essential in the credit we
   give to any of those works; for as works of genius they would have the
   same merit they have now, were they anonymous. Nobody believes the Trojan
   story, as related by Homer, to be true; for it is the poet only that is
   admired, and the merit of the poet will remain, though the story be
   fabulous. But if we disbelieve the matters related by the Bible authors
   (Moses for instance) as we disbelieve the things related by Homer, there
   remains nothing of Moses in our estimation, but an imposter. As to the
   ancient historians, from Herodotus to Tacitus, we credit them as far as
   they relate things probable and credible, and no further: for if we do, we
   must believe the two miracles which Tacitus relates were performed by
   Vespasian, that of curing a lame man, and a blind man, in just the same
   manner as the same things are told of Jesus Christ by his historians. We
   must also believe the miracles cited by Josephus, that of the sea of
   Pamphilia opening to let Alexander and his army pass, as is related of the
   Red Sea in Exodus. These miracles are quite as well authenticated as the
   Bible miracles, and yet we do not believe them; consequently the degree of
   evidence necessary to establish our belief of things naturally incredible,
   whether in the Bible or elsewhere, is far greater than that which obtains
   our belief to natural and probable things; and therefore the advocates for
   the Bible have no claim to our belief of the Bible because that we believe
   things stated in other ancient writings; since that we believe the things
   stated in those writings no further than they are probable and credible,
   or because they are self-evident, like Euclid; or admire them because they
   are elegant, like Homer; or approve them because they are sedate, like
   Plato; or judicious, like Aristotle.

   Having premised these things, I proceed to examine the authenticity of the
   Bible; and I begin with what are called the five books of Moses, Genesis,
   Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. My intention is to shew that
   those books are spurious, and that Moses is not the author of them; and
   still further, that they were not written in the time of Moses nor till
   several hundred years afterwards; that they are no other than an attempted
   history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have
   lived, and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant
   and stupid pretenders to authorship, several hundred years after the death
   of Moses; as men now write histories of things that happened, or are
   supposed to have happened, several hundred or several thousand years ago.

   The evidence that I shall produce in this case is from the books
   themselves; and I will confine myself to this evidence only. Were I to
   refer for proofs to any of the ancient authors, whom the advocates of the
   Bible call prophane authors, they would controvert that authority, as I
   controvert theirs: I will therefore meet them on their own ground, and
   oppose them with their own weapon, the Bible.

   In the first place, there is no affirmative evidence that Moses is the
   author of those books; and that he is the author, is altogether an
   unfounded opinion, got abroad nobody knows how. The style and manner in
   which those books are written give no room to believe, or even to suppose,
   they were written by Moses; for it is altogether the style and manner of
   another person speaking of Moses. In Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, (for
   every thing in Genesis is prior to the times of Moses and not the least
   allusion is made to him therein,) the whole, I say, of these books is in
   the third person; it is always, the Lord said unto Moses, or Moses said
   unto the Lord; or Moses said unto the people, or the people said unto
   Moses; and this is the style and manner that historians use in speaking of
   the person whose lives and actions they are writing. It may be said, that
   a man may speak of himself in the third person, and, therefore, it may be
   supposed that Moses did; but supposition proves nothing; and if the
   advocates for the belief that Moses wrote those books himself have nothing
   better to advance than supposition, they may as well be silent.

   But granting the grammatical right, that Moses might speak of himself in
   the third person, because any man might speak of himself in that manner,
   it cannot be admitted as a fact in those books, that it is Moses who
   speaks, without rendering Moses truly ridiculous and absurd: -- for
   example, Numbers xii. 3: "Now the man Moses was very MEEK, above all the
   men which were on the face of the earth." If Moses said this of himself,
   instead of being the meekest of men, he was one of the most vain and
   arrogant coxcombs; and the advocates for those books may now take which
   side they please, for both sides are against them: if Moses was not the
   author, the books are without authority; and if he was the author, the
   author is without credit, because to boast of meekness is the reverse of
   meekness, and is a lie in sentiment.

   In Deuteronomy, the style and manner of writing marks more evidently than
   in the former books that Moses is not the writer. The manner here used is
   dramatical; the writer opens the subject by a short introductory
   discourse, and then introduces Moses as in the act of speaking, and when
   he has made Moses finish his harrangue, he (the writer) resumes his own
   part, and speaks till he brings Moses forward again, and at last closes
   the scene with an account of the death, funeral, and character of Moses.

   This interchange of speakers occurs four times in this book: from the
   first verse of the first chapter, to the end of the fifth verse, it is the
   writer who speaks; he then introduces Moses as in the act of making his
   harrangue, and this continues to the end of the 40th verse of the fourth
   chapter; here the writer drops Moses, and speaks historically of what was
   done in consequence of what Moses, when living, is supposed to have said,
   and which the writer has dramatically rehearsed.

   The writer opens the subject again in the first verse of the fifth
   chapter, though it is only by saying that Moses called the people of
   Isracl together; he then introduces Moses as before, and continues him as
   in the act of speaking, to the end of the 26th chapter. He does the same
   thing at the beginning of the 27th chapter; and continues Moses as in the
   act of speaking, to the end of the 28th chapter. At the 29th chapter the
   writer speaks again through the whole of the first verse, and the first
   line of the second verse, where he introduces Moses for the last time, and
   continues him as in the act of speaking, to the end of the 33d chapter.

   The writer having now finished the rehearsal on the part of Moses, comes
   forward, and speaks through the whole of the last chapter: he begins by
   telling the reader, that Moses went up to the top of Pisgah, that he saw
   from thence the land which (the writer says) had been promised to Abraham,
   Isaac, and Jacob; that he, Moses, died there in the land of Moab, that he
   buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, but that no man knoweth of his
   sepulchre unto this day, that is unto the time in which the writer lived
   who wrote the book of Deuteronomy. The writer then tells us, that Moses
   was one hundred and ten years of age when he died -- that his eye was not
   dim, nor his natural force abated; and he concludes by saying, that there
   arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom, says this
   anonymous writer, the Lord knew face to face.

   Having thus shewn, as far as grammatical evidence implics, that Moses was
   not the writer of those books, I will, after making a few observations on
   the inconsistencies of the writer of the book of Deuteronomy, proceed to
   shew, from the historical and chronological evidence contained in those
   books, that Moses was not, because he could not be, the writer of them;
   and consequently, that there is no authority for believing that the
   inhuman and horrid butcheries of men, women, and children, told of in
   those books, were done, as those books say they were, at the command of
   God. It is a duty incumbent on every true deist, that he vindicates the
   moral justice of God against the calumnies of the Bible.

   The writer of the book of Deuteronomy, whoever he was, for it is an
   anonymous work, is obscure, and also contradictory with himself in the
   account he has given of Moses.

   After telling that Moses went to the top of Pisgah (and it does not appear
   from any account that he ever came down again) he tells us, that Moses
   died there in the land of Moab, and that he buried him in a valley in the
   land of Moab; but as there is no antecedent to the pronoun he, there is no
   knowing who he was, that did bury him. If the writer meant that he (God)
   buried him, how should he (the writer) know it? or why should we (the
   readers) believe him? since we know not who the writer was that tells us
   so, for certainly Moses could not himself tell where he was buried.

   The writer also tells us, that no man knoweth where the sepulchre of Moses
   is unto this day, meaning the time in which this writer lived; how then
   should he know that Moses was buried in a valley in the land of Moab? for
   as the writer lived long after the time of Moses, as is evident from his
   using the expression of unto this day, meaning a great length of time
   after the death of Moses, he certainly was not at his funeral; and on the
   other hand, it is impossible that Moses himself could say that no man
   knoweth where the sepulchre is unto this day. To make Moses the speaker,
   would be an improvement on the play of a child that hides himself and
   cries nobody can find me; nobody can find Moses.

   This writer has no where told us how he came by the speeches which he has
   put into the mouth of Moses to speak, and therefore we have a right to
   conclude that he either composed them himself, or wrote them from oral
   tradition. One or other of these is the more probable, since he has given,
   in the fifth chapter, a table of commandments, in which that called the
   fourth commandment is different from the fourth commandment in the
   twentieth chapter of Exodus. In that of Exodus, the reason given for
   keeping the seventh day is, because (says the commandment) God made the
   heavens and the earth in six days, and rested on the seventh; but in that
   of Deuteronomy, the reason given is, that it was the day on which the
   children of Israel came out of Egypt, and therefore, says this
   commandment, the Lord thy God commanded thee to kee the sabbath-day This
   makes no mention of the creation, nor that of the coming out of Egypt.
   There are also many things given as laws of Moses in this book, that are
   not to be found in any of the other books; among which is that inhuman and
   brutal law, xxi. 18, 19, 20, 21, which authorizes parents, the father and
   the mother, to bring their own children to have them stoned to death for
   what it pleased them to call stubbornness. -- But priests have always been
   fond of preaching up Deuteronomy, for Deuteronomy preaches up tythes; and
   it is from this book, xxv. 4, they have taken the phrase, and applied it
   to tything, that "thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth Out the
   corn:" and that this might not escape observation, they have noted it in
   the table of contents at the head of the chapter, though it is only a
   single verse of less than two lines. O priests! priests! ye are willing to
   be compared to an ox, for the sake of tythes. [An elegant pocket edition
   of Paine's Theological Works (London. R. Carlile, 1822) has in its title a
   picture of Paine, as a Moses in evening dress, unfolding the two tables of
   his "Age of Reason" to a famer from whom the Bishop of Llandaff (who
   replied to this work) has taken a sheaf and a lamb which he is carrying to
   a church at the summit of a well stocked hill. -- Editor.] -- Though it is
   impossible for us to know identically who the writer of Deuteronomy was,
   it is not difficult to discover him professionally, that he was some
   Jewish priest, who lived, as I shall shew in the course of this work, at
   least three hundred and fifty years after the time of Moses.

   I come now to speak of the historical and chronological evidence. The
   chronology that I shall use is the Bible chronology; for I mean not to go
   out of the Bible for evidence of any thing, but to make the Bible itself
   prove historically and chronologically that Moses is not the author of the
   books ascribed to him. It is therefore proper that I inform the readers
   (such an one at least as may not have the opportunity of knowing it) that
   in the larger Bibles, and also in some smaller ones, there is a series of
   chronology printed in the margin of every page for the purpose of shawing
   how long the historical matters stated in each page happened, or are
   supposed to have happened, before Christ, and consequently the distance of
   time between one historical circumstance and another.

   I begin with the book of Genesis. -- In Genesis xiv., the writer gives an
   account of Lot being taken prisoner in a battle between the four kings
   against five, and carried off; and that when the account of Lot being
   taken came to Abraham, that he armed all his household and marched to
   rescue Lot from the captors; and that he pursued them unto Dan. (ver. 14.)

   To shew in what manner this expression of Pursuing them unto Dan applies
   to the case in question, I will refer to two circumstances, the one in
   America, the other in France. The city now called New York, in America,
   was originally New Amsterdam; and the town in France, lately called Havre
   Marat, was before called Havre-de-Grace. New Amsterdam was changed to New
   York in the year 1664; Havre-de-Grace to Havre Marat in the year 1793.
   Should, therefore, any writing be found, though without date, in which the
   name of New-York should be mentioned, it would be certain evidence that
   such a writing could not have been written before, and must have been
   written after New Amsterdam was changed to New York, and consequently not
   till after the year 1664, or at least during the course of that year. And
   in like manner, any dateless writing, with the name of Havre Marat, would
   be certain evidence that such a writing must have been written after
   Havre-de-Grace became Havre Marat, and consequently not till after the
   year 1793, or at least during the course of that year.

   I now come to the application of those cases, and to show that there was
   no such place as Dan till many years after the death of Moses; and
   consequently, that Moses could not be the writer of the book of Genesis,
   where this account of pursuing them unto Dan is given.

   The place that is called Dan in the Bible was originally a town of the
   Gentiles, called Laish; and when the tribe of Dan seized upon this town,
   they changed its name to Dan, in commemoration of Dan, who was the father
   of that tribe, and the great grandson of Abraham.

   To establish this in proof, it is necessary to refer from Genesis to
   chapter xviii. of the book called the Book of judges. It is there said
   (ver. 27) that "they (the Danites) came unto Laish to a people that were
   quiet and secure, and they smote them with the edge of the sword [the
   Bible is filled with murder] and burned the city with fire; and they built
   a city, (ver. 28,) and dwelt therein, and [ver. 29,] they called the name
   of the city Dan, after the name of Dan, their father; howbeit the name of
   the city was Laish at the first."

   This account of the Danites taking possession of Laish and changing it to
   Dan, is placed in the book of Judges immediately after the death of
   Samson. The death of Samson is said to have happened B.C. 1120 and that of
   Moses B.C. 1451; and, therefore, according to the historical arrangement,
   the place was not called Dan till 331 years after the death of Moses.

   There is a striking confusion between the historical and the chronological
   arrangement in the book of judges. The last five chapters, as they stand
   in the book, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, are put chronologically before all the
   preceding chapters; they are made to be 28 years before the 16th chapter,
   266 before the 15th, 245 before the 13th, 195 before the 9th, go before
   the 4th, and 15 years before the 1st chapter. This shews the uncertain and
   fabulous state of the Bible. According to the chronological arrangement,
   the taking of Laish, and giving it the name of Dan, is made to be twenty
   years after the death of Joshua, who was the successor of Moses; and by
   the historical order, as it stands in the book, it is made to be 306 years
   after the death of Joshua, and 331 after that of Moses; but they both
   exclude Moses from being the writer of Genesis, because, according to
   either of the statements, no such a place as Dan existed in the time of
   Moses; and therefore the writer of Genesis must have been some person who
   lived after the town of Laish had the name of Dan; and who that person was
   nobody knows, and consequently the book of Genesis is anonymous, and
   without authority.

   I come now to state another point of historical and chronological
   evidence, and to show therefrom, as in the preceding case, that Moses is
   not the author of the book of Genesis.

   In Genesis xxxvi. there is given a genealogy of the sons and descendants
   of Esau, who are called Edomites, and also a list by name of the kings of
   Edom; in enumerating of which, it is said, verse 31, "And these are the
   kings that reigned in Edom, before there reigned any king over the
   children of Israel."

   Now, were any dateless writing to be found, in which, speaking of any past
   events, the writer should say, these things happened before there was any
   Congress in America, or before there was any Convention in France, it
   would be evidence that such writing could not have been written before,
   and could only be written after there was a Congress in America or a
   Convention in France, as the case might be; and, consequently, that it
   could not be written by any person who died before there was a Congress in
   the one country, or a Convention in the other.

   Nothing is more frequent, as well in history as in conversation, than to
   refer to a fact in the room of a date: it is most natural so to do,
   because a fact fixes itself in the memory better than a date; secondly,
   because the fact includes the date, and serves to give two ideas at once;
   and this manner of speaking by circumstances implies as positively that
   the fact alluded to is past, as if it was so expressed. When a person in
   speaking upon any matter, says, it was before I was married, or before my
   son was born, or before I went to America, or before I went to France, it
   is absolutely understood, and intended to be understood, that he has been
   married, that he has had a son, that he has been in America, or been in
   France. Language does not admit of using this mode of expression in any
   other sense; and whenever such an expression is found anywhere, it can
   only be understood in the sense in which only it could have been used.

   The passage, therefore, that I have quoted -- that "these are the kings
   that reigned in Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of
   Israel," could only have been written after the first king began to reign
   over them; and consequently that the book of Genesis, so far from having
   been written by Moses, could not have been written till the time of Saul
   at least. This is the positive sense of the passage; but the expression,
   any king, implies more kings than one, at least it implies two, and this
   will carry it to the time of David; and, if taken in a general sense, it
   carries itself through all times of the Jewish monarchy.

   Had we met with this verse in any part of the Bible that professed to have
   been written after kings began to reign in Israel, it would have been
   impossible not to have seen the application of it. It happens then that
   this is the case; the two books of Chronicles, which give a history of all
   the kings of Israel, are professedly, as well as in fact, written after
   the Jewish monarchy began; and this verse that I have quoted, and all the
   remaining verses of Genesis xxxvi. are, word for word, In 1 Chronicles i.,
   beginning at the 43d verse.

   It was with consistency that the writer of the Chronicles could say as he
   has said, 1 Chron. i. 43, These are the kings that reigned in Edom, before
   there reigned any king ever the children of Israel," because he was going
   to give, and has given, a list of the kings that had reigned in Israel;
   but as it is impossible that the same expression could have been used
   before that period, it is as certain as any thing can be proved from
   historical language, that this part of Genesis is taken from Chronicles,
   and that Genesis is not so old as Chronicles, and probably not so old as
   the book of Homer, or as AEsop's Fables; admitting Homer to have been, as
   the tables of chronology state, contemporary with David or Solomon, and
   AEsop to have lived about the end of the Jewish monarchy.

   Take away from Genesis the belief that Moses was the author, on which only
   the strange belief that it is the word of God has stood, and there remains
   nothing of Genesis but an anonymous book of stories, fables, and
   traditionary or invented absurdities, or of downright lies. The story of
   Eve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the
   Arabian Tales, without the merit of being entertaining, and the account of
   men living to eight and nine hundred years becomes as fabulous as the
   immortality of the giants of the Mythology.

   Besides, the character of Moses, as stated in the Bible, is the most
   horrid that can be imagined. If those accounts be true, he was the wretch
   that first began and carried on wars on the score or on the pretence of
   religion; and under that mask, or that infatuation, committed the most
   unexampled atrocities that are to be found in the history of any nation.
   Of which I will state only one instance:

   When the Jewish army returned from one of their plundering and murdering
   excursions, the account goes on as follows (Numbers xxxi. 13): "And Moses,
   and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went
   forth to meet them without the camp; and Moses was wroth with the officers
   of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds,
   which came from the battle; and Moses said unto them, "Have ye saved all
   the women alive?" behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the
   counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of
   Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord. Now
   therefore, "kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman
   that hath known a man by lying with him; but all the women- children that
   have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for Yourselves."

   Among the detestable villains that in any period of the world have
   disgraced the name of man, it is impossible to find a greater than Moses,
   if this account be true. Here is an order to butcher the boys, to massacre
   the mothers, and debauch the daughters.

   Let any mother put herself in the situation of those mothers, one child
   murdered, another destined to violation, and herself in the hands of an
   executioner: let any daughter put herself in the situation of those
   daughters, destined as a prey to the murderers of a mother and a brother,
   and what will be their feelings? It is in vain that we attempt to impose
   upon nature, for nature will have her course, and the religion that
   tortures all her social ties is a false religion.

   After this detestable order, follows an account of the plunder taken, and
   the manner of dividing it; and here it is that the profanenegs of priestly
   hypocrisy increases the catalogue of crimes. Verse 37, "And the Lord's
   tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen; and the
   beeves were thirty and six thousand, of which the Lord's tribute was
   threescore and twelve; and the asses were thirty thousand, of which the
   Lord's tribute was threescore and one; and the persons were sixteen
   thousand, of which the Lord's tribute was thirty and two." In short, the
   matters contained in this chapter, as well as in many other parts of the
   Bible, are too horrid for humanity to read, or for decency to hear; for it
   appears, from the 35th verse of this chapter, that the number of
   women-children consigned to debauchery by the order of Moses was
   thirty-two thousand.

   People in general know not what wickedness there is in this pretended word
   of God. Brought up in habits of superstition, they take it for granted
   that the Bible is true, and that it is good; they permit themselves not to
   doubt of it, and they carry the ideas they form of the benevolence of the
   Almighty to the book which they have been taught to believe was written by
   his authority. Good heavens! it is quite another thing, it is a book of
   lies, wickedness, and blasphemy; for what can be greater blasphemy, than
   to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty!

   But to return to my subject, that of showing that Moses is not the author
   of the books ascribed to him, and that the Bible is spurious. The two
   instances I have already given would be sufficient, without any additional
   evidence, to invalidate the authenticity of any book that pretended to be
   four or five hundred years more ancient than the matters it speaks of,
   refers to, them as facts; for in the case of pursuing them unto Dan, and
   of the kings that reigned over the children of Israel; not even the flimsy
   pretence of prophecy can be pleaded. The expressions are in the preter
   tense, and it would be downright idiotism to say that a man could prophecy
   in the preter tense.

   But there are many other passages scattered throughout those books that
   unite in the same point of evidence. It is said in Exodus, (another of the
   books ascribed to Moses,) xvi. 35: "And the children of Israel did eat
   manna until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna untit they
   came unto the borders of the land of Canaan."

   Whether the children of Israel ate manna or not, or what manna was, or
   whether it was anything more than a kind of fungus or small mushroom, or
   other vegetable substance common to that part of the country, makes no
   part of my argument; all that I mean to show is, that it is not Moses that
   could write this account, because the account extends itself beyond the
   life time of Moses. Moses, according to the Bible, (but it is such a book
   of lies and contradictions there is no knowing which part to believe, or
   whether any) died in the wilderness, and never came upon the borders of
   'the land,of Canaan; and consequently, it could not be he that said what
   the children of Israel did, or what they ate when they came there. This
   account of eating manna, which they tell us was written by Moses, extends
   itself to the time of Joshua, the successor of Moses, as appears by the
   account given in the book of Joshua, after the children of Israel had
   passed the river Jordan, and came into the borders of the land of Canaan.
   Joshua, v. 12: "And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten
   of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any
   more, but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."

   But a more remarkable instance than this occurs in Deuteronomy; which,
   while it shows that Moses could not be the writer of that book, shows also
   the fabulous notions that prevailed at that time about giants' In
   Deuteronomy iii. 11, among the conquests said to be made by Moses, is an
   account of the taking of Og, king of Bashan: "For only Og, king of Bashan,
   remained of the race of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of
   iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the
   length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a
   man." A cubit is 1 foot 9 888/1000 inches; the length therefore of the bed
   was 16 feet 4 inches, and the breadth 7 feet 4 inches: thus much for this
   giant's bed. Now for the historical part, which, though the evidence is
   not so direct and positive as in the former cases, is nevertheless very
   presumable and corroborating evidence, and is better than the best
   evidence on the contrary side.

   The writer, by way of proving the existence of this giant, refers to his
   bed, as an ancient relick, and says, is it not in Rabbath (or Rabbah) of
   the children of Ammon? meaning that it is; for such is frequently the
   bible method of affirming a thing. But it could not be Moses that said
   this, because Moses could know nothing about Rabbah, nor of what was in
   it. Rabbah was not a city belonging to this giant king, nor was it one of
   the cities that Moses took. The knowledge therefore that this bed was at
   Rabbah, and of the particulars of its dimensions, must be referred to the
   time when Rabbah was taken, and this was not till four hundred years after
   the death of Moses; for which, see 2 Sam. xii. 26: "And Joab [David's
   general] fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the
   royal city," etc.

   As I am not undertaking to point out all the contradictions in time,
   place, and circumstance that abound in the books ascribed to Moses, and
   which prove to demonstration that those books could not be written by
   Moses, nor in the time of Moses, I proceed to the book of Joshua, and to
   shew that Joshua is not the author of that book, and that it is anonymous
   and without authority. The evidence I shall produce is contained in the
   book itself: I will not go out of the Bible for proof against the supposed
   authenticity of the Bible. False testimony is always good against itself.

   Joshua, according to Joshua i., was the immediate successor of Moses; he
   was, moreover, a military man, which Moses was not; and he continued as
   chief of the people of Israel twenty-five years; that is, from the time
   that Moses died, which, according to the Bible chronology, was B.C. 1451,
   until B.C. 1426, when, according to the same chronology, Joshua died. If,
   therefore, we find in this book, said to have been written by Joshua,
   references to facts done after the death of Joshua, it is evidence that
   Joshua could not be the author; and also that the book could not have been
   written till after the time of the latest fact which it records. As to the
   character of the book, it is horrid; it is a military history of rapine
   and murder, as savage and brutal as those recorded of his predecessor in
   villainy and hypocrisy, Moses; and the blasphemy consists, as in the
   former books, in ascribing those deeds to the orders of the Almighty.

   In the first place, the book of Joshua, as is the case in the preceding
   books, is written in the third person; it is the historian of Joshua that
   speaks, for it would have been absurd and vainglorious that Joshua should
   say of himself, as is said of him in the last verse of the sixth chapter,
   that "his fame was noised throughout all the country." -- I now come more
   immediately to the proof.

   In Joshua xxiv. 31, it is said "And Israel served the Lord all the days of
   Joshua, and all the days of the elders that over-lived Joshua." Now, in
   the name of common sense, can it be Joshua that relates what people had
   done after he was dead? This account must not only have been written by
   some historian that lived after Joshua, but that lived also after the
   elders that out-lived Joshua.

   There are several passages of a general meaning with respect to time,
   scattered throughout the book of Joshua, that carrics the time in which
   the book was written to a distance from the time of Joshua, but without
   marking by exclusion any particular time, as in the passage above quoted.
   In that passage, the time that intervened between the death of Joshua and
   the death of the elders is excluded descriptively and absolutely, and the
   evidence substantiates that the book could not have been written till
   after the death of the last.

   But though the passages to which I allude, and which I am going to quote,
   do not designate any particular time by exclusion, they imply a time far
   more distant from the days of Joshua than is contained between the death
   of Joshua and the death of the elders. Such is the passage, x. 14, where,
   after giving an account that the sun stood still upon Gibeon, and the moon
   in the valley of Ajalon, at the command of Joshua, (a tale only fit to
   amuse children) [NOTE: This tale of the sun standing still upon Motint
   Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, is one of those fables that
   detects itself. Such a circumstance could not have happened without being
   known all over the world. One half would have wondered why the sun did not
   rise, and the other why it did not set; and the tradition of it would be
   universal; whereas there is not a nation in the world that knows anything
   about it. But why must the moon stand still? What occasion could there be
   for moonlight in the daytime, and that too whilst the sun shined? As a
   poetical figure, the whole is well enough; it is akin to that in the song
   of Deborah and Barak, The stars in their courses fought against Sisera;
   but it is inferior to the figurative declaration of Mahomet to the persons
   who came to expostulate with him on his goings on, Wert thou, said he, to
   come to me with the sun in thy right hand and the moon in thy left, it
   should not alter my career. For Joshua to have exceeded Mahomet, he should
   have put the sun and moon, one in each pocket, and carried them as Guy
   Faux carried his dark lanthorn, and taken them out to shine as he might
   happen to want them. The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly
   related that it is difficult to class them separately. One step above the
   sublime makes the ridiculous, and one step above the ridiculous makes the
   sublime again; the account, however, abstracted from the poetical fancy,
   shews the ignorance of Joshua, for he should have commanded the earth to
   have stood still. -- Author.] the passage says: "And there was no day like
   that, before it, nor after it, that the Lord hearkened to the voice of a
   man."

   The time implied by the expression after it, that is, after that day,
   being put in comparison with all the time that passed before it, must, in
   order to give any expressive signification to the passage, mean a great
   letgth of time: -- for example, it would have been ridiculous to have said
   so the next day, or the next week, or the next month, or the next year; to
   give therefore meaning to the passage, comparative with the wonder it
   relates, and the prior time it alludes to, it must mean centuries of
   years; less however than one would be trifling, and less than two would be
   barely admissible.

   A distant, but general time is also expressed in chapter viii.; where,
   after giving an account of the taking the city of Ai, it is said, ver.
   28th, "And Joshua burned Ai, and made it an heap for ever, a desolation
   unto this day;" and again, ver. 29, where speaking of the king of Ai, whom
   Joshua had hanged, and buried at the entering of the gate, it is said,
   "And he raised thereon a great heap of stones, which remaineth unto this
   day," that is, unto the day or time in which the writer of the book of
   Joshua lived. And again, in chapter x. where, after speaking of the five
   kings whom Joshua had hanged on five trees, and then thrown in a cave, it
   is said, "And he laid great stones on the cave's mouth, which remain unto
   this very day."

   In enumerating the several exploits of Joshua, and of the tribes, and of
   the places which they conquered or attempted, it is said, xv. 63, "As for
   the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could
   not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah AT
   JERUSALEM unto this day." The question upon this passage is, At what time
   did the Jebusites and the children of Judah dwell together at Jerusalem?
   As this matter occurs again in judges i. I shall reserve my observations
   till I come to that part.

   Having thus shewn from the book of Joshua itself, without any auxiliary
   evidence whatever, that Joshua is not the author of that book, and that it
   is anonymous, and consequently without authority, I proceed, as
   before-mentioned, to the book of Judges.

   The book of Judges is anonymous on the face of it; and, therefore, even
   the pretence is wanting to call it the word of God; it has not so much as
   a nominal voucher; it is altogether fatherless.

   This book begins with the same expression as the book of Joshua. That of
   Joshua begins, chap i. 1, Now after the death of Moses, etc., and this of
   the Judges begins, Now after the death of Joshua, etc. This, and the
   similarity of stile between the two books, indicate that they are the work
   of the same author; but who he was, is altogether unknown; the only point
   that the book proves is that the author lived long after the time of
   Joshua; for though it begins as if it followed immediately after his
   death, the second chapter is an epitome or abstract of the whole book,
   which, according to the Bible chronology, extends its history through a
   space of 306 years; that is, from the death of Joshua, B.C. 1426 to the
   death of Samson, B.C. 1120, and only 25 years before Saul went to seek his
   father's asses, and was made king. But there is good reason to believe,
   that it was not written till the time of David, at least, and that the
   book of Joshua was not written before the same time.

   In Judges i., the writer, after announcing the death of Joshua, proceeds
   to tell what happened between the children of Judah and the native
   inhabitants of the land of Canaan. In this statement the writer, having
   abruptly mentioned Jerusalem in the 7th verse, says immediately after, in
   the 8th verse, by way of explanation, "Now the children of Judah had
   fought against Jerusalem, and taken it;" consequently this book could not
   have been written before Jerusalem had been taken. The reader will
   recollect the quotation I have just before made from Joshua xv. 63, where
   it said that the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem
   at this day; meaning the time when the book of Joshua was written.

   The evidence I have already produced to prove that the books I have
   hitherto treated of were not written by the persons to whom they are
   ascribed, nor till many years after their death, if such persons ever
   lived, is already so abundant, that I can afford to admit this passage
   with less weight than I am entitled to draw from it. For the case is, that
   so far as the Bible can be credited as an history, the city of Jerusalem
   was not taken till the time of David; and consequently, that the book of
   Joshua, and of Judges, were not written till after the commencement of the
   reign of David, which was 370 years after the death of Joshua.

   The name of the city that was afterward called Jerusalem was originally
   Jebus, or Jebusi, and was the capital of the Jebusites. The account of
   David's taking this city is given in 2 Samuel, v. 4, etc.; also in 1
   Chron. xiv. 4, etc. There is no mention in any part of the Bible that it
   was ever taken before, nor any account that favours such an opinion. It is
   not said, either in Samuel or in Chronicles, that they "utterly destroyed
   men, women and children, that they left not a soul to breathe," as is said
   of their other conquests; and the silence here observed implies that it
   was taken by capitulation; and that the Jebusites, the native inhabitants,
   continued to live in the place after it was taken. The account therefore,
   given in Joshua, that "the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah" at
   Jerusalem at this day, corresponds to no other time than after taking the
   city by David.

   Having now shown that every book in the Bible, from Genesis to Judges, is
   without authenticity, I come to the book of Ruth, an idle, bungling story,
   foolishly told, nobody knows by whom, about a strolling country-girl
   creeping slily to bed to her cousin Boaz. [The text of Ruth does not imply
   the unpleasant sense Paine's words are likely to convey. -- Editer.]
   Pretty stuff indeed to be called the word of God. It is, however, one of
   the best books in the Bible, for it is free from murder and rapine.

   I come next to the two books of Samuel, and to shew that those books were
   not written by Samuel, nor till a great length of time after the death of
   Samuel; and that they are, like all the former books, anonymous, and
   without authority.

   To be convinced that these books have been written much later than the
   time of Samuel, and consequently not by him, it is only necessary to read
   the account which the writer gives of Saul going to seek his father's
   asses, and of his interview with Samuel, of whom Saul went to enquire
   about those lost asses, as foolish people nowa-days go to a conjuror to
   enquire after lost things.

   The writer, in relating this story of Saul, Samuel, and the asses, does
   not tell it as a thing that had just then happened, but as an ancient
   story in the time this writer lived; for he tells it in the language or
   terms used at the time that Samuel lived, which obliges the writer to
   explain the story in the terms or language used in the time the writer
   lived.

   Samuel, in the account given of him in the first of those books, chap. ix.
   13 called the seer; and it is by this term that Saul enquires after him,
   ver. 11, "And as they [Saul and his servant] went up the hill to the city,
   they found young maidens going out to draw water; and they said unto them,
   Is the seer here? "Saul then went according to the direction of these
   maidens, and met Samuel without knowing him, and said unto him, ver. 18,
   "Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is? and Samuel answered
   Saul, and said, I am the seer."

   As the writer of the book of Samuel relates these questions and answers,
   in the language or manner of speaking used in the time they are said to
   have been spoken, and as that manner of speaking was out of use when this
   author wrote, he found it necessary, in order to make the story
   understood, to explain the terms in which these questions and answers are
   spoken; and he does this in the 9th verse, where he says, "Before-tune in
   Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come let us go
   to the seer; for he that is now called a prophet, was before-time called a
   seer." This proves, as I have before said, that this story of Saul,
   Samuel, and the asses, was an ancient story at the time the book of Samuel
   was written, and consequently that Samuel did not write it, and that the
   book is without authenticity,

   But if we go further into those books the evidence is still more positive
   that Samuel is not the writer of them; for they relate things that did not
   happen till several years after the death of Samuel. Samuel died before
   Saul; for i Samuel, xxviii. tells, that Saul and the witch of Endor
   conjured Samuel up after he was dead; yet the history of matters contained
   in those books is extended through the remaining part of Saul's life, and
   to the latter end of the life of David, who succceded Saul. The account of
   the death and burial of Samuel (a thing which he could not write himself)
   is related in i Samuel xxv.; and the chronology affixed to this chapter
   makes this to be B.C. 106O; yet the history of this first book is brought
   down to B.C. 1056, that is, to the death of Saul, which was not till four
   years after the death of Samuel.

   The second book of Samuel begins with an account of things that did not
   happen till four years after Samuel was dead; for it begins with the reign
   of David, who succeeded Saul, and it goes on to the end of David's reign,
   which was forty-three years after the death of Samuel; and, therefore, the
   books are in themselves positive evidence that they were not written by
   Samuel.

   I have now gone through all the books in the first part of the Bible, to
   which the names of persons are affixed, as being the authors of those
   books, and which the church, styling itself the Christian church, have
   imposed upon the world as the writings of Moses, Joshua and Samuel; and I
   have detected and proved the falsehood of this imposition. -- And now ye
   priests, of every description, who have preached and written against the
   former part of the 'Age of Reason,' what have ye to say? Will ye with all
   this mass of evidence against you, and staring you in the face, still have
   the assurance to march into your pulpits, and continue to impose these
   books on your congregations, as the works of inspired penmen and the word
   of God? when it is as evident as demonstration can make truth appear, that
   the persons who ye say are the authors, are not the authors, and that ye
   know not who the authors are. What shadow of pretence have ye now to
   produce for continuing the blasphemous fraud? What have ye still to offer
   against the pure and moral religion of deism, in support of your system of
   falsehood, idolatry, and pretended revelation? Had the cruel and murdering
   orders, with which the Bible is filled, and the numberless torturing
   executions of men, women, and children, in consequence of those orders,
   been ascribed to some friend, whose memory you revered, you would have
   glowed with satisfaction at detecting the falsehood of the charge, and
   gloried in defending his injured fame. It is because ye are sunk in the
   cruelty of superstition, or feel no interest in the honour of your
   Creator, that ye listen to the horrid tales of the Bible, or hear them
   with callous indifference. The evidence I have produced, and shall still
   produce in the course of this work, to prove that the Bible is without
   authority, will, whilst it wounds the stubbornness of a priest, relieve
   and tranquillize the minds of millions: it will free them from all those
   hard thoughts of the Almighty which priestcraft and the Bible had infused
   into their minds, and which stood in everlasting opposition to all their
   ideas of his moral justice and benevolence.

   I come now to the two books of Kings, and the two books of Chronicles. --
   Those books are altogether historical, and are chiefly confined to the
   lives and actions of the Jewish kings, who in general were a parcel of
   rascals: but these are matters with which we have no more concern than we
   have with the Roman emperors, or Homer's account of the Trojan war.
   Besides which, as those books are anonymous, and as we know nothing of the
   writer, or of his character, it is impossible for us to know what degree
   of credit to give to the matters related therein. Like all other ancient
   histories, they appear to be a jumble of fable and of fact, and of
   probable and of improbable things, but which distance of time and place,
   and change of circumstances in the world, have rendered obsolete and
   uninteresting.

   The chief use I shall make of those books will be that of comparing them
   with each other, and with other parts of the Bible, to show the confusion,
   contradiction, and cruelty in this pretended word of God.

   The first book of Kings begins with the reign of Solomon, which, according
   to the Bible chronology, was B.C. 1015; and the second book ends B.C. 588,
   being a little after the reign of Zedekiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, after
   taking Jerusalem and conquering the Jews, carried captive to Babylon. The
   two books include a space of 427 years.

   The two books of Chroniclcs are an history of the same times, and in
   general of the same persons, by another author; for it would be absurd to
   suppose that the same author wrote the history twice over. The first book
   of Chronicles (after giving the genealogy from Adam to Saul, which takes
   up the first nine chapters) begins with the reign of David; and the last
   book ends, as in the last book of Kings, soon, after the reign of
   Zedekiah, about B.C. 588. The last two verses of the last chapter bring
   the history 52 years more forward, that is, to 536. But these verses do
   not belong to the book, as I shall show when I come to speak of the book
   of Ezra.

   The two books of Kings, besides the history of Saul, David, and Solomon,
   who reigned over all Israel, contain an abstract of the lives of seventeen
   kings, and one queen, who are stiled kings of Judah; and of nineteen, who
   are stiled kings of Israel; for the Jewish nation, immediately on the
   death of Solomon, split into two parties, who chose separate kings, and
   who carried on most rancorous wars against each other.

   These two books are little more than a history of assassinations,
   treachery, and wars. The cruelties that the Jews had accustomed themselves
   to practise on the Canaanites, whose country they had savagely invaded,
   under a pretended gift from God, they afterwards practised as furiously on
   each other. Scarcely half their kings died a natural death, and in some
   instances whole families were destroyed to secure possession to the
   successor, who, after a few years, and sometimes only a few months, or
   less, shared the same fate. In 2 Kings x., an account is given of two
   baskets full of children's heads, seventy in number, being exposed at the
   entrance of the city; they were the children of Ahab, and were murdered by
   the orders of Jehu, whom Elisha, the pretended man of God, had anointed to
   be king over Israel, on purpose to commit this bloody deed, and
   assassinate his predecessor. And in the account of the reign of Menahem,
   one of the kings of Israel who had murdered Shallum, who had reigned but
   one month, it is said, 2 Kings xv. 16, that Menahem smote the city of
   Tiphsah, because they opened not the city to him, and all the women
   therein that were with child he ripped up.

   Could we permit ourselves to suppose that the Almighty would distinguish
   any nation of people by the name of his chosen people, we must suppose
   that people to have been an example to all the rest of the world of the
   purest piety and humanity, and not such a nation of ruffians and
   cut-throats as the ancient Jews were, -- a people who, corrupted by and
   copying after such monsters and imposters as Moses and Aaron, Joshua,
   Samuel, and David, had distinguished themselves above all others on the
   face of the known earth for barbarity and wickedness. If we will not
   stubbornly shut our eyes and steel our hearts it is impossible not to see,
   in spite of all that long-established superstition imposes upon the mind,
   that the flattering appellation of his chosen people is no other than a
   LIE which the priests and leaders of the Jews had invented to cover the
   baseness of their own characters; and which Christian priests sometimes as
   corrupt, and often as cruel, have professed to believe.

   The two books of Chronicles are a repetition of the same crimes; but the
   history is broken in several places, by the author leaving out the reign
   of some of their kings; and in this, as well as in that of Kings, there is
   such a frequent transition from kings of Judah to kings of Israel, and
   from kings of Israel to kings of Judah, that the narrative is obscure in
   the reading. In the same book the history sometimes contradicts itself:
   for example, in 2 Kings, i. 17, we are told, but in rather ambiguous
   terms, that after the death of Ahaziah, king of Israel, Jehoram, or Joram,
   (who was of the house of Ahab, reigned in his stead in the second Year of
   Jehoram, or Joram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; and in viii. 16, of
   the same book, it is said, "And in the fifth year of Joram, the son of
   Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram, the
   son of Jehoshaphat king of judah, began to reign." That is, one chapter
   says Joram of Judah began to reign in the second year of Joram of Israel;
   and the other chapter says, that Joram of Israel began to reign in the
   fifth year of Joram of Judah.

   Several of the most extraordinary matters related in one history, as
   having happened during the reign of such or such of their kings, are not
   to be found in the other, in relating the reign of the same king: for
   example, the two first rival kings, after the death of Solomon, were
   Rehoboam and Jeroboam; and in i Kings xii. and xiii. an account is given
   of Jeroboam making an offering of burnt incense, and that a man, who is
   there called a man of God, cried out against the altar (xiii. 2): "O
   altar, altar! thus saith the Lord: Behold, a child shall be born unto the
   house of David, Josiah by name, and upon thee shall he offer the priests
   of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be
   burned upon thee." Verse 4: "And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard
   the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel,
   that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him; and
   his hand which he put out against him dried up so that he could not pull
   it again to him."

   One would think that such an extraordinary case as this, (which is spoken
   of as a judgement,) happening to the chief of one of the parties, and that
   at the first moment of the separation of the Israelites into two nations,
   would, if it,. had been true, have been recorded in both histories. But
   though men, in later times, have believed all that the prophets have said
   unto them, it does appear that those prophets, or historians, disbelieved
   each other: they knew each other too well.

   A long account also is given in Kings about Elijah. It runs through
   several chapters, and concludes with telling, 2 Kings ii. 11, "And it came
   to pass, as they (Elijah and Elisha) still went on, and talked, that,
   behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and parted
   them both asunder, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." Hum!
   this the author of Chronicles, miraculous as the story is, makes no
   mention of, though he mentions Elijah by name; neither does he say
   anything of the story related in the second chapter of the same book of
   Kings, of a parcel of children calling Elisha bald head; and that this man
   of God (ver. 24) "turned back, and looked upon them, and cursed them in
   the name of the Lord; and there came forth two she-bears out of the wood,
   and tare forty and two children of them." He also passes over in silence
   the story told, 2 Kings xiii., that when they were burying a man in the
   sepulchre where Elisha had been buried, it happened that the dead man, as
   they were letting him down, (ver. 21) "touched the bones of Elisha, and he
   (the dead man) revived, and stood up on his feet." The story does not tell
   us whether they buried the man, notwithstanding he revived and stood upon
   his feet, or drew him up again. Upon all these stories the writer of the
   Chronicles is as silent as any writer of the present day, who did not
   chose to be accused of lying, or at least of romancing, would be about
   stories of the same kind.

   But, however these two historians may differ from each other with respect
   to the tales related by either, they are silent alike with respect to
   those men styled prophets whose writings fill up the latter part of the
   Bible. Isaiah, who lived in the time of Hezekiab, is mentioned in Kings,
   and again in Chronicles, when these histories are speaking of that reign;
   but except in one or two instances at most, and those very slightly, none
   of the rest are so much as spoken of, or even their existence hinted at;
   though, according to the Bible chronology, they lived within the time
   those histories were written; and some of them long before. If those
   prophets, as they are called, were men of such importance in their day, as
   the compilers of the Bible, and priests and commentators have since
   represented them to be, how can it be accounted for that not one of those
   histories should say anything about them?

   The history in the books of Kings and of Chronicles is brought forward, as
   I have already said, to the year B.C. 588; it will, therefore, be proper
   to examine which of these prophets lived before that period.

   Here follows a table of all the prophets, with the times in which they
   lived before Christ, according to the chronology affixed to the first
   chapter of each of the books of the prophets; and also of the number of
   years they lived before the books of Kings and Chronicles were written:

   [NOTE In 2 Kings xiv. 25, the name of Jonah is mentioned on account of the

   to Nineveh, nor to his encounter with the whale. -- Author.]

   This table is either not very honourable for the Bible historians, or not
   very honourable for the Bible prophets; and I leave to priests and
   commentators, who are very learned in little things, to settle the point
   of etiquette between the two; and to assign a reason, why the authors of
   Kings and of Chronicles have treated those prophets, whom, in the former
   part of the 'Age of Reason,' I have considered as poets, with as much
   degrading silence as any historian of the present day would treat Peter
   Pindar.

   I have one more observation to make on the book of Chronicles; after which
   I shall pass on to review the remaining books of the Bible.

   In my observations on the book of Genesis, I have quoted a passage from
   xxxvi. 31, which evidently refers to a time, after that kings began to
   reign over the children of Israel; and I have shown that as this verse is
   verbatim the same as in 1 Chronicles i. 43, where it stands consistently
   with the order of history, which in Genesis it does not, that the verse in
   Genesis, and a great part of the 36th chapter, have been taken from
   Chronicles; and that the book of Genesis, though it is placed first in the
   Bible, and ascribed to Moses, has been manufactured by some unknown
   person, after the book of Chronicles was written, which was not until at
   least eight hundred and sixty years after the time of Moses.

   The evidence I proceed by to substantiate this, is regular, and has in it
   but two stages. First, as I have already stated, that the passage in
   Genesis refers itself for time to Chronicles; secondly, that the book of
   Chronicles, to which this passage refers itself, was not begun to be
   written until at least eight hundred and sixty years after the time of
   Moses. To prove this, we have only to look into 1 Chronicles iii. 15,
   where the writer, in giving the genealogy of the descendants of David,
   mentions Zedekiah; and it was in the time of Zedekiah that Nebuchadnezzar
   conquered Jerusalem, B.C. 588, and consequently more than 860 years after
   Moses. Those who have superstitiously boasted of the antiquity of the
   Bible, and particularly of the books ascribed to Moses, have done it
   without examination, and without any other authority than that of one
   credulous man telling it to another: for, so far as historical and
   chronological evidence applies, the very first book in the Bible is not so
   ancient as the book of Homer, by more than three hundred years, and is
   about the same age with AEsop's Fables.

   I am not contending for the morality of Homer; on the contrary, I think it
   a book of false glory, and tending to inspire immoral and mischievous
   notions of honour; and with respect to AEsop, though the moral is in
   general just, the fable is often cruel; and the cruelty of the fable does
   more injury to the heart, especially in a child, than the moral does good
   to the judgment.

   Having now dismissed Kings and Chronicles, I come to the next in course,
   the book of Ezra.

   As one proof, among others I shall produce to shew the disorder in which
   this pretended word of God, the Bible, has been put together, and the
   uncertainty of who the authors were, we have only to look at the first
   three verses in Ezra, and the last two in 2 Chronicles; for by what kind
   of cutting and shuffling has it been that the first three verses in Ezra
   should be the last two verses in 2 Chronicles, or that the last two in 2
   Chronicles should be the first three in Ezra? Either the authors did not
   know their own works or the compilers did not know the authors.

   Last Two Verses of 2 Chronicles.

   Ver. 22. Now in the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, that the word of
   the Lord, spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah, might be accomplished, the Lord
   stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, that he made a
   proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing,
   saying.

   earth hath the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to
   build him an house in Jerusalem which is in Judah. Who is there among you
   of all his people? the Lord his God be with him, and let him go up. ***

   First Three Verses of Ezra.

   Ver. 1. Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of
   the Lord, by the mouth of Jeremiah, might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred
   up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, that he made a proclamation
   throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying.

   2. Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me
   all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an
   house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

   3. Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let
   him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord
   God of Israel (he is the God) which is in Jerusalem.

   *** The last verse in Chronicles is broken abruptly, and ends in the
   middle of the phrase with the word 'up' without signifying to what place.
   This abrupt break, and the appearance of the same verses in different
   books, show as I have already said, the disorder and ignorance in which
   the Bible has been put together, and that the compilers of it had no
   authority for what they were doing, nor we any authority for believing
   what they have done. [NOTE I observed, as I passed along, several broken
   and senseless passages in the Bible, without thinking them of consequence
   enough to be introduced in the body of the work; such as that, 1 Samuel
   xiii. 1, where it is said, "Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned
   two years over Israel, Saul chose him three thousand men," &c. The first
   part of the verse, that Saul reigned one year has no sense, since it does
   not tell us what Saul did, nor say any thing of what happened at the end
   of that one year; and it is, besides, mere absurdity to say he reigned one
   year, when the very next phrase says he had reigned two for if he had
   reigned two, it was impossible not to have reigned one. Another instance
   occurs in Joshua v. where the writer tells us a story of an angel (for
   such the table of contents at the head of the chapter calls him) appearing
   unto Joshua; and the story ends abruptly, and without any conclusion. The
   story is as follows: -- Ver. 13. "And it came to pass, when Joshua was by
   Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold there stood a
   man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went
   unto bim and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?"
   Verse 14, "And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I
   now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship and
   said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?" Verse 15, "And the
   captain of the Lord's host said unto Josbua, Loose thy shoe from off thy
   foot; for the place whereon thou standeth is holy. And Joshua did so." --
   And what then? nothing: for here the story ends, and the chapter too.

   Either this story is broken off in the middle, or it is a story told by
   some Jewish humourist in ridicule of Joshua's pretended mission from God,
   and the compilers of the Bible, not perceiving the design of the story,
   have told it as a serious matter. As a story of humour and ridicule it has
   a great deal of point; for it pompously introduces an angel in the figure
   of a man, with a drawn sword in his hand, before whom Joshua falls on his
   face to the earth, and worships (which is contrary to their second
   commandment;) and then, this most important embassy from heaven ends in
   telling Joshua to pull off his shoe. It might as well have told him to
   pull up his breeches.

   It is certain, however, that the Jews did not credit every thing their
   leaders told them, as appears from the cavalier manner in which they speak
   of Moses, when he was gone into the mount. As for this Moses, say they, we
   wot not what is become of him. Exod. xxxii. 1. -- Auther.]

   The only thing that has any appearance of certainty in the book of Ezra is
   the time in which it was written, which was immediately after the return
   of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity, about B.C. 536. Ezra (who,
   according to the Jewish commentators, is the same person as is called
   Esdras in the Apocrypha) was one of the persons who returned, and who, it
   is probable, wrote the account of that affair. Nebemiah, whose book
   follows next to Ezra, was another of the returned persons; and who, it is
   also probable, wrote the account of the same affair, in the book that
   bears his name. But those accounts are nothing to us, nor to any other
   person, unless it be to the Jews, as a part of the history of their
   nation; and there is just as much of the word of God in those books as
   there is in any of the histories of France, or Rapin's history of England,
   or the history of any other country.

   But even in matters of historical record, neither of those writers are to
   be depended upon. In Ezra ii., the writer gives a list of the tribes and
   families, and of the precise number of souls of each, that returned from
   Babylon to Jerusalem; and this enrolment of the persons so returned
   appears to have been one of the principal objects for writing the book;
   but in this there is an error that destroys the intention of the
   undertaking.

   The writer begins his enrolment in the following manner (ii. 3): "The
   children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy and four." Ver. 4,
   "The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two." And in this
   manner he proceeds through all the families; and in the 64th verse, he
   makes a total, and says, the whole congregation together was forty and two
   thousand three hundred and threescore.

   But whoever will take the trouble of casting up the several particulars,
   will find that the total is but 29,818; so that the error is 12,542. What
   certainty then can there be in the Bible for any thing?

   [Here Mr. Paine includes the long list of numbers from the Bible of all
   the children listed and the total thereof. This can be had directly from
   the Bible.]

   Nehemiah, in like manner, gives a list of the returned families, and of
   the number of each family. He begins as in Ezra, by saying (vii. 8): "The
   children of Parosh, two thousand three hundred and seventy-two; "and so on
   through all the families. (The list differs in several of the particulars
   from that of Ezra.) In ver. 66, Nehemiah makes a total, and says, as Ezra
   had said, "The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
   three hundred and threescore." But the particulars of this list make a
   total but of 31,089, so that the error here is 11,271. These writers may
   do well enough for Bible-makers, but not for any thing where truth and
   exactness is necessary.

   The next book in course is the book of Esther. If Madam Esther thought it
   any honour to offer herself as a kept mistress to Ahasuerus, or as a rival
   to Queen Vashti, who had refused to come to a drunken king in the midst of
   a drunken company, to be made a show of, (for the account says, they had
   been drinking seven days, and were merry,) let Esther and Mordecai look to
   that, it is no business of ours, at least it is none of mine; besides
   which, the story has a great deal the appearance of being fabulous, and is
   also anonymous. I pass on to the book of Job.

   The book of Job differs in character from all the books we have hitherto
   passed over. Treachery and murder make no part of this book; it is the
   meditations of a mind strongly impressed with the vicissitudes of human
   life, and by turns sinking under, and struggling against the pressure. It
   is a highly wrought composition, between willing submission and
   involuntary discontent; and shows man, as he sometimes is, more disposed
   to be resigned than he is capable of being. Patience has but a small share
   in the character of the person of whom the book treats; on the contrary,
   his grief is often impetuous; but he still endeavours to keep a guard upon
   it, and seems determined, in the midst of accumulating ills, to impose
   upon himself the hard duty of contentment.

   I have spoken in a respectful manner of the book of Job in the former part
   of the 'Age of Reason,' but without knowing at that time what I have
   learned since; which is, that from all the evidence that can be collected,
   the book of Job does not belong to the Bible.

   I have seen the opinion of two Hebrew commentators, Abenezra and Spinoza,
   upon this subject; they both say that the book of Job carries no internal
   evidence of being an Hebrew book; that the genius of the composition, and
   the drama of the piece, are not Hebrew; that it has been translated from
   another language into Hebrew, and that the author of the book was a
   Gentile; that the character represented under the name of Satan (which is
   the first and only time this name is mentioned in the Bible) [In a later
   work Paine notes that in "the Bible" (by which be always means the Old
   Testament alone) the word Satan occurs also in 1 Chron. xxi. 1, and
   remarks that the action there ascribed to Satan is in 2 Sam. xxiv. 1,
   attributed to Jehovah ("Essay on Dreams"). In these places, however, and
   in Ps. cix. 6, Satan means "adversary," and is so translated (A.S.
   version) in 2 Sam. xix. 22, and 1 Kings v. 4, xi. 25. As a proper name,
   with the article, Satan appears in the Old Testament only in Job and in
   Zech. iii. 1, 2. But the authenticity of the passage in Zechariah has been
   questioned, and it may be that in finding the proper name of Satan in Job
   alone, Paine was following some opinion met with in one of the authorities
   whose comments are condensed in his paragraph. -- Editor.] does not
   correspond to any Hebrew idea; and that the two convocations which the
   Deity is supposed to have made of those whom the poem calls sons of God,
   and the familiarity which this supposed Satan is stated to have with the
   Deity, are in the same case.

   It may also be observed, that the book shows itself to be the production
   of a mind cultivated in science, which the Jews, so far from being famous
   for, were very ignorant of. The allusions to objects of natural philosophy
   are frequent and strong, and are of a different cast to any thing in the
   books known to be Hebrew. The astronomical names, Pleiades, Orion, and
   Arcturus, are Greek and not Hebrew names, and it does not appear from any
   thing that is to be found in the Bible that the Jews knew any thing of
   astronomy, or that they studied it, they had no translation of those names
   into their own language, but adopted the names as they found them in the
   poem. [Paine's Jewish critic, David Levi, fastened on this slip ("Detence
   of the Old Testament," 1797, p. 152). In the original the names are Ash
   (Arcturus), Kesil' (Orion), Kimah' (Pleiades), though the identifications
   of the constellations in the A.S.V. have been questioned. -- Editor.]

   That the Jews did translate the literary productions of the Gentile
   nations into the Hebrew language, and mix them with their own, is not a
   matter of doubt; Proverbs xxxi. i, is an evidence of this: it is there
   said, The word of king Lemuel, the prophecy which his mother taught him.
   This verse stands as a preface to the proverbs that follow, and which are
   not the proverbs of Solomon, but of Lemuel; and this Lemuel was not one of
   the kings of Israel, nor of Judah, but of some other country, and
   consequently a Gentile. The Jews however have adopted his proverbs; and as
   they cannot give any account who the author of the book of Job was, nor
   how they came by the book, and as it differs in character from the Hebrew
   writings, and stands totally unconnected with every other book and chapter
   in the Bible before it and after it, it has all the circumstantial
   evidence of being originally a book of the Gentiles. [The prayer known by
   the name of Agur's Prayer, in Proverbs xxx., -- immediately preceding the
   proverbs of Lemuel, -- and which is the only sensible, well-conceived, and
   well-expressed prayer in the Bible, has much the appearance of being a
   prayer taken from the Gentiles. The name of Agur occurs on no other
   occasion than this; and he is introduced, together with the prayer
   ascribed to him, in the same manner, and nearly in the same words, that
   Lemuel and his proverbs are introduced in the chapter that follows. The
   first verse says, "The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy:
   "here the word prophecy is used with the same application it has in the
   following chapter of Lemuel, unconnected with anything of prediction. The
   prayer of Agur is in the 8th and 9th verses, "Remove far from me vanity
   and lies; give me neither riches nor poverty, but feed me with food
   convenient for me; lest I be full and deny thee and say, Who is the Lord?
   or lest I be poor and steal, and take the name of my God in vain." This
   has not any of the marks of being a Jewish prayer, for the Jews never
   prayed but when they were in trouble, and never for anything but victory,
   vengeance, or riches. -- Author. (Prov. xxx. 1, and xxxi. 1, the word
   "prophecy" in these verses is tranrinted "oracle" or "burden" (marg.) in
   the revised version. -- The prayer of Agur was quoted by Paine in his plea
   for the officers of Excise, 1772. -- Editer.]

   The Bible-makers, and those regulators of time, the Bible chronologists,
   appear to have been at a loss where to place and how to dispose of the
   book of Job; for it contains no one historical circumstance, nor allusion
   to any, that might serve to determine its place in the Bible. But it would
   not have answered the purpose of these men to have informed the world of
   their ignorance; and, therefore, they have affixed it to the aera of B.C.
   1520, which is during the time the Israelites were in Egypt, and for which
   they have just as much authority and no more than I should have for saying
   it was a thousand years before that period. The probability however is,
   that it is older than any book in the Bible; and it is the only one that
   can be read without indignation or disgust.

   We know nothing of what the ancient Gentile world (as it is called) was
   before the time of the Jews, whose practice has been to calumniate and
   blacken the character of all other nations; and it is from the Jewish
   accounts that we have learned to call them heathens. But, as far as we
   know to the contrary, they were a just and moral people, and not addicted,
   like the Jews, to cruelty and revenge, but of whose profession of faith we
   are unacquainted. It appears to have been their custom to personify both
   virtue and vice by statues and images, as is done now-a-days both by
   statuary and by painting; but it does not follow from this that they
   worshipped them any more than we do. -- I pass on to the book of,

   Psalms, of which it is not necessary to make much observation. Some of
   them are moral, and others are very revengeful; and the greater part
   relates to certain local circumstances of the Jewish nation at the time
   they were written, with which we have nothing to do. It is, however, an
   error or an imposition to call them the Psalms of David; they are a
   collection, as song-books are now-a- days, from different song-writers,
   who lived at different times. The 137th Psalm could not have been written
   till more than 400 years after the time of David, because it is written in
   commemoration of an event, the capitivity of the Jews in Babylon, which
   did not happen till that distance of time. "By the rivers of Babylon we
   sat down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon
   the willows, in the midst thereof; for there they that carried us away
   cartive required of us a song, saying, sing us one of the songs of Zion."
   As a man would say to an American, or to a Frenchman, or to an Englishman,
   sing us one of your American songs, or your French songs, or your English
   songs. This remark, with respect to the time this psalm was written, is of
   no other use than to show (among others already mentioned) the general
   imposition the world has been under with respect to the authors of the
   Bible. No regard has been paid to time, place, and circumstance; and the
   names of persons have been affixed to the several books which it was as
   impossible they should write, as that a man should walk in procession at
   his own funeral.

   The Book of Proverbs. These, like the Psalms, are a collection, and that
   from authors belonging to other nations than those of the Jewish nation,
   as I have shewn in the observations upon the book of Job; besides which,
   some of the Proverbs ascribed to Solomon did not appear till two hundred
   and fifty years after the death of Solomon; for it is said in xxv. i,
   "These are also proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah, king of
   Judah, copied out." It was two hundred and fifty years from the time of
   Solomon to the time of Hezekiah. When a man is famous and his name is
   abroad he is made the putative father of things he never said or did; and
   this, most probably, has been the case with Solomon. It appears to have
   been the fashion of that day to make proverbs, as it is now to make
   jest-books, and father them upon those who never saw them. [A "Tom Paine's
   Jest Book" had appeared in London with little or nothing of Paine in it.
   -- Editor.]

   The book of Ecclesiastes, or the Preacher, is also ascribed to Solomon,
   and that with much reason, if not with truth. It is written as the
   solitary reflections of a worn-out debauchee, such as Solomon was, who
   looking back on scenes he can no longer enjoy, cries out All is Vanity! A
   great deal of the metaphor and of the sentiment is obscure, most probably
   by translation; but enough is left to show they were strongly pointed in
   the original. [Those that look out of the window shall be darkened, is an
   obscure figure in translation for loss of sight. -- Author.] From what is
   transmitted to us of the character of Solomon, he was witty, ostentatious,
   dissolute, and at last melancholy. He lived fast, and died, tired of the
   world, at the age of fifty-eight years.

   Seven hundred wives, and three hundred concubines, are worse than none;
   and, however it may carry with it the appearance of heightened enjoyment,
   it defeats all the felicity of affection, by leaving it no point to fix
   upon; divided love is never happy. This was the case with Solomon; and if
   he could not, with all his pretensions to wisdom, discover it beforehand,
   he merited, unpitied, the mortification he afterwards endured. In this
   point of view, his preaching is unnecessary, because, to know the
   consequences, it is only necessary to know the cause. Seven hundred wives,
   and three hundred concubines would have stood in place of the whole book.
   It was needless after this to say that all was vanity and vexation of
   spirit; for it is impossible to derive happiness from the company of those
   whom we deprive of happiness.

   To be happy in old age it is necessary that we accustom ourselves to
   objects that can accompany the mind all the way through life, and that we
   take the rest as good in their day. The mere man of pleasure is miserable
   in old age; and the mere drudge in business is but little better: whereas,
   natural philosophy, mathematical and mechanical science, are a continual
   source of tranquil pleasure, and in spite of the gloomy dogmas of priests,
   and of superstition, the study of those things is the study of the true
   theology; it teaches man to know and to admire the Creator, for the
   principles of science are in the creation, and are unchangeable, and of
   divine origin.

   Those who knew Benjaman Franklin will recollect, that his mind was ever
   young; his temper ever serene; science, that never grows grey, was always
   his mistress. He was never without an object; for when we cease to have an
   object we become like an invalid in an hospital waiting for death.

   Solomon's Songs, amorous and foolish enough, but which wrinkled fanaticism
   has called divine. -- The compilers of the Bible have placed these songs
   after the book of Ecclesiastes; and the chronologists have affixed to them
   the aera of B.C. 1O14, at which time Solomon, according to the same
   chronology, was nineteen years of age, and was then forming his seraglio
   of wives and concubines. The Bible-makers and the chronologists should
   have managed this matter a little better, and either have said nothing
   about the time, or chosen a time less inconsistent with the supposed
   divinity of those songs; for Solomon was then in the honey-moon of one
   thousand debaucheries.

   It should also have occurred to them, that as he wrote, if he did write,
   the book of Ecclesiastes, long after these songs, and in which he exclaims
   that all is vanity and vexation of spirit, that he included those songs in
   that description. This is the more probable, because he says, or somebody
   for him, Ecclesiastes ii. 8, I got me men-singers, and women-singers (most
   probably to sing those songs], and musical instruments of all sores; and
   behold (Ver. ii), "all was vanity and vexation of spirit." The compilers
   however have done their work but by halves; for as they have given us the
   songs they should have given us the tunes, that we might sing them.

   The books called the books of the Prophets fill up all the remaining part
   of the Bible; they are sixteen in number, beginning with Isaiah and ending
   with Malachi, of which I have given a list in the observations upon
   Chronicles. Of these sixteen prophets, all of whom except the last three
   lived within the time the books of Kings and Chronicles were written, two
   only, Isaiah and Jeremiah, are mentioned in the history of those books. I
   shall begin with those two, reserving, what I have to say on the general
   character of the men called prophets to another part of the work.

   Whoever will take the trouble of reading the book ascribed to Isaiah, will
   find it one of the most wild and disorderly compositions ever put
   together; it has neither beginning, middle, nor end; and, except a short
   historical part, and a few sketches of history in the first two or three
   chapters, is one continued incoherent, bombastical rant, full of
   extravagant metaphor, without application, and destitute of meaning; a
   school-boy would scarcely have been excusable for writing such stuff; it
   is (at least in translation) that kind of composition and false taste that
   is properly called prose run mad.

   The historical part begins at chapter xxxvi., and is continued to the end
   of chapter xxxix. It relates some matters that are said to have passed
   during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah, at which time Isaiah lived.
   This fragment of history begins and ends abruptly; it has not the least
   connection with the chapter that precedes it, nor with that which follows
   it, nor with any other in the book. It is probable that Isaiah wrote this
   fragment himself, because he was an actor in the circumstances it treats
   of; but except this part there are scarcely two chapters that have any
   connection with each other. One is entitled, at the beginning of the first
   verse, the burden of Babylon; another, the burden of Moab; another, the
   burden of Damascus; another, the burden of Egypt; another, the burden of
   the Desert of the Sea; another, the burden of the Valley of Vision: as you
   would say the story of the Knight of the Burning Mountain, the story of
   Cinderella, or the glassen slipper, the story of the Sleeping Beauty in
   the Wood, etc., etc.

   I have already shown, in the instance of the last two verses of 2
   Chronicles, and the first three in Ezra, that the compilers of the Bible
   mixed and confounded the writings of different authors with each other;
   which alone, were there no other cause, is sufficient to destroy the
   authenticity of an compilation, because it is more than presumptive
   evidence that the compilers are ignorant who the authors were. A very
   glaring instance of this occurs in the book ascribed to Isaiah: the latter
   part of the 44th chapter, and the beginning of the 45th, so far from
   having been written by Isaiah, could only have been written by some person
   who lived at least an hundred and fifty years after Isaiah was dead.

   These chapters are a compliment to Cyrus, who permitted the Jews to return
   to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity, to rebuild Jerusalem and the
   temple, as is stated in Ezra. The last verse of the 44th chapter, and the
   beginning of the 45th [Isaiah] are in the following words: "That saith of
   Cyrus, he is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure; even saying
   to Jerusalem, thou shalt be built; and to the temple thy foundations shall
   be laid: thus saith the Lord to his enointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I
   have holden to subdue nations before him, and I will loose the loins of
   kings to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates shall not be
   shut; I will go before thee," etc.

   What audacity of church and priestly ignorance it is to impose this book
   upon the world as the writing of Isaiah, when Isaiah, according to their
   own chronology, died soon after the death of Hezekiah, which was B.C. 698;
   and the decree of Cyrus, in favour of the Jews returning to Jerusalem,
   was, according to the same chronology, B.C. 536; which is a distance of
   time between the two of 162 years. I do not suppose that the compilers of
   the Bible made these books, but rather that they picked up some loose,
   anonymous essays, and put them together under the names of such authors as
   best suited their purpose. They have encouraged the imposition, which is
   next to inventing it; for it was impossible but they must have observed
   it.

   When we see the studied craft of the scripture-makers, in making every
   part of this romantic book of school-boy's eloquence bend to the monstrous
   idea of a Son of God, begotten by a ghost on the body of a virgin, there
   is no imposition we are not justified in suspecting them of. Every phrase
   and circumstance are marked with the barbarous hand of superstitious
   torture, and forced into meanings it was impossible they could have. The
   head of every chapter, and the top of every page, are blazoned with the
   names of Christ and the Church, that the unwary reader might suck in the
   error before he began to read.

   Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son (Isa. vii. I4), has been
   interpreted to mean the person called Jesus Christ, and his mother Mary,
   and has been echoed through christendom for more than a thousand years;
   and such has been the rage of this opinion, that scarcely a spot in it but
   has been stained with blood and marked with desolation in consequence of
   it. Though it is not my intention to enter into controversy on subjects of
   this kind, but to confine myself to show that the Bible is spurious, --
   and thus, by taking away the foundation, to overthrow at once the whole
   structure of superstition raised thereon, -- I will however stop a moment
   to expose the fallacious application of this passage.

   Whether Isaiah was playing a trick with Ahaz, king of Judah, to whom this
   passage is spoken, is no business of mine; I mean only to show the
   misapplication of the passage, and that it has no more reference to Christ
   and his mother, than it has to me and my mother. The story is simply this:

   The king of Syria and the king of Israel (I have already mentioned that
   the Jews were split into two nations, one of which was called Judah, the
   capital of which was Jerusalem, and the other Israel) made war jointly
   against Ahaz, king of Judah, and marched their armies towards Jerusalem.
   Ahaz and his people became alarmed, and the account says (Is. vii. 2),
   Their hearts were moved as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.

   In this situation of things, Isaiah addresses himself to Ahaz, and assures
   him in the name of the Lord (the cant phrase of all the prophets) that
   these two kings should not succeed against him; and to satisfy Ahaz that
   this should be the case, tells him to ask a sign. This, the account says,
   Ahaz declined doing; giving as a reason that he would not tempt the Lord;
   upon which Isaiah, who is the speaker, says, ver. 14, "Therefore the Lord
   himself shall give you a sign; behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a
   son;" and the 16th verse says, "And before this child shall know to refuse
   the evil, and choose the good, the land which thou abhorrest or dreadest
   [meaning Syria and the kingdom of Israel] shall be forsaken of both her
   kings." Here then was the sign, and the time limited for the completion of
   the assurance or promise; namely, before this child shall know to refuse
   the evil and choose the good.

   Isaiah having committed himself thus far, it became necessary to him, in
   order to avoid the imputation of being a false prophet, and the
   consequences thereof, to take measures to make this sign appear. It
   certainly was not a difficult thing, in any time of the world, to find a
   girl with child, or to make her so; and perhaps Isaiah knew of one
   beforehand; for I do not suppose that the prophets of that day were any
   more to be trusted than the priests of this: be that, however, as it may,
   he says in the next chapter, ver. 2, "And I took unto me faithful
   witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of
   Jeberechiah, and I went unto the prophetess, and she conceived and bare a
   son."

   Here then is the whole story, foolish as it is, of this child and this
   virgin; and it is upon the barefaced perversion of this story that the
   book of Matthew, and the impudence and sordid interest of priests in later
   times, have founded a theory, which they call the gospel; and have applied
   this story to signify the person they call Jesus Christ; begotten, they
   say, by a ghost, whom they call holy, on the body of a woman engaged in
   marriage, and afterwards married, whom they call a virgin, seven hundred
   years after this foolish story was told; a theory which, speaking for
   myself, I hesitate not to believe, and to say, is as fabulous and as false
   as God is true. [In Is. vii. 14, it is said that the child should be
   called Immanuel; but this name was not given to either of the children,
   otherwise than as a character, which the word signifies. That of the
   prophetess was called Maher-shalalhash- baz, and that of Mary was called
   Jesus. -- Author.]

   But to show the imposition and falsehood of Isaiah we have only to attend
   to the sequel of this story; which, though it is passed over in silence in
   the book of Isaiah, is related in 2 Chronicles, xxviii; and which is, that
   instead of these two kings failing in their attempt against Ahaz, king of
   Judah, as Isaiah had pretended to foretel in the name of the Lord, they
   succeeded: Ahaz was defeated and destroyed; an hundred and twenty thousand
   of his people were slaughtered; Jerusalem was plundered, and two hundred
   thousand women and sons and daughters carried into captivity. Thus much
   for this lying prophet and imposter Isaiah, and the book of falsehoods
   that bears his name. I pass on to the book of

   Jeremiah. This prophet, as he is called, lived in the time that
   Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem, in the reign of Zedekiah, the last king
   of Judah; and the suspicion was strong against him that he was a traitor
   in the interest of Nebuchadnezzar. Every thing relating to Jeremiah shows
   him to have been a man of an equivocal character: in his metaphor of the
   potter and the clay, (ch. xviii.) he guards his prognostications in such a
   crafty manner as always to leave himself a door to escape by, in case the
   event should be contrary to what he had predicted. In the 7th and 8th
   verses he makes the Almighty to say, "At what instant I shall speak
   concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull
   down, and destroy it, if that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn
   from their evil, I will repent me of the evil that I thought to do unto
   them." Here was a proviso against one side of the case: now for the other
   side. Verses 9 and 10, "At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation,
   and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it do evil in my
   sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent me of the good
   wherewith I said I would benefit them." Here is a proviso against the
   other side; and, according to this plan of prophesying, a prophet could
   never be wrong, however mistaken the Almighty might be. This sort of
   absurd subterfuge, and this manner of speaking of the Almighty, as one
   would speak of a man, is consistent with nothing but the stupidity of the
   Bible.

   As to the authenticity of the book, it is only necessary to read it in
   order to decide positively that, though some passages recorded therein may
   have been spoken by Jeremiah, he is not the author of the book. The
   historical parts, if they can be called by that name, are in the most
   confused condition; the same events are several times repeated, and that
   in a manner different, and sometimes in contradiction to each other; and
   this disorder runs even to the last chapter, where the history, upon which
   the greater part of the book has been employed, begins anew, and ends
   abruptly. The book has all the appearance of being a medley of unconnected
   anecdotes respecting persons and things of that time, collected together
   in the same rude manner as if the various and contradictory accounts that
   are to be found in a bundle of newspapers, respecting persons and things
   of the present day, were put together without date, order, or explanation.
   I will give two or three examples of this kind.

   It appears, from the account of chapter xxxvii. that the army of
   Nebuchadnezzer, which is called the army of the Chaldeans, had besieged
   Jerusalem some time; and on their hearing that the army of Pharaoh of
   Egypt was marching against them, they raised the siege and retreated for a
   time. It may here be proper to mention, in order to understand this
   confused history, that Nebuchadnezzar had besieged and taken Jerusalem
   during the reign of Jehoakim, the redecessor of Zedekiah; and that it was
   Nebuchadnezzar who had make Zedekiah king, or rather viceroy; and that
   this second siege, of which the book of Jeremiah treats, was in
   consequence of the revolt of Zedekiah against Nebuchadnezzar. This will in
   some measure account for the suspicion that affixes itself to Jeremiah of
   being a traitor, and in the interest of Nebuchadnezzar, -- whom Jeremiah
   calls, xliii. 10, the servant of God.

   Chapter xxxvii. 11-13, says, "And it came to pass, that, when the army of
   the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem, for fear of Pharaoh's army,
   that Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem, to go (as this account states)
   into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the
   people; and when he was in the gate of Benjamin a captain of the ward was
   there, whose name was Irijah ... and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
   Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans; then Jeremiah said, It is false; I
   fall not away to the Chaldeans." Jeremiah being thus stopt and accused,
   was, after being examined, committed to prison, on suspicion of being a
   traitor, where he remained, as is stated in the last verse of this
   chapter.

   But the next chapter gives an account of the imprisonment of Jeremiah,
   which has no connection with this account, but ascribes his imprisonment
   to another circumstance, and for which we must go back to chapter xxi. It
   is there stated, ver. 1, that Zedekiah sent Pashur the son of Malchiah,
   and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, to Jeremiah, to enquire of
   him concerning Nebuchadnezzar, whose army was then before Jerusalem; and
   Jeremiah said to them, ver. 8, "Thus saith the Lord, Behold I set before
   you the way of life, and the way of death; he that abideth in this city
   shall die by the sword and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he
   that goeth out and falleth to the Clialdeans that besiege you, he shall
   live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey."

   This interview and conference breaks off abruptly at the end of the 10th
   verse of chapter xxi.; and such is the disorder of this book that we have
   to pass over sixteen chapters upon various subjects, in order to come at
   the continuation and event of this conference; and this brings us to the
   first verse of chapter xxxviii., as I have just mentioned. The chapter
   opens with saying, "Then Shaphatiah, the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son
   of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah,
   (here are more persons mentioned than in chapter xxi.) heard the words
   that Jeremiah spoke unto all the people, saying, Thus saith the Lord, He
   that remaineth in this city, shall die by the sword, by famine, and by the
   pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he
   shall have his life for a prey, and shall live"; [which are the words of
   the conference;] therefore, (say they to Zedekiah,) "We beseech thee, let
   this man be put to death, for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of
   war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking
   such words unto them; for this man seeketh not the welfare of the people,
   but the hurt: "and at the 6th verse it is said, "Then they took Jeremiah,
   and put him into the dungeon of Malchiah."

   These two accounts are different and contradictory. The one ascribes his
   imprisonment to his attempt to escape out of the city; the other to his
   preaching and prophesying in the city; the one to his being seized by the
   guard at the gate; the other to his being accused before Zedekiah by the
   conferees. [I observed two chapters in I Samuel (xvi. and xvii.) that
   contradict each other with respect to David, and the manner he became
   acquainted with Saul; as Jeremiah xxxvii. and xxxviii. contradict each
   other with respect to the cause of Jeremiah's imprisonment.

   In 1 Samuel, xvi., it is said, that an evil spirit of God troubled Saul,
   and that his servants advised him (as a remedy) "to seek out a man who was
   a cunning player upon the harp." And Saul said, ver. 17, " Provide me now
   a man that can play well, and bring him to me. Then answered one of his
   servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite,
   that is cunning in playing, and a mighty man, and a man of war, and
   prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with him;
   wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David, thy
   son. And (verse 21) David came to Saul, and stood before him, and he loved
   him greatly, and he became his armour-bearer; and when the evil spirit
   from God was upon Saul, (verse 23) David took his harp, and played with
   his hand, and Saul was refreshed, and was well."

   But the next chapter (xvii.) gives an account, all different to this, of
   the manner that Saul and David became acquainted. Here it is ascribed to
   David's encounter with Goliah, when David was sent by his father to carry
   provision to his brethren in the camp. In the 55th verse of this chapter
   it is said, "And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine
   (Goliah) he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is
   this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, 0 king, I cannot tell. And
   the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is. And as David
   returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought
   him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand; and Saul
   said unto him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I
   am the son of thy servant, Jesse, the Betblehemite," These two accounts
   belie each other, because each of them supposes Saul and David not to have
   known each other before. This book, the Bible, is too ridiculous for
   criticism. -- Author.]

   In the next chapter (Jer. xxxix.) we have another instance of the
   disordered state of this book; for notwithstanding the siege of the city
   by Nebuchadnezzar has been the subject of several of the preceding
   chapters, particularly xxxvii. and xxxviii., chapter xxxix. begins as if
   not a word had been said upon the subject, and as if the reader was still
   to be informed of every particular respecting it; for it begins with
   saying, ver. 1, "In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth
   month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, against
   Jerusalem, and besieged it," etc.

   But the instance in the last chapter (lii.) is still more glaring; for
   though the story has been told over and over again, this chapter still
   supposes the reader not to know anything of it, for it begins by saying,
   ver. i, "Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
   he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Hamutal,
   the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah." (Ver. 4,) "And it came to pass in the
   ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of
   Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against
   it, and built forts against it," etc.

   It is not possible that any one man, and more particularly Jeremiah, could
   have been the writer of this book. The errors are such as could not have
   been committed by any person sitting down to compose a work. Were I, or
   any other man, to write in such a disordered manner, no body would read
   what was written, and every body would suppose that the writer was in a
   state of insanity. The only way, therefore, to account for the disorder
   is, that the book is a medley of detached unauthenticated anecdotes, put
   together by some stupid book-maker, under the name of Jeremiah; because
   many of them refer to him, and to the circumstances of the times he lived
   in.

   Of the duplicity, and of the false predictions of Jeremiah, I shall
   mention two instances, and then proceed to review the remainder of the
   Bible.

   It appears from chapter xxxviii. that when Jeremiah was in prison,
   Zedekiah sent for him, and at this interview, which was private, Jeremiah
   pressed it strongly on Zedekiah to surrender himself to the enemy. "If,"
   says he, (ver. 17,) thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of
   Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live," etc. Zedekiah was
   apprehensive that what passed at this conference should be known; and he
   said to Jeremiah, (ver. 25,) "If the princes [meaning those of Judah] hear
   that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee,
   Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from
   us, and we will not put thee to death; and also what the king said unto
   thee; then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before
   the king that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die
   there. Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him, and "he
   told them according to all the words the king had comenanded." Thus, this
   man of God, as he is called, could tell a lie, or very strongly
   prevaricatc, when he supposed it would answer his purpose; for certainly
   he did not go to Zedekiah to make this supplication, neither did he make
   it; he went because he was sent for, and he employed that opportunity to
   advise Zedekiah to surrender himself to Nebuchadnezzar.

   In chapter xxxiv. 2-5, is a prophecy of Jeremiah to Zedekiah in these
   words: "Thus saith the Lord, Behold I will give this city into the hand of
   the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire; and thou shalt not
   escape out of his hand, but thou shalt surely be taken, and delivered into
   his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and
   he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. Yet
   hear the word of the Lord; O Zedekiah, king, of Judah, thus saith the
   Lord, Thou shalt not die by the sword, but thou shalt die in Peace; and
   with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee,
   so shall they burn odours for thee, and they will lament thee, saying, Ah,
   Lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the Lord."

   Now, instead of Zedekiah beholding the eyes of the king of Babylon, and
   speaking with him mouth to mouth, and dying in peace, and with the burning
   of odours, as at the funeral of his fathers, (as Jeremiah had declared the
   Lord himself had pronounced,) the reverse, according to chapter Iii., 10,
   11 was the case; it is there said, that the king of Babylon slew the sons
   of Zedekiah before his eyes: then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and
   bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison
   till the day of his death.

   What then can we say of these prophets, but that they are impostors and
   liars?

   As for Jeremiah, he experienced none of those evils. He was taken into
   favour by Nebuchadnezzar, who gave him in charge to the captain of the
   guard (xxxix, 12), "Take him (said he) and look well to him, and do him no
   harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee." Jeremiah joined
   himself afterwards to Nebuchadnezzar, and went about prophesying for him
   against the Egyptians, who had marched to the relief of Jerusalem while it
   was besieged. Thus much for another of the lying prophets, and the book
   that bears his name.

   I have been the more particular in treating of the books ascribed to
   Isaiah and Jeremiah, because those two are spoken of in the books of Kings
   and Chronicles, which the others are not. The remainder of the books
   ascribed to the men called prophets I shall not trouble myself much about;
   but take them collectively into the observations I shall offer on the
   character of the men styled prophets.

   In the former part of the 'Age of Reason,' I have said that the word
   prophet was the Bible-word for poet, and that the flights and metaphors of
   Jewish poets have been foolishly erected into what are now called
   prophecies. I am sufficiently justified in this opinion, not only because
   the books called the prophecies are written in poetical language, but
   because there is no word in the Bible, except it be the word prophet, that
   describes what we mean by a poet. I have also said, that the word
   signified a performer upon musical instruments, of which I have given some
   instances; such as that of a company of prophets, prophesying with
   psalteries, with tabrets, with pipes, with harps, etc., and that Saul
   prophesied with them, 1 Sam. x., 5. It appears from this passage, and from
   other parts in the book of Samuel, that the word prophet was confined to
   signify poetry and music; for the person who was supposed to have a
   visionary insight into concealed things, was not a prophet but a seer, [I
   know not what is the Hebrew word that corresponds to the word seer in
   English; but I observe it is translated into French by Le Voyant, from the
   verb voir to see, and mhich means the person who sees, or the seer. --
   Author.

   The Hebrew word for Seer, in 1 Samuel ix., transliterated, is chozeh, the
   gazer, it is translated in Is. xlvii. 13, "the stargazers." -- Editor.] (i
   Sam, ix. 9;) and it was not till after the word seer went out of use
   (which most probably was when Saul banished those he called wizards) that
   the profession of the seer, or the art of seeing, became incorporated into
   the word prophet.

   According to the modern meaning of the word prophet and prophesying, it
   signifies foretelling events to a great distance of time; and it became
   necessary to the inventors of the gospel to give it this latitude of
   meaning, in order to apply or to stretch what they call the prophecies of
   the Old Testament, to the times of the New. But according to the Old
   Testament, the prophesying of the seer, and afterwards of the prophet, so
   far as the meaning of the word "seer" was incorporated into that of
   prophet, had reference only to things of the time then passing, or very
   closely connected with it; such as the event of a battle they were going
   to engage in, or of a journey, or of any enterprise they were going to
   undertake, or of any circumstance then pending, or of any difficulty they
   were then in; all of which had immediate reference to themselves (as in
   the case already mentioned of Ahaz and Isaiah with respect to the
   expression, Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son,) and not to any
   distant future time. It was that kind of prophesying that orresponds to
   what we call fortune-telling; such as casting nativities, predicting
   riches, fortunate or unfortunate marriages, conjuring for lost goods,
   etc.; and it is the fraud of the Christian church, not that of the Jews,
   and the ignorance and the superstition of modern, not that of ancient
   times, that elevated those poetical, musical, conjuring, dreaming,
   strolling gentry, into the rank they have since had.

   But, besides this general character of all the prophets, they had also a
   particular character. They were in parties, and they prophesied for or
   against, according to the party they were with; as the poetical and
   political writers of the present day write in defence of the party they
   associate with against the other.

   After the Jews were divided into two nations, that of Judah and that of
   Israel, each party had its prophets, who abused and accused each other of
   being false prophets, lying prophets, impostors, etc.

   The prophets of the party of Judah prophesied against the prophets of the
   party of Israel; and those of the party of Israel against those of Judah.
   This party prophesying showed itself immediately on the separation under
   the first two rival kings, Rehoboam and Jeroboam. The prophet that cursed,
   or prophesied against the altar that Jeroboam had built in Bethel, was of
   the party of Judah, where Rehoboam was king; and he was way-laid on his
   return home by a prophet of the party of Israel, who said unto him (i
   Kings xiii.) "Art thou the man of God that came from Judah? and he said, I
   am." Then the prophet of the party of Israel said to him "I am a prophet
   also, as thou art, [signifying of Judah,] and an angel spake unto me by
   the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee unto thine house,
   that he may eat bread and drink water; but (says the 18th verse) he lied
   unto him." The event, however, according to the story, is, that the
   prophet of Judah never got back to Judah; for he was found dead on the
   road by the contrivance of the prophet of Israel, who no doubt was called
   a true prophet by his own party, and the prophet of Judah a lying brophet.

   In 2 Kings, iii., a story is related of prophesying or conjuring that
   shews, in several particulars, the character of a prophet. Jehoshaphat
   king of Judah, and Joram king of Israel, had for a while ceased their
   party animosity, and entered into an alliance; and these two, together
   with the king of Edom, engaged in a war against the king of Moab. After
   uniting and marching their armies, the story says, they were in great
   distress for water, upon which Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here a
   prophet of the Lord, that we may enquire of the Lord by him? and one of
   the servants of the king of Israel said here is Elisha. [Elisha was of the
   party of Judah.] And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah said, The word of the
   Lord is with him." The story then says, that these three kings went down
   to Elisha; and when Elisha [who, as I have said, was a Judahmite prophet]
   saw the King of Israel, he said unto him, "What have I to do with thee,
   get thee to the prophets of thy father and the prophets of thy mother. Nay
   but, said the king of Israel, the Lord hath called these three kings
   together, to deliver them into the hands of the king of Moab," (meaning
   because of the distress they were in for water;) upon which Elisha said,
   "As the Lord of hosts liveth before whom I stand, surely, were it not that
   I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not look
   towards thee nor see thee." Here is all the venom and vulgarity of a party
   prophet. We are now to see the performance, or manner of prophesying.

   Ver. 15. "Bring me," (said Elisha), "a minstrel; and it came to pass, when
   the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him." Here is the
   farce of the conjurer. Now for the prophecy: "And Elisha said, [singing
   most probably to the tune he was playing], Thus saith the Lord, Make this
   valley full of ditches; "which was just telling them what every countryman
   could have told them without either fiddle or farce, that the way to get
   water was to dig for it.

   But as every conjuror is not famous alike for the same thing, so neither
   were those prophets; for though all of them, at least those I have spoken
   of, were famous for lying, some of them excelled in cursing. Elisha, whom
   I have just mentioned, was a chief in this branch of prophesying; it was
   he that cursed the forty-two children in the name of the Lord, whom the
   two she-bears came and devoured. We are to suppose that those children
   were of the party of Israel; but as those who will curse will lie, there
   is just as much credit to be given to this story of Elisha's two she-
   bears as there is to that of the Dragon of Wantley, of whom it is said:

   There was another description of men called prophets, that amused
   themselves with dreams and visions; but whether by night or by day we know
   not. These, if they were not quite harmless, were but little mischievous.
   Of this class are

   EZEKIEL and DANIEL; and the first question upon these books, as upon all
   the others, is, Are they genuine? that is, were they written by Ezekiel
   and Daniel?

   Of this there is no proof; but so far as my own opinion goes, I am more
   inclined to believe they were, than that they were not. My reasons for
   this opinion are as follows: First, Because those books do not contain
   internal evidence to prove they were not written by Ezekiel and Daniel, as
   the books ascribed to Moses, Joshua, Samuel, etc., prove they were not
   written by Moses, Joshua, Samuel, etc.

   Secondly, Because they were not written till after the Babylonish
   captivity began; and there is good reason to believe that not any book in
   the bible was written before that period; at least it is proveable, from
   the books themselves, as I have already shown, that they were not written
   till after the commencement of the Jewish monarchy.

   Thirdly, Because the manner in which the books ascribed to Ezekiel and
   Daniel are written, agrees with the condition these men were in at the
   time of writing them.

   Had the numerous commentators and priests, who have foolishly employed or
   wasted their time in pretending to expound and unriddle those books, been
   carred into captivity, as Ezekiel and Daniel were, it would greatly have
   improved their intellects in comprehending the reason for this mode of
   writing, and have saved them the trouble of racking their invention, as
   they have done to no purpose; for they would have found that themselves
   would be obliged to write whatever they had to write, respecting their own
   affairs, or those of their friends, or of their country, in a concealed
   manner, as those men have done.

   These two books differ from all the rest; for it is only these that are
   filled with accounts of dreams and visions: and this difference arose from
   the situation the writers were in as prisoners of war, or prisoners of
   state, in a foreign country, which obliged them to convey even the most
   trifling information to each other, and all their political projects or
   opinions, in obscure and metaphorical terms. They pretend to have dreamed
   dreams, and seen visions, because it was unsafe for them to speak facts or
   plain language. We ought, however, to suppose, that the persons to whom
   they wrote understood what they meant, and that it was not intended
   anybody else should. But these busy commentators and priests have been
   puzzling their wits to find out what it was not intended they should know,
   and with which they have nothing to do.

   Ezekiel and Daniel were carried prisoners to Babylon, under the first
   captivity, in the time of Jehoiakim, nine years before the second
   captivity in the time of Zedekiah. The Jews were then still numerous, and
   had considerable force at Jerusalem; and as it is natural to suppose that
   men in the situation of Ezekiel and Daniel would be meditating the
   recovery of their country, and their own deliverance, it is reasonable to
   suppose that the accounts of dreams and visions with which these books are
   filled, are no other than a disguised mode of correspondence to facilitate
   those objects: it served them as a cypher, or secret alphabet. If they are
   not this, they are tales, reveries, and nonsense; or at least a fanciful
   way of wearing off the wearisomeness of captivity; but the presumption is,
   they are the former.

   Ezekiel begins his book by speaking of a vision of cherubims, and of a
   wheel within a wheel, which he says he saw by the river Chebar, in the
   land of his captivity. Is it not reasonable to suppose that by the
   cherubims he meant the temple at Jerusalem, where they had figures of
   cherubims? and by a wheel within a wheel (which as a figure has always
   been understood to signify political contrivance) the project or means of
   recovering Jerusalem? In the latter part of his book he supposes himself
   transported to Jerusalem, and into the temple; and he refers back to the
   vision on the river Chebar, and says, (xliii- 3,) that this last vision
   was like the vision on the river Chebar; which indicates that those
   pretended dreams and visions had for their object the recovery of
   Jerusalem, and nothing further.

   As to the romantic interpretations and applications, wild as the dreams
   and visions they undertake to explain, which commentators and priests have
   made of those books, that of converting them into things which they call
   prophecies, and making them bend to times and circumstances as far remote
   even as the present day, it shows the fraud or the extreme folly to which
   credulity or priestcraft can go.

   Scarcely anything can be more absurd than to suppose that men situated as
   Ezekiel and Daniel were, whose country was over-run, and in the possession
   of the enemy, all their friends and relations in captivity abroad, or in
   slavery at home, or massacred, or in continual danger of it; scarcely any
   thing, I say, can be more absurd than to suppose that such men should find
   nothing to do but that of employing their time and their thoughts about
   what was to happen to other nations a thousand or two thousand years after
   they were dead; at the same time nothing more natural than that they
   should meditate the recovery of Jerusalem, and their own deliverance; and
   that this was the sole object of all the obscure and apparently frantic
   writing contained in those books.

   In this sense the mode of writing used in those two books being forced by
   necessity, and not adopted by choice, is not irrational; but, if we are to
   use the books as prophecies, they are false. In Ezekiel xxix. 11.,
   speaking of Egypt, it is said, "No foot of man shall pass through it, nor
   foot of beast pass through it; neither shall it be inhabited for forty
   years." This is what never came to pass, and consequently it is false, as
   all the books I have already reviewed are. -- I here close this part of
   the subject.

   In the former part of 'The Age of Reason' I have spoken of Jonah, and of
   the story of him and the whale. -- A fit story for ridicule, if it was
   written to be believed; or of laughter, if it was intended to try what
   credulity could swallow; for, if it could swallow Jonah and the whale it
   could swallow anything.

   But, as is already shown in the observations on the book of Job and of
   Proverbs, it is not always certain which of the books in the Bible are
   originally Hebrew, or only translations from the books of the Gentiles
   into Hebrew; and, as the book of Jonah, so far from treating of the
   affairs of the Jews, says nothing upon that subject, but treats altogether
   of the Gentiles, it is more probable that it is a book of the Gentiles
   than of the Jews, [I have read in an ancient Persian poem (Saadi, I
   believe, but have mislaid the reference) this phrase: "And now the whale
   swallowed Jonah: the sun set." -- Editer.] and that it has been written as
   a fable to expose the nonsense, and satyrize the vicious and malignant
   character, of a Bible-prophet, or a predicting priest.

   Jonah is represented, first as a disobedient prophet, running away from
   his mission, and taking shelter aboard a vessel of the Gentiles, bound
   from Joppa to Tarshish; as if he ignorantly supposed, by such a paltry
   contrivance, he could hide himself where God could not find him. The
   vessel is overtaken by a storm at sea; and the mariners, all of whom are
   Gentiles, believing it to be a judgement on account of some one on board
   who had committed a crime, agreed to cast lots to discover the offender;
   and the lot fell upon Jonah. But before this they had cast all their wares
   and merchandise over-board to lighten the vessel, while Jonah, like a
   stupid fellow, was fast asleep in the hold.

   After the lot had designated Jonah to be the offender, they questioned him
   to know who and what he was? and he told them he was an Hebrew; and the
   story implies that he confessed himself to be guilty. But these Gentiles,
   instead of sacrificing him at once without pity or mercy, as a company of
   Bible-prophets or priests would have done by a Gentile in the same case,
   and as it is related Samuel had done by Agag, and Moses by the women and
   children, they endeavoured to save him, though at the risk of their own
   lives: for the account says, "Nevertheless [that is, though Jonah was a
   Jew and a foreigner, and the cause of all their misfortunes, and the loss
   of their cargo] the men rowed hard to bring the boat to land, but they
   could not, for the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them." Still
   however they were unwilling to put the fate of the lot into execution; and
   they cried, says the account, unto the Lord, saying, "We beseech thee, O
   Lord, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent
   blood; for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee." Meaning thereby,
   that they did not presume to judge Jonah guilty, since that he might be
   innocent; but that they considered the lot that had fallen upon him as a
   decree of God, or as it pleased God. The address of this prayer shows that
   the Gentiles worshipped one Supreme Being, and that they were not
   idolaters as the Jews represented them to be. But the storm still
   continuing, and the danger encreasing, they put the fate of the lot into
   execution, and cast Jonah in the sea; where, according to the story, a
   great fish swallowed him up whole and alive!

   We have now to consider Jonah securely housed from the storm in the fish's
   belly. Here we are told that he prayed; but the prayer is a made-up
   prayer, taken from various parts of the Psalms, without connection or
   consistency, and adapted to the distress, but not at all to the condition
   that Jonah was in. It is such a prayer as a Gentile, who might know
   something of the Psalms, could copy out for him. This circumstance alone,
   were there no other, is sufficient to indicate that the whole is a made-up
   story. The prayer, however, is supposed to have answered the purpose, and
   the story goes on, (taking-off at the same time the cant language of a
   Bible-prophet,) saying, "The Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out
   Jonah upon dry land."

   Jonah then received a second mission to Nineveh, with which he sets out;
   and we have now to consider him as a preacher. The distress he is
   represented to have suffered, the remembrance of his own disobedience as
   the cause of it, and the miraculous escape he is supposed to have had,
   were sufficient, one would conceive, to have impressed him with sympathy
   and benevolence in the execution of his mission; but, instead of this, he
   enters the city with denunciation and malediction in his mouth, crying,
   "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown."

   We have now to consider this supposed missionary in the last act of his
   mission; and here it is that the malevolent spirit of a Bible-prophet, or
   of a predicting priest, appears in all that blackness of character that
   men ascribe to the being they call the devil.

   Having published his predictions, he withdrew, says the story, to the east
   side of the city. -- But for what? not to contemplate in retirement the
   mercy of his Creator to himself or to others, but to wait, with malignant
   impatience, the destruction of Nineveh. It came to pass, however, as the
   story relates, that the Ninevites reformed, and that God, according to the
   Bible phrase, repented him of the evil he had said he would do unto them,
   and did it not. This, saith the first verse of the last chapter,
   displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry. His obdurate heart
   would rather that all Nineveh should be destroyed, and every soul, young
   and old, perish in its ruins, than that his prediction should not be
   fulfilled. To expose the character of a prophet still more, a gourd is
   made to grow up in the night, that promises him an agreeable shelter from
   the heat of the sun, in the place to which he is retired; and the next
   morning it dies.

   Here the rage of the prophet becomes excessive, and he is ready to destroy
   himself. "It is better, said he, for me to die than to live." This brings
   on a supposed expostulation between the Almighty and the prophet; in which
   the former says, "Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And Jonah
   said, I do well to be angry even unto death. Then said the Lord, Thou hast
   had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it
   to grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night; and should not
   I spare Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than threescore
   thousand persons, that cannot discern between their right hand and their
   left?"

   Here is both the winding up of the satire, and the moral of the fable. As
   a satire, it strikes against the character of all the Bible-prophets, and
   against all the indiscriminate judgements upon men, women and children,
   with which this lying book, the bible, is crowded; such as Noah's flood,
   the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, the extirpation of
   the Canaanites, even to suckling infants, and women with child; because
   the same reflection 'that there are more than threescore thousand persons
   that cannot discern between their right hand and their left,' meaning
   young children, applies to all their cases. It satirizes also the supposed
   partiality of the Creator for one nation more than for another.

   As a moral, it preaches against the malevolent spirit of prediction; for
   as certainly as a man predicts ill, he becomes inclined to wish it. The
   pride of having his judgment right hardens his heart, till at last he
   beholds with satisfaction, or sees with disappointment, the accomplishment
   or the failure of his predictions. -- This book ends with the same kind of
   strong and well-directed point against prophets, prophecies and
   indiscriminate judgements, as the chapter that Benjamin Franklin made for
   the Bible, about Abraham and the stranger, ends against the intolerant
   spirit of religious persecutions -- Thus much for the book Jonah. [The
   story of Abraham and the Fire-worshipper, ascribed to Franklin, is from
   Saadi. (See my "Sacred Anthology," p. 61.) Paine has often been called a
   "mere scoffer," but he seems to have been among the first to treat with
   dignity the book of Jonah, so especially liable to the ridicule of
   superficial readers, and discern in it the highest conception of Deity
   known to the Old Testament. -- Editor.]

   Of the poetical parts of the Bible, that are called prophecies, I have
   spoken in the former part of 'The Age of Reason,' and already in this,
   where I have said that the word for prophet is the Bible-word for Poet,
   and that the flights and metaphors of those poets, many of which have
   become obscure by the lapse of time and the change of circumstances, have
   been ridiculously erected into things called prophecies, and applied to
   purposes the writers never thought of. When a priest quotes any of those
   passages, he unriddles it agreeably to his own views, and imposes that
   explanation upon his congregation as the meaning of the writer. The whore
   of Babylon has been the common whore of all the priests, and each has
   accused the other of keeping the strumpet; so well do they agree in their
   explanations.

   There now remain only a few books, which they call books of the lesser
   prophets; and as I have already shown that the greater are impostors, it
   would be cowardice to disturb the repose of the little ones. Let them
   sleep, then, in the arms of their nurses, the priests, and both be
   forgotten together.

   I have now gone through the Bible, as a man would go through a wood with
   an axe on his shoulder, and fell trees. Here they lie; and the priests, if
   they can, may replant them. They may, perhaps, stick them in the ground,
   but they will never make them grow. -- I pass on to the books of the New
   Testament.

   CHAPTER II - THE NEW TESTAMENT



   THE New Testament, they tell us, is founded upon the prophecies of the
   Old; if so, it must follow the fate of its foundation.

   As it is nothing extraordinary that a woman should be with child before
   she was married, and that the son she might bring forth should be
   executed, even unjustly, I see no reason for not believing that such a
   woman as Mary, and such a man as Joseph, and Jesus, existed; their mere
   existence is a matter of indifference, about which there is no ground
   either to believe or to disbelieve, and which comes under the common head
   of, It may be so, and what then? The probability however is that there
   were such persons, or at least such as resembled them in part of the
   circumstances, because almost all romantic stories have been suggested by
   some actual circumstance; as the adventures of Robinson Crusoe, not a word
   of which is true, were suggested by the case of Alexander Selkirk.

   It is not then the existence or the non-existence, of the persons that I
   trouble myself about; it is the fable of Jesus Christ, as told in the New
   Testament, and the wild and visionary doctrine raised thereon, against
   which I contend. The story, taking it as it is told, is blasphemously
   obscene. It gives an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and
   while under this engagement, she is, to speak plain language, debauched by
   a ghost, under the impious pretence, (Luke i. 35,) that "the Holy Ghost
   shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee."
   Notwithstanding which, Joseph afterwards marries her, cohabits with her as
   his wife, and in his turn rivals the ghost. This is putting the story into
   intelligible language, and when told in this manner, there is not a priest
   but must be ashamed to own it. [Mary, the supposed virgin, mother of
   Jesus, had several other children, sons and daughters. See Matt. xiii. 55,
   56.--Author.]

   Obscenity in matters of faith, however wrapped up, is always a token of
   fable and imposture; for it is necessary to our serious belief in God,
   that we do not connect it with stories that run, as this does, into
   ludicrous interpretations. This story is, upon the face of it, the same
   kind of story as that of Jupiter and Leda, or Jupiter and Europa, or any
   of the amorous adventures of Jupiter; and shews, as is already stated in
   the former part of 'The Age of Reason,' that the Christian faith is built
   upon the heathen Mythology.

   As the historical parts of the New Testament, so far as concerns Jesus
   Christ, are confined to a very short space of time, less than two years,
   and all within the same country, and nearly to the same spot, the
   discordance of time, place, and circumstance, which detects the fallacy of
   the books of the Old Testament, and proves them to be impositions, cannot
   be expected to be found here in the same abundance. The New Testament
   compared with the Old, is like a farce of one act, in which there is not
   room for very numerous violations of the unities. There are, however, some
   glaring contradictions, which, exclusive of the fallacy of the pretended
   prophecies, are sufficient to show the story of Jesus Christ to be false.

   I lay it down as a position which cannot be controverted, first, that the
   agreement of all the parts of a story does not prove that story to be
   true, because the parts may agree, and the whole may be false; secondly,
   that the disagreement of the parts of a story proves the whole cannot be
   true. The agreement does not prove truth, but the disagreement proves
   falsehood positively.

   The history of Jesus Christ is contained in the four books ascribed to
   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.--The first chapter of Matthew begins with
   giving a genealogy of Jesus Christ; and in the third chapter of Luke there
   is also given a genealogy of Jesus Christ. Did these two agree, it would
   not prove the genealogy to be true, because it might nevertheless be a
   fabrication; but as they contradict each other in every particular, it
   proves falsehood absolutely. If Matthew speaks truth, Luke speaks
   falsehood; and if Luke speaks truth, Matthew speaks falsehood: and as
   there is no authority for believing one more than the other, there is no
   authority for believing either; and if they cannot be believed even in the
   very first thing they say, and set out to prove, they are not entitled to
   be believed in any thing they say afterwards. Truth is an uniform thing;
   and as to inspiration and revelation, were we to admit it, it is
   impossible to suppose it can be contradictory. Either then the men called
   apostles were imposters, or the books ascribed to them have been written
   by other persons, and fathered upon them, as is the case in the Old
   Testament.

   The book of Matthew gives (i. 6), a genealogy by name from David, up,
   through Joseph, the husband of Mary, to Christ; and makes there to be
   twent eight generations. The book of Luke gives also a genealogy by name
   from Christ, through Joseph the husband of Mary, down to David, and makes
   there to be forty-three generations; besides which, there is only the two
   names of David and Joseph that are alike in the two lists.--I here insert
   both genealogical lists, and for the sake of perspicuity and comparison,
   have placed them both in the same direction, that is, from Joseph down to
   David.

                                                 43 David                 





    [NOTE: * From the birth of David to the birth of Christ is upwards of
   1080 years; and as the life-time of Christ is not included, there are but
   27 full generations. To find therefore the average age of each person
   mentioned in the list, at the time his first son was born, it is only
   necessary to divide 1080 by 27, which gives 40 years for each person. As
   the life-time of man was then but of the same extent it is now, it is an
   absurdity to suppose, that 27 following generations should all be old
   bachelors, before they married; and the more so, when we are told that
   Solomon, the next in succession to David, had a house full of wives and
   mistresses before he was twenty-one years of age. So far from this
   genealogy being a solemn truth, it is not even a reasonable lie. The list
   of Luke gives about twenty-six years for the average age, and this is too
   much.--Author.]

   Now, if these men, Matthew and Luke, set out with a falsehood between them
   (as these two accounts show they do) in the very commencement of their
   history of Jesus Christ, and of who, and of what he was, what authority
   (as I have before asked) is there left for believing the strange things
   they tell us afterwards? If they cannot be believed in their account of
   his natural genealogy, how are we to believe them when they tell us he was
   the son of God, begotten by a ghost; and that an angel announced this in
   secret to his mother? If they lied in one genealogy, why are we to believe
   them in the other? If his natural genealogy be manufactured, which it
   certainly is, why are we not to suppose that his celestial genealogy is
   manufactured also, and that the whole is fabulous? Can any man of serious
   reflection hazard his future happiness upon the belief of a story
   naturally impossible, repugnant to every idea of decency, and related by
   persons already detected of falsehood? Is it not more safe that we stop
   ourselves at the plain, pure, and unmixed belief of one God, which is
   deism, than that we commit ourselves on an ocean of improbable,
   irrational, indecent, and contradictory tales?

   The first question, however, upon the books of the New Testament, as upon
   those of the Old, is, Are they genuine? were they written by the persons
   to whom they are ascribed? For it is upon this ground only that the
   strange things related therein have been credited. Upon this point, there
   is no direct proof for or against; and all that this state of a case
   proves is doubtfulness; and doubtfulness is the opposite of belief. The
   state, therefore, that the books are in, proves against themselves as far
   as this kind of proof can go.

   But, exclusive of this, the presumption is that the books called the
   Evangelists, and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were not
   written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and that they are impositions.
   The disordered state of the history in these four books, the silence of
   one book upon matters related in the other, and the disagreement that is
   to be found among them, implies that they are the productions of some
   unconnected individuals, many years after the things they pretend to
   relate, each of whom made his own legend; and not the writings of men
   living intimately together, as the men called apostles are supposed to
   have done: in fine, that they have been manufactured, as the books of the
   Old Testament have been, by other persons than those whose names they
   bear.

   The story of the angel announcing what the church calls the immaculate
   conception, is not so much as mentioned in the books ascribed to Mark, and
   John; and is differently related in Matthew and Luke. The former says the
   angel, appeared to Joseph; the latter says, it was to Mary; but either
   Joseph or Mary was the worst evidence that could have been thought of; for
   it was others that should have testified for them, and not they for
   themselves. Were any girl that is now with child to say, and even to swear
   it, that she was gotten with child by a ghost, and that an angel told her
   so, would she be believed? Certainly she would not. Why then are we to
   believe the same thing of another girl whom we never saw, told by nobody
   knows who, nor when, nor where? How strange and inconsistent is it, that
   the same circumstance that would weaken the belief even of a probable
   story, should be given as a motive for believing this one, that has upon
   the face of it every token of absolute impossibility and imposture.

   The story of Herod destroying all the children under two years old,
   belongs altogether to the book of Matthew; not one of the rest mentions
   anything about it. Had such a circumstance been true, the universality of
   it must have made it known to all the writers, and the thing would have
   been too striking to have been omitted by any. This writer tell us, that
   Jesus escaped this slaughter, because Joseph and Mary were warned by an
   angel to flee with him into Egypt; but he forgot to make provision for
   John [the Baptist], who was then under two years of age. John, however,
   who staid behind, fared as well as Jesus, who fled; and therefore the
   story circumstantially belies itself.

   Not any two of these writers agree in reciting, exactly in the same words,
   the written inscription, short as it is, which they tell us was put over
   Christ when he was crucified; and besides this, Mark says, He was
   crucified at the third hour, (nine in the morning;) and John says it was
   the sixth hour, (twelve at noon.) [According to John, (xix. 14) the
   sentence was not passed till about the sixth hour (noon,) and consequently
   the execution could not be till the afternoon; but Mark (xv. 25) Says
   expressly that he was crucified at the third hour, (nine in the
   moming,)--Author.]

   The inscription is thus stated in those books:

   Matthew--This is Jesus the king of the Jews.
   Mark--The king of the Jews.
   Luke--This is the king of the Jews.
   John--Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews.

   We may infer from these circumstances, trivial as they are, that those
   writers, whoever they were, and in whatever time they lived, were not
   present at the scene. The only one of the men called apostles who appears
   to have been near to the spot was Peter, and when he was accused of being
   one of Jesus's followers, it is said, (Matthew xxvi. 74,) "Then Peter
   began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man:" yet we are now
   called to believe the same Peter, convicted, by their own account, of
   perjury. For what reason, or on what authority, should we do this?

   The accounts that are given of the circumstances, that they tell us
   attended the crucifixion, are differently related in those four books.

   The book ascribed to Matthew says 'there was darkness over all the land
   from the sixth hour unto the ninth hour--that the veil of the temple was
   rent in twain from the top to the bottom--that there was an
   earthquake--that the rocks rent--that the graves opened, that the bodies
   of many of the saints that slept arose and came out of their graves after
   the resurrection, and went into the holy city and appeared unto many.'
   Such is the account which this dashing writer of the book of Matthew
   gives, but in which he is not supported by the writers of the other books.

   The writer of the book ascribed to Mark, in detailing the circumstances of
   the crucifixion, makes no mention of any earthquake, nor of the rocks
   rending, nor of the graves opening, nor of the dead men walking out. The
   writer of the book of Luke is silent also upon the same points. And as to
   the writer of the book of John, though he details all the circumstances of
   the crucifixion down to the burial of Christ, he says nothing about either
   the darkness--the veil of the temple--the earthquake--the rocks--the
   graves--nor the dead men.

   Now if it had been true that these things had happened, and if the writers
   of these books had lived at the time they did happen, and had been the
   persons they are said to be--namely, the four men called apostles,
   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,--it was not possible for them, as true
   historians, even without the aid of inspiration, not to have recorded
   them. The things, supposing them to have been facts, were of too much
   notoriety not to have been known, and of too much importance not to have
   been told. All these supposed apostles must have been witnesses of the
   earthquake, if there had been any, for it was not possible for them to
   have been absent from it: the opening of the graves and resurrection of
   the dead men, and their walking about the city, is of still greater
   importance than the earthquake. An earthquake is always possible, and
   natural, and proves nothing; but this opening of the graves is
   supernatural, and directly in point to their doctrine, their cause, and
   their apostleship. Had it been true, it would have filled up whole
   chapters of those books, and been the chosen theme and general chorus of
   all the writers; but instead of this, little and trivial things, and mere
   prattling conversation of 'he said this and she said that' are often
   tediously detailed, while this most important of all, had it been true, is
   passed off in a slovenly manner by a single dash of the pen, and that by
   one writer only, and not so much as hinted at by the rest.

   It is an easy thing to tell a lie, but it is difficult to support the lie
   after it is told. The writer of the book of Matthew should have told us
   who the saints were that came to life again, and went into the city, and
   what became of them afterwards, and who it was that saw them; for he is
   not hardy enough to say that he saw them himself;--whether they came out
   naked, and all in natural buff, he-saints and she-saints, or whether they
   came full dressed, and where they got their dresses; whether they went to
   their former habitations, and reclaimed their wives, their husbands, and
   their property, and how they were received; whether they entered
   ejectments for the recovery of their possessions, or brought actions of
   crim. con. against the rival interlopers; whether they remained on earth,
   and followed their former occupation of preaching or working; or whether
   they died again, or went back to their graves alive, and buried
   themselves.

   Strange indeed, that an army of saints should retum to life, and nobody
   know who they were, nor who it was that saw them, and that not a word more
   should be said upon the subject, nor these saints have any thing to tell
   us! Had it been the prophets who (as we are told) had formerly prophesied
   of these things, they must have had a great deal to say. They could have
   told us everything, and we should have had posthumous prophecies, with
   notes and commentaries upon the first, a little better at least than we
   have now. Had it been Moses, and Aaron, and Joshua, and Samuel, and David,
   not an unconverted Jew had remained in all Jerusalem. Had it been John the
   Baptist, and the saints of the times then present, everybody would have
   known them, and they would have out-preached and out-famed all the other
   apostles. But, instead of this, these saints are made to pop up, like
   Jonah's gourd in the night, for no purpose at all but to wither in the
   morning.--Thus much for this part of the story.

   The tale of the resurrection follows that of the crucifixion; and in this
   as well as in that, the writers, whoever they were, disagree so much as to
   make it evident that none of them were there.

   The book of Matthew states, that when Christ was put in the sepulchre the
   Jews applied to Pilate for a watch or a guard to be placed over the
   septilchre, to prevent the body being stolen by the disciples; and that in
   consequence of this request the sepulchre was made sure, sealing the stone
   that covered the mouth, and setting a watch. But the other books say
   nothing about this application, nor about the sealing, nor the guard, nor
   the watch; and according to their accounts, there were none. Matthew,
   however, follows up this part of the story of the guard or the watch with
   a second part, that I shall notice in the conclusion, as it serves to
   detect the fallacy of those books.

   The book of Matthew continues its account, and says, (xxviii. 1,) that at
   the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn, towards the first day of the
   week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. Mark
   says it was sun-rising, and John says it was dark. Luke says it was Mary
   Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women, that
   came to the sepulchre; and John states that Mary Magdalene came alone. So
   well do they agree about their first evidence! They all, however, appear
   to have known most about Mary Magdalene; she was a woman of large
   acquaintance, and it was not an ill conjecture that she might be upon the
   stroll. [The Bishop of Llandaff, in his famous "Apology," censured Paine
   severely for this insinuation against Mary Magdalene, but the censure
   really falls on our English version, which, by a chapter-heading (Luke
   vii.), has unwarrantably identified her as the sinful woman who anointed
   Jesus, and irrevocably branded her.--Editor.]

   The book of Matthew goes on to say (ver. 2): "And behold there was a great
   earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and
   rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it" But the other books
   say nothing about any earthquake, nor about the angel rolling back the
   stone, and sitting upon it and, according to their account, there was no
   angel sitting there. Mark says the angel [Mark says "a young man," and
   Luke "two men." --Editor.] was within the sepulchre, sitting on the right
   side. Luke says there were two, and they were both standing up; and John
   says they were both sitting down, one at the head and the other at the
   feet.

   Matthew says, that the angel that was sitting upon the stone on the
   outside of the sepulchre told the two Marys that Christ was risen, and
   that the women went away quickly. Mark says, that the women, upon seeing
   the stone rolled away, and wondering at it, went into the sepulchre, and
   that it was the angel that was sitting within on the right side, that told
   them so. Luke says, it was the two angels that were Standing up; and John
   says, it was Jesus Christ himself that told it to Mary Magdalene; and that
   she did not go into the sepulchre, but only stooped down and looked in.

   Now, if the writers of these four books had gone into a court of justice
   to prove an alibi, (for it is of the nature of an alibi that is here
   attempted to be proved, namely, the absence of a dead body by supernatural
   means,) and had they given their evidence in the same contradictory manner
   as it is here given, they would have been in danger of having their ears
   cropt for perjury, and would have justly deserved it. Yet this is the
   evidence, and these are the books, that have been imposed upon the world
   as being given by divine inspiration, and as the unchangeable word of God.

   The writer of the book of Matthew, after giving this account, relates a
   story that is not to be found in any of the other books, and which is the
   same I have just before alluded to. "Now," says he, [that is, after the
   conversation the women had had with the angel sitting upon the stone,]
   "behold some of the watch [meaning the watch that he had said had been
   placed over the sepulchre] came into the city, and shawed unto the chief
   priests all the things that were done; and when they were assembled with
   the elders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
   saying, Say ye, that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while
   we slept; and if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,
   and secure you. So they took the money, and did as they were taught; and
   this saying [that his disciples stole him away] is commonly reported among
   the Jews until this day."

   The expression, until this day, is an evidence that the book ascribed to
   Matthew was not written by Matthew, and that it has been manufactured long
   after the times and things of which it pretends to treat; for the
   expression implies a great length of intervening time. It would be
   inconsistent in us to speak in this manner of any thing happening in our
   own time. To give, therefore, intelligible meaning to the expression, we
   must suppose a lapse of some generations at least, for this manner of
   speaking carries the mind back to ancient time.

   The absurdity also of the story is worth noticing; for it shows the writer
   of the book of Matthew to have been an exceeding weak and foolish man. He
   tells a story that contradicts itself in point of possibility; for though
   the guard, if there were any, might be made to say that the body was taken
   away while they were asleep, and to give that as a reason for their not
   having prevented it, that same sleep must also have prevented their
   knowing how, and by whom, it was done; and yet they are made to say that
   it was the disciples who did it. Were a man to tender his evidence of
   something that he should say was done, and of the manner of doing it, and
   of the person who did it, while he was asleep, and could know nothing of
   the matter, such evidence could not be received: it will do well enough
   for Testament evidence, but not for any thing where truth is concerned.

   I come now to that part of the evidence in those books, that respects the
   pretended appearance of Christ after this pretended resurrection.

   The writer of the book of Matthew relates, that the angel that was sitting
   on the stone at the mouth of the sepulchre, said to the two Marys (xxviii.
   7), "Behold Christ is gone before you into Galilee, there ye shall see
   him; lo, I have told you." And the same writer at the next two verses (8,
   9,) makes Christ himself to speak to the same purpose to these women
   immediately after the angel had told it to them, and that they ran quickly
   to tell it to the disciples; and it is said (ver. 16), "Then the eleven
   disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had
   appointed them; and, when they saw him, they worshipped him."

   But the writer of the book of John tells us a story very different to
   this; for he says (xx. 19) "Then the same day at evening, being the first
   day of the week, [that is, the same day that Christ is said to have
   risen,] when the doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled, for
   fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst of them."

   According to Matthew the eleven were marching to Galilee, to meet Jesus in
   a mountain, by his own appointment, at the very time when, according to
   John, they were assembled in another place, and that not by appointment,
   but in secret, for fear of the Jews.

   The writer of the book of Luke xxiv. 13, 33-36, contradicts that of
   Matthew more pointedly than John does; for he says expressly, that the
   meeting was in Jerusalem the evening of the same day that he (Christ)
   rose, and that the eleven were there.

   Now, it is not possible, unless we admit these supposed disciples the
   right of wilful lying, that the writers of these books could be any of the
   eleven persons called disciples; for if, according to Matthew, the eleven
   went into Galilee to meet Jesus in a mountain by his own appointment, on
   the same day that he is said to have risen, Luke and John must have been
   two of that eleven; yet the writer of Luke says expressly, and John
   implies as much, that the meeting was that same day, in a house in
   Jerusalem; and, on the other hand, if, according to Luke and John, the
   eleven were assembled in a house in Jerusalem, Matthew must have been one
   of that eleven; yet Matthew says the meeting was in a mountain in Galilee,
   and consequently the evidence given in those books destroy each other.

   The writer of the book of Mark says nothing about any meeting in Galilee;
   but he says (xvi. 12) that Christ, after his resurrection, appeared in
   another form to two of them, as they walked into the country, and that
   these two told it to the residue, who would not believe them. [This
   belongs to the late addition to Mark, which originally ended with xvi.
   8.--Editor.] Luke also tells a story, in which he keeps Christ employed
   the whole of the day of this pretended resurrection, until the evening,
   and which totally invalidates the account of going to the mountain in
   Galilee. He says, that two of them, without saying which two, went that
   same day to a village called Emmaus, three score furlongs (seven miles and
   a half) from Jerusalem, and that Christ in disguise went with them, and
   stayed with them unto the evening, and supped with them, and then vanished
   out of their sight, and reappeared that same evening, at the meeting of
   the eleven in Jerusalem.

   This is the contradictory manner in which the evidence of this pretended
   reappearance of Christ is stated: the only point in which the writers
   agree, is the skulking privacy of that reappearance; for whether it was in
   the recess of a mountain in Galilee, or in a shut-up house in Jerusalem,
   it was still skulking. To what cause then are we to assign this skulking?
   On the one hand, it is directly repugnant to the supposed or pretended
   end, that of convincing the world that Christ was risen; and, on the other
   hand, to have asserted the publicity of it would have exposed the writers
   of those books to public detection; and, therefore, they have been under
   the necessity of making it a private affair.

   As to the account of Christ being seen by more than five hundred at once,
   it is Paul only who says it, and not the five hundred who say it for
   themselves. It is, therefore, the testimony of but one man, and that too
   of a man, who did not, according to the same account, believe a word of
   the matter himself at the time it is said to have happened. His evidence,
   supposing him to have been the writer of Corinthians xv., where this
   account is given, is like that of a man who comes into a court of justice
   to swear that what he had sworn before was false. A man may often see
   reason, and he has too always the right of changing his opinion; but this
   liberty does not extend to matters of fact.

   I now come to the last scene, that of the ascension into heaven.--Here all
   fear of the Jews, and of every thing else, must necessarily have been out
   of the question: it was that which, if true, was to seal the whole; and
   upon which the reality of the future mission of the disciples was to rest
   for proof. Words, whether declarations or promises, that passed in
   private, either in the recess of a mountain in Galilee, or in a shut-up
   house in Jerusalem, even supposing them to have been spoken, could not be
   evidence in public; it was therefore necessary that this last scene should
   preclude the possibility of denial and dispute; and that it should be, as
   I have stated in the former part of 'The Age of Reason,' as public and as
   visible as the sun at noon-day; at least it ought to have been as public
   as the crucifixion is reported to have been.--But to come to the point.

   In the first place, the writer of the book of Matthew does not say a
   syllable about it; neither does the writer of the book of John. This being
   the case, is it possible to suppose that those writers, who affect to be
   even minute in other matters, would have been silent upon this, had it
   been true? The writer of the book of Mark passes it off in a careless,
   slovenly manner, with a single dash of the pen, as if he was tired of
   romancing, or ashamed of the story. So also does the writer of Luke. And
   even between these two, there is not an apparent agreement, as to the
   place where this final parting is said to have been. [The last nine verses
   of Mark being ungenuine, the story of the ascension rests exclusively on
   the words in Luke xxiv. 51, "was carried up into heaven," -words omitted
   by several ancient authorities.--Editor.]

   The book of Mark says that Christ appeared to the eleven as they sat at
   meat, alluding to the meeting of the eleven at Jerusalem: he then states
   the conversation that he says passed at that meeting; and immediately
   after says (as a school-boy would finish a dull story,) "So then, after
   the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on
   the right hand of God." But the writer of Luke says, that the ascension
   was from Bethany; that he (Christ) led them out as far as Bethany, and was
   fiarted from them there, and was carried up into heaven. So also was
   Mahomet: and, as to Moses, the apostle Jude says, ver. 9. That 'Michael
   and the devil disputed about his body.' While we believe such fables as
   these, or either of them, we believe unworthily of the Almighty.

   I have now gone through the examination of the four books ascribed to
   Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; and when it is considered that the whole
   space of time, from the crucifixion to what is called the ascension, is
   but a few days, apparently not more than three or four, and that all the
   circumstances are reported to have happened nearly about the same spot,
   Jerusalem, it is, I believe, impossible to find in any story upon record
   so many and such glaring absurdities, contradictions, and falsehoods, as
   are in those books. They are more numerous and striking than I had any
   expectation of finding, when I began this examination, and far more so
   than I had any idea of when I wrote the former part of 'The Age of
   Reason.' I had then neither Bible nor Testament to refer to, nor could I
   procure any. My own situation, even as to existence, was becoming every
   day more precarious; and as I was willing to leave something behind me
   upon the subject, I was obliged to be quick and concise. The quotations I
   then made were from memory only, but they are correct; and the opinions I
   have advanced in that work are the effect of the most clear and
   long-established conviction,--that the Bible and the Testament are
   impositions upon the world;--that the fall of man, the account of Jesus
   Christ being the Son of God, and of his dying to appease the wrath of God,
   and of salvation by that strange means, are all fabulous inventions,
   dishonourable to the wisdom and power of the Almighty;--that the only true
   religion is deism, by which I then meant and now mean the belief of one
   God, and an imitation of his moral character, or the practice of what are
   called moral virtues;--and that it was upon this only (so far as religion
   is concerned) that I rested all my hopes of happiness hereafter. So say I
   now--and so help me God.

   But to retum to the subject.--Though it is impossible, at this distance of
   time, to ascertain as a fact who were the writers of those four books (and
   this alone is sufficient to hold them in doubt, and where we doubt we do
   not believe) it is not difficult to ascertain negatively that they were
   not written by the persons to whom they are ascribed. The contradictions
   in those books demonstrate two things:

   First, that the writers cannot have been eye-witnesses and ear-witnesses
   of the matters they relate, or they would have related them without those
   contradictions; and, consequently that the books have not been written by
   the persons called apostles, who are supposed to have been witnesses of
   this kind.

   Secondly, that the writers, whoever they were, have not acted in concerted
   imposition, but each writer separately and individually for himself, and
   without the knowledge of the other.

   The same evidence that applies to prove the one, applies equally to prove
   both cases; that is, that the books were not written by the men called
   apostles, and also that they are not a concerted imposition. As to
   inspiration, it is altogether out of the question; we may as well attempt
   to unite truth and falsehood, as inspiration and contradiction.

   If four men are eye-witnesses and ear-witnesses to a scene, they will
   without any concert between them, agree as to time and place, when and
   where that scene happened. Their individual knowledge of the thing, each
   one knowing it for himself, renders concert totally unnecessary; the one
   will not say it was in a mountain in the country, and the other at a house
   in town; the one will not say it was at sunrise, and the other that it was
   dark. For in whatever place it was and whatever time it was, they know it
   equally alike.

   And on the other hand, if four men concert a story, they will make their
   separate relations of that story agree and corroborate with each other to
   support the whole. That concert supplies the want of fact in the one case,
   as the knowledge of the fact supersedes, in the other case, the necessity
   of a concert. The same contradictions, therefore, that prove there has
   been no concert, prove also that the reporters had no knowledge of the
   fact, (or rather of that which they relate as a fact,) and detect also the
   falsehood of their reports. Those books, therefore, have neither been
   written by the men called apostles, nor by imposters in concert.--How then
   have they been written?

   I am not one of those who are fond of believing there is much of that
   which is called wilful lying, or lying originally, except in the case of
   men setting up to be prophets, as in the Old Testament; for prophesying is
   lying professionally. In almost all other cases it is not difficult to
   discover the progress by which even simple supposition, with the aid of
   credulity, will in time grow into a lie, and at last be told as a fact;
   and whenever we can find a charitable reason for a thing of this kind, we
   ought not to indulge a severe one.

   The story of Jesus Christ appearing after he was dead is the story of an
   apparition, such as timid imaginations can always create in vision, and
   credulity believe. Stories of this kind had been told of the assassination
   of Julius Caesar not many years before, and they generally have their
   origin in violent deaths, or in execution of innocent persons. In cases of
   this kind, compassion lends its aid, and benevolently stretches the story.
   It goes on a little and a little farther, till it becomes a most certain
   truth. Once start a ghost, and credulity fills up the history of its life,
   and assigns the cause of its appearance; one tells it one way, another
   another way, till there are as many stories about the ghost, and about the
   proprietor of the ghost, as there are about Jesus Christ in these four
   books.

   The story of the appearance of Jesus Christ is told with that strange
   mixture of the natural and impossible, that distinguishes legendary tale
   from fact. He is represented as suddenly coming in and going out when the
   doors are shut, and of vanishing out of sight, and appearing again, as one
   would conceive of an unsubstantial vision; then again he is hungry, sits
   down to meat, and eats his supper. But as those who tell stories of this
   kind never provide for all the cases, so it is here: they have told us,
   that when he arose he left his grave-clothes behind him; but they have
   forgotten to provide other clothes for him to appear in afterwards, or to
   tell us what be did with them when he ascended; whether he stripped all
   off, or went up clothes and all. In the case of Elijah, they have been
   careful enough to make. him throw down his mantle; how it happened not to
   be burnt in the chariot of fire, they also have not told us; but as
   imagination supplies all deficiencies of this kind, we may suppose if we
   please that it was made of salamander's wool.

   Those who are not much acquainted with ecclesiastical history, may suppose
   that the book called the New Testament has existed ever since the time of
   Jesus Christ, as they suppose that the books ascribed to Moses have
   existed ever since the time of Moses. But the fact is historically
   otherwise; there was no such book as the New Testament till more than
   three hundred years after the time that Christ is said to have lived.

   At what time the books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, began to
   appear, is altogether a matter of uncertainty. There is not the least
   shadow of evidence of who the persons were that wrote them, nor at what
   time they were written; and they might as well have been called by the
   names of any of the other supposed apostles as by the names they are now
   called. The originals are not in the possession of any Christian Church
   existing, any more than the two tables of stone written on, they pretend,
   by the finger of God, upon Mount Sinai, and given to Moses, are in the
   possession of the Jews. And even if they were, there is no possibility of
   proving the hand-writing in either case. At the time those four books were
   written there was no printing, and consequently there could be no
   publication otherwise than by written copies, which any man might make or
   alter at pleasure, and call them originals. Can we suppose it is
   consistent with the wisdom of the Almighty to commit himself and his will
   to man upon such precarious means as these; or that it is consistent we
   should pin our faith upon such uncertainties? We cannot make nor alter,
   nor even imitate, so much as one blade of grass that he has made, and yet
   we can make or alter words of God as easily as words of man. [The former
   part of the 'Age of Reason' has not been published two years, and there is
   already an expression in it that is not mine. The expression is: The book
   of Luke was carried by a majority of one voice only. It may be true, but
   it is not I that have said it. Some person who might know of that
   circumstance, has added it in a note at the bottom of the page of some of
   the editions, printed either in England or in America; and the printers,
   after that, have erected it into the body of the work, and made me the
   author of it. If this has happened within such a short space of time,
   notwithstanding the aid of printing, which prevents the alteration of
   copies individually, what may not have happened in a much greater length
   of time, when there was no printing, and when any man who could write
   could make a written copy and call it an original by Matthew, Mark, Luke,
   or John? --Author.

   [The spurious addition to Paine's work alluded to in his footnote drew on
   him a severe criticism from Dr. Priestley ("Letters to a Philosophical
   Unbeliever," p. 75), yet it seems to have been Priestley himself who, in
   his quotation, first incorporated into Paine's text the footnote added by
   the editor of the American edition (1794). The American added: "Vide
   Moshiem's (sic) Ecc. History," which Priestley omits. In a modern American
   edition I notice four verbal alterations introduced into the above
   footnote.--Editor.]

   About three hundred and fifty years after the time that Christ is said to
   have lived, several writings of the kind I am speaking of were scattered
   in the hands of divers individuals; and as the church had begun to form
   itself into an hierarchy, or church government, with temporal powers, it
   set itself about collecting them into a code, as we now see them, called
   'The New Testament.' They decided by vote, as I have before said in the
   former part of the Age of Reason, which of those writings, out of the
   collection they had made, should be the word of God, and which should not.
   The Robbins of the Jews had decided, by vote, upon the books of the Bible
   before.

   As the object of the church, as is the case in all national establishments
   of churches, was power and revenue, and terror the means it used, it is
   consistent to suppose that the most miraculous and wonderful of the
   writings they had collected stood the best chance of being voted. And as
   to the authenticity of the books, the vote stands in the place of it; for
   it can be traced no higher.

   Disputes, however, ran high among the people then calling themselves
   Christians, not only as to points of doctrine, but as to the authenticity
   of the books. In the contest between the person called St. Augustine, and
   Fauste, about the year 400, the latter says, "The books called the
   Evangelists have been composed long after the times of the apostles, by
   some obscure men, who, fearing that the world would not give credit to
   their relation of matters of which they could not be informed, have
   published them under the names of the apostles; and which are so full of
   sottishness and discordant relations, that there is neither agreement nor
   connection between them."

   And in another place, addressing himself to the advocates of those books,
   as being the word of God, he says, "It is thus that your predecessors have
   inserted in the scriptures of our Lord many things which, though they
   carry his name, agree not with his doctrine. This is not surprising, since
   that we have often proved that these things have not been written by
   himself, nor by his apostles, but that for the greatest part they are
   founded upon tales, upon vague reports, and put together by I know not
   what half Jews, with but little agreement between them; and which they
   have nevertheless published under the name of the apostles of our Lord,
   and have thus attributed to them their own errers and their lies. [I have
   taken these two extracts from Boulanger's Life of Paul, written in French;
   Boulanger has quoted them from the writings of Augustine against Fauste,
   to which he refers.--Author.

   [This Bishop Faustus is usualy styled "The Manichaeum," Augustine having
   entitled his book, Contra Fsustum Manichaeum Libri xxxiii., in which
   nearly the whole of Faustus' very able work is quoted.--Editor.]

   The reader will see by those extracts that the authenticity of the books
   of the New Testament was denied, and the books treated as tales,
   forgeries, and lies, at the time they were voted to be the word of God.
   But the interest of the church, with the assistance of the faggot, bore
   down the opposition, and at last suppressed all investigation. Miracles
   followed upon miracles, if we will believe them, and men were taught to
   say they believed whether they believed or not. But (by way of throwing in
   a thought) the French Revolution has excommunicated the church from the
   power of working miracles; she has not been able, with the assistance of
   all her saints, to work one miracle since the revolution began; and as she
   never stood in greater need than now, we may, without the aid of
   divination, conclude that all her former miracles are tricks and lies.
   [Boulanger in his life of Paul, has collected from the ecclesiastical
   histories, and the writings of the fathers as they are called, several
   matters which show the opinions that prevailed among the different sects
   of Christians, at the time the Testament, as we now see it, was voted to
   be the word of God. The following extracts are from the second chapter of
   that work:

   The Marcionists (a Christian sect) asserted that the evangelists were
   filled with falsities. The Manichaeans, who formed a very numerous sect at
   the commencement of Christianity, rejected as false all the New Testament,
   and showed other writings quite different that they gave for authentic.
   The Cerinthians, like the Marcionists, admitted not the Acts of the
   Apostles. The Encratites and the Sevenians adopted neither the Acts, nor
   the Epistles of Paul. Chrysostom, in a bomily which he made upon the Acts
   of the Apostles, says that in his time, about the year 400, many people
   knew nothing either of the author or of the book. St. Irene, who lived
   before that time, reports that the Valentinians, like several other sects
   of the Christians, accused the scriptures of being filled with
   imperfections, errors, and contradictions. The Ebionites, or Nazarenes,
   who were the first Christians, rejected all the Epistles of Paul, and
   regarded him as an impostor. They report, among other things, that he was
   originally a Pagan; that he came to Jerusalem, where he lived some time;
   and that having a mind to marry the daughter of the high priest, he had
   himself been circumcised; but that not being able to obtain her, he
   quarrelled with the Jews and wrote against circumcision, and against the
   observation of the Sabbath, and against all the legal ordinances.--Author.
   [Much abridged from the Exam. Crit. de la Vie de St. Paul, by N.A.
   Boulanger, 1770.--Editor.]

   When we consider the lapse of more than three hundred years intervening
   between the time that Christ is said to have lived and the time the New
   Testament was formed into a book, we must see, even without the assistance
   of historical evidence, the exceeding uncertainty there is of its
   authenticity. The authenticity of the book of Homer, so far as regards the
   authorship, is much better established than that of the New Testament,
   though Homer is a thousand years the most ancient. It was only an
   exceeding good poet that could have written the book of Homer, and,
   therefore, few men only could have attempted it; and a man capable of
   doing it would not have thrown away his own fame by giving it to another.
   In like manner, there were but few that could have composed Euclid's
   Elements, because none but an exceeding good geometrician could have been
   the author of that work.

   But with respect to the books of the New Testament, particularly such
   parts as tell us of the resurrection and ascension of Christ, any person
   who could tell a story of an apparition, or of a man's walking, could have
   made such books; for the story is most wretchedly told. The chance,
   therefore, of forgery in the Testament is millions to one greater than in
   the case of Homer or Euclid. Of the numerous priests or parsons of the
   present day, bishops and all, every one of them can make a sermon, or
   translate a scrap of Latin, especially if it has been translated a
   thousand times before; but is there any amongst them that can write poetry
   like Homer, or science like Euclid? The sum total of a parson's learning,
   with very few exceptions, is a, b, ab, and hic, haec, hoc; and their
   knowledge of science is, three times one is three; and this is more than
   sufficient to have enabled them, had they lived at the time, to have
   written all the books of the New Testament.

   As the opportunities of forgery were greater, so also was the inducement.
   A man could gain no advantage by writing under the name of Homer or
   Euclid; if he could write equal to them, it would be better that he wrote
   under his own name; if inferior, he could not succeed. Pride would prevent
   the former, and impossibility the latter. But with respect to such books
   as compose the New Testament, all the inducements were on the side of
   forgery. The best imagined history that could have been made, at the
   distance of two or three hundred years after the time, could not have
   passed for an original under the name of the real writer; the only chance
   of success lay in forgery; for the church wanted pretence for its new
   doctrine, and truth and talents were out of the question.

   But as it is not uncommon (as before observed) to relate stories of
   persons walking after they are dead, and of ghosts and apparitions of such
   as have fallen by some violent or extraordinary means; and as the people
   of that day were in the habit of believing such things, and of the
   appearance of angels, and also of devils, and of their getting into
   people's insides, and skaking them like a fit of an ague, and of their
   being cast out again as if by an emetic--(Mary Magdalene, the book of Mark
   tells us had brought up, or been brought to bed of seven devils;) it was
   nothing extraordinary that some story of this kind should get abroad of
   the person called Jesus Christ, and become afterwards the foundation of
   the four books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each writer told
   a tale as he heard it, or thereabouts, and gave to his book the name of
   the saint or the apostle whom tradition had given as the eye-witness. It
   is only upon this ground that the contradictions in those books can be
   acounted for; and if this be not the case, they are downright impositions,
   lies, and forgeries, without even the apology of credulity.

   That they have been written by a sort of half Jews, as the foregoing
   quotations mention, is discernible enough. The frequent references made to
   that chief assassin and impostor Moses, and to the men called prophets,
   establishes this point; and, on the other hand, the church has
   complimented the fraud, by admitting the Bible and the Testament to reply
   to each other. Between the Christian-Jew and the Christian-Gentile, the
   thing called a prophecy, and the thing prophesied of, the type and the
   thing typified, the sign and the thing signified, have been industriously
   rummaged up, and fitted together like old locks and pick-lock keys. The
   story foolishly enough told of Eve and the serpent, and naturally enough
   as to the enmity between men and serpents (for the serpent always bites
   about the heel, because it cannot reach higher, and the man always knocks
   the serpent about the head, as the most effectual way to prevent its
   biting;) ["It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Gen.
   iii. 15.--Author.] this foolish story, I say, has been made into a
   prophecy, a type, and a promise to begin with; and the lying imposition of
   Isaiah to Ahaz, 'That a virgin shall conceive and bear a son,' as a sign
   that Ahaz should conquer, when the event was that he was defeated (as
   already noticed in the observations on the book of Isaiah), has been
   perverted, and made to serve as a winder up.

   Jonah and the whale are also made into a sign and type. Jonah is Jesus,
   and the whale is the grave; for it is said, (and they have made Christ to
   say it of himself, Matt. xii. 40), "For as Jonah was three days and three
   nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and
   three nighis in the heart of the earth." But it happens, aukwardly enough,
   that Christ, according to their own account, was but one day and two
   nights in the grave; about 36 hours instead of 72; that is, the Friday
   night, the Saturday, and the Saturday night; for they say he was up on the
   Sunday morning by sunrise, or before. But as this fits quite as well as
   the bite and the kick in Genesis, or the virgin and her son in Isaiah, it
   will pass in the lump of orthodox things.--Thus much for the historical
   part of the Testament and its evidences.

   Epistles of Paul--The epistles ascribed to Paul, being fourteen in number,
   almost fill up the remaining part of the Testament. Whether those epistles
   were written by the person to whom they are ascribed is a matter of no
   great importance, since that the writer, whoever he was, attempts to prove
   his doctrine by argument. He does not pretend to have been witness to any
   of the scenes told of the resurrection and the ascension; and he declares
   that he had not believed them.

   The story of his being struck to the ground as he was journeying to
   Damascus, has nothing in it miraculous or extraordinary; he escaped with
   life, and that is more than many others have done, who have been struck
   with lightning; and that he should lose his sight for three days, and be
   unable to eat or drink during that time, is nothing more than is common in
   such conditions. His companions that were with him appear not to have
   suffered in the same manner, for they were well enough to lead him the
   remainder of the journey; neither did they pretend to have seen any
   vision.

   The character of the person called Paul, according to the accounts given
   of him, has in it a great deal of violence and fanaticism; he had
   persecuted with as much heat as he preached afterwards; the stroke he had
   received had changed his thinking, without altering his constitution; and
   either as a Jew or a Christian he was the same zealot. Such men are never
   good moral evidences of any doctrine they preach. They are always in
   extremes, as well of action as of belief.

   The doctrine he sets out to prove by argument, is the resurrection of the
   same body: and he advances this as an evidence of immortality. But so much
   will men differ in their manner of thinking, and in the conclusions they
   draw from the same premises, that this doctrine of the resurrection of the
   same body, so far from being an evidence of immortality, appears to me to
   be an evidence againt it; for if I have already died in this body, and am
   raised again in the same body in which I have died, it is presumptive
   evidence that I shall die again. That resurrection no more secures me
   against the repetition of dying, than an ague-fit, when past, secures me
   against another. To believe therefore in immortality, I must have a more
   elevated idea than is contained in the gloomy doctrine of the
   resurrection.

   Besides, as a matter of choice, as well as of hope, I had rather have a
   better body and a more convenient form than the present. Every animal in
   the creation excels us in something. The winged insects, without
   mentioning doves or eagles, can pass over more space with greater ease in
   a few minutes than man can in an hour. The glide of the smallest fish, in
   proportion to its bulk, exceeds us in motion almost beyond comparison, and
   without weariness. Even the sluggish snail can ascend from the bottom of a
   dungeon, where man, by the want of that ability, would perish; and a
   spider can launch itself from the top, as a playful amusement. The
   personal powers of man are so limited, and his heavy frame so little
   constructed to extensive enjoyment, that there is nothing to induce us to
   wish the opinion of Paul to be true. It is too little for the magnitude of
   the scene, too mean for the sublimity of the subject.

   But all other arguments apart, the consciousness of existence is the only
   conceivable idea we can have of another life, and the continuance of that
   consciousness is immortality. The consciousness of existence, or the
   knowing that we exist, is not necessarily confined to the same form, nor
   to the same matter, even in this life.

   We have not in all cases the same form, nor in any case the same matter,
   that composed our bodies twenty or thirty years ago; and yet we are
   conscious of being the same persons. Even legs and arms, which make up
   almost half the human frame, are not necessary to the consciousness of
   existence. These may be lost or taken away and the full consciousness of
   existence remain; and were their place supplied by wings, or other
   appendages, we cannot conceive that it could alter our consciousness of
   existence. In short, we know not how much, or rather how little, of our
   composition it is, and how exquisitely fine that little is, that creates
   in us this consciousness of existence; and all beyond that is like the
   pulp of a peach, distinct and separate from the vegetative speck in the
   kernel.

   Who can say by what exceeding fine action of fine matter it is that a
   thought is produced in what we call the mind? and yet that thought when
   produced, as I now produce the thought I am writing, is capable of
   becoming immortal, and is the only production of man that has that
   capacity.

   Statues of brass and marble will perish; and statues made in imitation of
   them are not the same statues, nor the same workmanship, any more than the
   copy of a picture is the same picture. But print and reprint a thought a
   thousand times over, and that with materials of any kind, carve it in
   wood, or engrave it on stone, the thought is eternally and identically the
   same thought in every case. It has a capacity of unimpaired existence,
   unaffected by change of matter, and is essentially distinct, and of a
   nature different from every thing else that we know of, or can conceive.
   If then the thing produced has in itself a capacity of being immortal, it
   is more than a token that the power that produced it, which is the
   self-same thing as consciousness of existence, can be immortal also; and
   that as independently of the matter it was first connected with, as the
   thought is of the printing or writing it first appeared in. The one idea
   is not more difficult to believe than the other; and we can see that one
   is true.

   That the consciousness of existence is not dependent on the same form or
   the same matter, is demonstrated to our senses in the works of the
   creation, as far as our senses are capable of receiving that
   demonstration. A very numerous part of the animal creation preaches to us,
   far better than Paul, the belief of a life hereafter. Their little life
   resembles an earth and a heaven, a present and a future state; and
   comprises, if it may be so expressed, immortality in miniature.

   The most beautiful parts of the creation to our eye are the winged
   insects, and they are not so originally. They acquire that form and that
   inimitable brilliancy by progressive changes. The slow and creeping
   caterpillar worm of to day, passes in a few days to a torpid figure, and a
   state resembling death; and in the next change comes forth in all the
   miniature magnificence of life, a splendid butterfly. No resemblance of
   the former creature remains; every thing is changed; all his powers are
   new, and life is to him another thing. We cannot conceive that the
   consciousness of existence is not the same in this state of the animal as
   before; why then must I believe that the resurrection of the same body is
   necessary to continue to me the consciousness of existence hereafter?

   In the former part of 'The Agee o,f Reason.' I have called the creation
   the true and only real word of God; and this instance, or this text, in
   the book of creation, not only shows to us that this thing may be so, but
   that it is so; and that the belief of a future state is a rational belief,
   founded upon facts visible in the creation: for it is not more difficult
   to believe that we shall exist hereafter in a better state and form than
   at present, than that a worm should become a butterfly, and quit the
   dunghill for the atmosphere, if we did not know it as a fact.

   As to the doubtful jargon ascribed to Paul in 1 Corinthians xv., which
   makes part of the burial service of some Christian sectaries, it is as
   destitute of meaning as the tolling of a bell at the funeral; it explains
   nothing to the understanding, it illustrates nothing to the imagination,
   but leaves the reader to find any meaning if he can. "All flesh," says he,
   "is not the same flesh. There is one flesh of men, another of beasts,
   another of fishes, and another of birds." And what then? nothing. A cook
   could have said as much. "There are also," says he, "bodies celestial and
   bodies terrestrial; the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the
   terrestrial is the other." And what then? nothing. And what is the
   difference? nothing that he has told. "There is," says he, "one glory of
   the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars."
   And what then? nothing; except that he says that one star differlth from
   another star in glory, instead of distance; and he might as well have told
   us that the moon did not shine so bright as the sun. All this is nothing
   better than the jargon of a conjuror, who picks up phrases he does not
   understand to confound the credulous people who come to have their fortune
   told. Priests and conjurors are of the same trade.

   Sometimes Paul affects to be a naturalist, and to prove his system of
   resurrection from the principles of vegetation. "Thou fool" says he, "that
   which thou sowest is not quickened except it die." To which one might
   reply in his own language, and say, Thou fool, Paul, that which thou
   sowest is not quickened except it die not; for the grain that dies in the
   ground never does, nor can vegetate. It is only the living grains that
   produce the next crop. But the metaphor, in any point of view, is no
   simile. It is succession, and [not] resurrection.

   The progress of an animal from one state of being to another, as from a
   worm to a butterfly, applies to the case; but this of a grain does not,
   and shows Paul to have been what he says of others, a fool.

   Whether the fourteen epistles ascribed to Paul were written by him or not,
   is a matter of indifference; they are either argumentative or dogmatical;
   and as the argument is defective, and the dogmatical part is merely
   presumptive, it signifies not who wrote them. And the same may be said for
   the remaining parts of the Testament. It is not upon the Epistles, but
   upon what is called the Gospel, contained in the four books ascribed to
   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and upon the pretended prophecies, that the
   theory of the church, calling itself the Christian Church, is founded. The
   Epistles are dependant upon those, and must follow their fate; for if the
   story of Jesus Chiist be fabulous, all reasoning founded upon it, as a
   supposed truth, must fall with it.

   We know from history, that one of the principal leaders of this church,
   Athanasius, lived at the time the New Testament was formed; [Athanasius
   died, according to the Church chronology, in the year 371--Auther.] and we
   know also, from the absurd jargon he has left us under the name of a
   creed, the character of the men who formed the New Testament; and we know
   also from the same history that the authenticity of the books of which it
   is composed was denied at the time. It was upon the vote of such as
   Athanasius that the Testament was decreed to be the word of God; and
   nothing can present to us a more strange idea than that of decreeing the
   word of God by vote. Those who rest their faith upon such authority put
   man in the place of God, and have no true foundation for future happiness.
   Credulity, however, is not a crime, but it becomes criminal by resisting
   conviction. It is strangling in the womb of the conscience the efforts it
   makes to ascertain truth. We should never force belief upon ourselves in
   any thing.

   I here close the subject on the Old Testament and the New. The evidence I
   have produced to prove them forgeries, is extracted from the books
   themselves, and acts, like a two-edge sword, either way. If the evidence
   be denied, the authenticity of the Scriptures is denied with it, for it is
   Scripture evidence: and if the evidence be admitted, the authenticity of
   the books is disproved. The contradictory impossibilities, contained in
   the Old Testament and the New, put them in the case of a man who swears
   for and against. Either evidence convicts him of perjury, and equally
   destroys reputation.

   Should the Bible and the Testament hereafter fall, it is not that I have
   done it. I have done no more than extracted the evidence from the confused
   mass of matters with which it is mixed, and arranged that evidence in a
   point of light to be clearly seen and easily comprehended; and, having
   done this, I leave the reader to judge for himself, as I have judged for
   myself.

   CHAPTER III - CONCLUSION

   IN the former part of 'The Age of Reason' I have spoken of the three
   frauds, mystery, miracle, and.Prophecy; and as I have seen nothing in any
   of the answers to that work that in the least affects what I have there
   said upon those subjects, I shall not encumber this Second Part with
   additions that are not necessary.

   I have spoken also in the same work upon what is celled revelation, and
   have shown the absurd misapplication of that term to the books of the Old
   Testament and the New; for certainly revelation is out of the question in
   reciting any thing of which man has been the actor or the witness. That
   which man has done or seen, needs no revelation to tell him he has done
   it, or seen it --for he knows it already--nor to enable him to tell it or
   to write it. It is ignorance, or imposition, to apply the term revelation
   in such cases; yet the Bible and Testament are classed under this
   fraudulent description of being all revelation.

   Revelation then, so far as the term has relation between God and man, can
   only be applied to something which God reveals of his will to man; but
   though the power of the Almighty to make such a communication is
   necessarily admitted, because to that power all things are possible, yet,
   the thing so revealed (if any thing ever was revealed, and which, by the
   bye, it is impossible to prove) is revelation to the person only to whom
   it is made. His account of it to another is not revelation; and whoever
   puts faith in that account, puts it in the man from whom the account
   comes; and that man may have been deceived, or may have dreamed it; or he
   may be an impostor and may lie. There is no possible criterion whereby to
   judge of the truth of what he tells; for even the morality of it would be
   no proof of revelation. In all such cases, the proper answer should be,
   "When it is revealed to me, I will believe it to be revelation; but it is
   not and cannot be incumbent upon me to believe it to be revelation before;
   neither is it proper that I should take the word of man as the word of
   God, and put man in the place of God." This is the manner in which I have
   spoken of revelation in the former part of The Age of Reason; and which,
   whilst it reverentially admits revelation as a possible thing, because, as
   before said, to the Almighty all things are possible, it prevents the
   imposition of one man upon another, and precludes the wicked use of
   pretended revelation.

   But though, speaking for myself, I thus admit the possibility of
   revelation, I totally disbelieve that the Almighty ever did communicate
   any thing to man, by any mode of speech, in any language, or by any kind
   of vision, or appearance, or by any means which our senses are capable of
   receiving, otherwise than by the universal display of himself in the works
   of the creation, and by that repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad
   actions, and disposition to good ones. [A fair parallel of the then
   unknown aphorism of Kant: "Two things fill the soul with wonder and
   reverence, increasing evermore as I meditate more closely upon them: the
   starry heavens above me and the moral law within me." (Kritik
   derpraktischen Vernunfe, 1788). Kant's religious utterances at the
   beginning of the French Revolution brought on him a royal mandate of
   silence, because he had worked out from "the moral law within" a principle
   of human equality precisely similar to that which Paine had derived from
   his Quaker doctrine of the "inner light" of every man. About the same time
   Paine's writings were suppressed in England. Paine did not understand
   German, but Kant, though always independent in the formation of his
   opinions, was evidently well acquainted with the literature of the
   Revolution, in America, England, and France.--Editor.]

   The most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and the
   greatest miseries, that have afflicted the human race have had their
   origin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion. It has been
   the most dishonourable belief against the character of the divinity, the
   most destructive to morality, and the peace and happiness of man, that
   ever was propagated since man began to exist. It is better, far better,
   that we admitted, if it were possible, a thousand devils to roam at large,
   and to preach publicly the doctrine of devils, if there were any such,
   than that we permitted one such impostor and monster as Moses, Joshua,
   Samuel, and the Bible prophets, to come with the pretended word of God in
   his mouth, and have credit among us.

   Whence arose all the horrid assassinations of whole nations of men, women,
   and infants, with which the Bible is filled; and the bloody persecutions,
   and tortures unto death and religious wars, that since that time have laid
   Europe in blood and ashes; whence arose they, but from this impious thing
   called revealed religion, and this monstrous belief that God has spoken to
   man? The lies of the Bible have been the cause of the one, and the lies of
   the Testament [of] the other.

   Some Christians pretend that Christianity was not established by the
   sword; but of what period of time do they speak? It was impossible that
   twelve men could begin with the sword: they had not the power; but no
   sooner were the professors of Christianity sufficiently powerful to employ
   the sword than they did so, and the stake and faggot too; and Mahomet
   could not do it sooner. By the same spirit that Peter cut off the ear of
   the high priest's servant (if the story be true) he would cut off his
   head, and the head of his master, had he been able. Besides this,
   Christianity grounds itself originally upon the [Hebrew] Bible, and the
   Bible was established altogether by the sword, and that in the worst use
   of it --not to terrify, but to extirpate. The Jews made no converts: they
   butchered all. The Bible is the sire of the [New] Testament, and both are
   called the word of God. The Christians read both books; the ministers
   preach from both books; and this thing called Cliristianity is made up of
   both. It is then false to say that Christianity was not established by the
   sword.

   The only sect that has not persecuted are the Quakers; and the only reason
   that can be given for it is, that they are rather Deists than Christians.
   They do not believe much about Jesus Christ, and they call the scriptures
   a dead letter. [This is an interesting and correct testimony as to the
   beliefs of the earlier Quakers, one of whom was Paine's father.--Editer.]
   Had they called them by a worse name, they had been nearer the truth.

   It is incumbent on every man who reverences the character of the Creator,
   and who wishes to lessen the catalogue of artificial miseries, and remove
   the cause that has sown persecutions thick among mankind, to expel all
   ideas of a revealed religion as a dangerous heresy, and an impious fraud.
   What is it that we have learned from this pretended thing called revealed
   religion? Nothing that is useful to man, and every thing that is
   disbonourable to his Maker. What is it the Bible teaches us?--repine,
   cruelty, and murder. What is it the Testament teaches us?--to believe that
   the Almighty committed debauchery with a woman engaged to be married; and
   the belief of this debauchery is called faith.

   As to the fragments of morality that are irregularly and thinly scattered
   in those books, they make no part of this pretended thing, revealed
   religion. They are the natural dictates of conscience, and the bonds by
   which society is held together, and without which it cannot exist; and are
   nearly the same in all religions, and in all societies. The Testament
   teaches nothing new upon this subject, and where it attempts to exceed, it
   becomes mean and ridiculous. The doctrine of not retaliating injuries is
   much better expressed in Proverbs, which is a collection as well from the
   Gentilcs as the Jews, than it is in the Testament. It is there said, (Xxv.
   2 I) "If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
   thirsty, give him water to drink:" [According to what is called Christ's
   sermon on the mount, in the book of Matthew, where, among some other [and]
   good things, a great deal of this feigned morality is introduced, it is
   there expressly said, that the doctrine of forbearance, or of not
   retaliating injuries, was not any part of the doctrine of the Jews; but as
   this doctrine is found in "Proverbs," it must, according to that
   statement, have been copied from the Gentiles, from whom Christ had leamed
   it. Those men whom Jewish and Christian idolators have abusively called
   heathen, had much better and clearer ideas of justice and morality than
   are to be found in the Old Testament, so far as it is Jewish, or in the
   New. The answer of Solon on the question, "Which is the most perfect
   popular govemment," has never been exceeded by any man since his time, as
   containing a maxim of political morality, "That," says he, "where the
   least injury done to the meanest individual, is considered as an insult on
   the whole constitution." Solon lived about 500 years before
   Christ.--Author.] but when it is said, as in the Testament, "If a man
   smite thee on the right chcek, turn to him the other also," it is
   assassinating the dignity of forbearance, and sinking man into a spaniel.

   Loving, of enemies is another dogma of feigned morality, and has besides
   no meaning. It is incumbent on man, as a moralist, that he does not
   revenge an injury; and it is equally as good in a political sense, for
   there is no end to retaliation; each retaliates on the other, and calls it
   justice: but to love in proportion to the injury, if it could be done,
   would be to offer a premium for a crime. Besides, the word enemies is too
   vague and general to be used in a moral maxim, which ought always to be
   clear and defined, like a proverb. If a man be the enemy of another from
   mistake and prejudice, as in the case of religious opinions, and sometimes
   in politics, that man is different to an enemy at heart with a criminal
   intention; and it is incumbent upon us, and it contributes also to our own
   tranquillity, that we put the best construction upon a thing that it will
   bear. But even this erroneous motive in him makes no motive for love on
   the other part; and to say that we can love voluntarily, and without a
   motive, is morally and physically impossible.

   Morality is injured by prescribing to it duties that, in the first place,
   are impossible to be performed, and if they could be would be productive
   of evil; or, as before said, be premiums for crime. The maxim of doing as
   we would be done unto does not include this strange doctrine of loving
   enemies; for no man expects to be loved himself for his crime or for his
   enmity.

   Those who preach this doctrine of loving their enemies, are in general the
   greatest persecutors, and they act consistently by so doing; for the
   doctrine is hypocritical, and it is natural that hypocrisy should act the
   reverse of what it preaches. For my own part, I disown the doctrine, and
   consider it as a feigned or fabulous morality; yet the man does not exist
   that can say I have persecuted him, or any man, or any set of men, either
   in the American Revolution, or in the French Revolution; or that I have,
   in any case, returned evil for evil. But it is not incumbent on man to
   reward a bad action with a good one, or to return good for evil; and
   wherever it is done, it is a voluntary act, and not a duty. It is also
   absurd to suppose that such doctrine can make any part of a revealed
   religion. We imitate the moral character of the Creator by forbearing with
   each other, for he forbears with all; but this doctrine would imply that
   he loved man, not in proportion as he was good, but as he was bad.

   If we consider the nature of our condition here, we must see there is no
   occasion for such a thing as revealed religion. What is it we want to
   know? Does not the creation, the universe we behold, preach to us the
   existence of an Almighty power, that governs and regulates the whole? And
   is not the evidence that this creation holds out to our senses infinitely
   stronger than any thing we can read in a book, that any imposter might
   make and call the word of God? As for morality, the knowledge of it exists
   in every man's conscience.

   Here we are. The existence of an Almighty power is sufficiently
   demonstrated to us, though we cannot conceive, as it is impossible we
   should, the nature and manner of its existence. We cannot conceive how we
   came here ourselves, and yet we know for a fact that we are here. We must
   know also, that the power that called us into being, can if he please, and
   when he pleases, call us to account for the manner in which we have lived
   here; and therefore without seeking any other motive for the belief, it is
   rational to believe that he will, for we know beforehand that he can. The
   probability or even possibility of the thing is all that we ought to know;
   for if we knew it as a fact, we should be the mere slaves of terror; our
   belief would have no merit, and our best actions no virtue.

   Deism then teaches us, without the possibility of being deceived, all that
   is necessary or proper to be known. The creation is the Bible of the
   deist. He there reads, in the hand-writing of the Creator himself, the
   certainty of his existence, and the immutability of his power; and all
   other Bibles and Testaments are to him forgeries. The probability that we
   may be called to account hereafter, will, to reflecting minds, have the
   influence of belief; for it is not our belief or disbelief that can make
   or unmake the fact. As this is the state we are in, and which it is proper
   we should be in, as free agents, it is the fool only, and not the
   philosopher, nor even the prudent man, that will live as if there were no
   God.

   But the belief of a God is so weakened by being mixed with the strange
   fable of the Christian creed, and with the wild adventures related in the
   Bible, and the obscurity and obscene nonsense of the Testament, that the
   mind of man is bewildered as in a fog. Viewing all these things in a
   confused mass, he confounds fact with fable; and as he cannot believe all,
   he feels a disposition to reject all. But the belief of a God is a belief
   distinct from all other things, and ought not to be confounded with any.
   The notion of a Trinity of Gods has enfeebled the belief of one God. A
   multiplication of beliefs acts as a division of belief; and in proportion
   as anything is divided, it is weakened.

   Religion, by such means, becomes a thing of form instead of fact; of
   notion instead of principle: morality is banished to make room for an
   imaginary thing called faith, and this faith has its origin in a supposed
   debauchery; a man is preached instead of a God; an execution is an object
   for gratitude; the preachers daub themselves with the blood, like a troop
   of assassins, and pretend to admire the brilliancy it gives them; they
   preach a humdrum sermon on the merits of the execution; then praise Jesus
   Christ for being executed, and condemn the Jews for doing it.

   A man, by hearing all this nonsense lumped and preached together,
   confounds the God of the Creation with the imagined God of the Christians,
   and lives as if there were none.

   Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is none more
   derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to
   reason, and more contradictory in itself, than this thing called
   Christianity. Too absurd for belief, too impossible to convince, and too
   inconsistent for practice, it renders the heart torpid, or produces only
   atheists and fanatics. As an engine of power, it serves the purpose of
   despotism; and as a means of wealth, the avarice of priests; but so far as
   respects the good of man in general, it leads to nothing here or
   hereafter.

   The only religion that has not been invented, and that has in it every
   evidence of divine originality, is pure and simple deism. It must have
   been the first and will probably be the last that man believes. But pure
   and simple deism does not answer the purpose of despotic governments. They
   cannot lay hold of religion as an engine but by mixing it with human
   inventions, and making their own authority a part; neither does it answer
   the avarice of priests, but by incorporating themselves and their
   functions with it, and becoming, like the government, a party in the
   system. It is this that forms the otherwise mysterious connection of
   church and state; the church human, and the state tyrannic.

   Were a man impressed as fully and strongly as he ought to be with the
   belief of a God, his moral life would be regulated by the forcc of belief;
   he would stand in awe of God, and of himself, and would not do the thing
   that could not be concealed from either. To give this belief the full
   opportunity of force, it is necessary that it acts alone. This is deism.

   But when, according to the Christian Trinitarian scheme, one part of God
   is represented by a dying man, and another part, called the Holy Ghost, by
   a flying pigeon, it is impossible that belief can attach itself to such
   wild conceits. [The book called the book of Matthew, says, (iii. 16,) that
   the Holy Ghost descended in the shape of a dove. It might as well have
   said a goose; the creatures are equally harmless, and the one is as much a
   nonsensical lie as the other. Acts, ii. 2, 3, says, that it descended in a
   mighty rushing wind, in the shape of cloven tongues: perbaps it was cloven
   feet. Such absurd stuff is fit only for tales of witches and
   wizards.--Author.

   It has been the scheme of the Christian church, and of all the other
   invented systems of religion, to hold man in ignorance of the Creator, as
   it is of government to hold him in ignorance of his rights. The systems of
   the one are as false as those of the other, and are calculated for mutual
   support. The study of theology as it stands in Christian churches, is the
   study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it
   proceeds by no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing;
   and admits of no conclusion. Not any thing can be studied as a science
   without our being in possession of the principles upon which it is
   founded; and as this is not the case with Christian theology, it is
   therefore the study of nothing.

   Instead then of studying theology, as is now done, out of the Bible and
   Testament, the meanings of which books are always controverted, and the
   authenticity of which is disproved, it is necessary that we refer to the
   Bible of the creation. The principles we discover there are eternal, and
   of divine origin: they are the foundation of all the science that exists
   in the world, and must be the foundation of theology.

   We can know God only through his works. We cannot have a conception of any
   one attribute, but by following some principle that leads to it. We have
   only a confused idea of his power, if we have not the means of
   comprehending something of its immensity. We can have no idea of his
   wisdom, but by knowing the order and manner in which it acts. The
   principles of science lead to this knowledge; for the Creator of man is
   the Creator of science, and it is through that medium that man can see
   God, as it were, face to face.

   Could a man be placed in a situation, and endowed with power of vision to
   behold at one view, and to contemplate deliberately, the structure of the
   universe, to mark the movements of the several planets, the cause of their
   varying appearances, the unerring order in which they revolve, even to the
   remotest comet, their connection and dependence on each other, and to know
   the system of laws established by the Creator, that governs and regulates
   the whole; he would then conceive, far beyond what any church theology can
   teach him, the power, the wisdom, the vastness, the munificence of the
   Creator. He would then see that all the knowledge man has of science, and
   that all the mechanical arts by which he renders his situation comfortable
   here, are derived from that source: his mind, exalted by the scene, and
   convinced by the fact, would increase in gratitude as it increased in
   knowledge: his religion or his worship would become united with his
   improvement as a man: any employment he followed that had connection with
   the principles of the creation,--as everything of agriculture, of science,
   and of the mechanical arts, has,--would teach him more of God, and of the
   gratitude he owes to him, than any theological Christian sermon he now
   hears. Great objects inspire great thoughts; great munificence excites
   great gratitude; but the grovelling tales and doctrines of the Bible and
   the Testament are fit only to excite contempt.

   Though man cannot arrive, at least in this life, at the actual scene I
   have described, he can demonstrate it, because he has knowledge of the
   principles upon which the creation is constructed. We know that the
   greatest works can be represented in inodel, and that the universe can be
   represented by the same means. The same principles by which we measure an
   inch or an acre of ground will measure to millions in extent. A circle of
   an inch diameter has the same geometrical properties as a circle that
   would circumscribe the universe. The same properties of a triangle that
   will demonstrate upon paper the course of a ship, will do it on the ocean;
   and, when applied to what are called the heavenly bodies, will ascertain
   to a minute the time of an eclipse, though those bodies are millions of
   miles distant from us. This knowledge is of divine origin; and it is from
   the Bible of the creation that man has learned it, and not from the stupid
   Bible of the church, that teaches man nothing. [The Bible-makers have
   undertaken to give us, in the first chapter of Genesis, an account of the
   creation; and in doing this they have demonstrated nothing but their
   ignorance. They make there to have been three days and three nights,
   evenings and mornings, before there was any sun; when it is the presence
   or absence of the sun that is the cause of day and night--and what is
   called his rising and setting that of moming and evening. Besides, it is a
   puerile and pitiful idea, to suppose the Almighty to say, "Let there be
   light." It is the imperative manner of speaking that a conjuror uses when
   he says to his cups and balls, Presto, be gone--and most probably has been
   taken from it, as Moses and his rod is a conjuror and his wand. Longinus
   calls this expression the sublime; and by the same rule the conjurer is
   sublime too; for the manner of speaking is expressively and grammatically
   the same. When authors and critics talk of the sublime, they see not how
   nearly it borders on the ridiculous. The sublime of the critics, like some
   parts of Edmund Burke's sublime and beautiful, is like a windmill just
   visible in a fog, which imaginanation might distort into a flying
   mountain, or an archangel, or a flock of wild geese.--Author.]

   All the knowledge man has of science and of machinery, by the aid of which
   his existence is rendered comfortable upon earth, and without which he
   would be scarcely distinguishable in appearance and condition from a
   common animal, comes from the great machine and structure of the universe.
   The constant and unwearied observations of our ancestors upon the
   movements and revolutions of the heavenly bodies, in what are supposed to
   have been the early ages of the world, have brought this knowledge upon
   earth. It is not Moses and the prophets, nor Jesus Christ, nor his
   apostles, that have done it. The Almighty is the great mechanic of the
   creation, the first philosopher, and original teacher of all science. Let
   us then learn to reverence our master, and not forget the labours of our
   ancestors.

   Had we, at this day, no knowledge of machinery, and were it possible that
   man could have a view, as I have before described, of the structure and
   machinery of the universe, he would soon conceive the idea of constructing
   some at least of the mechanical works we now have; and the idea so
   conceived would progressively advance in practice. Or could a model of the
   universe, such as is called an orrery, be presented before him and put in
   motion, his mind would arrive at the same idea. Such an object and such a
   subject would, whilst it improved him in knowledge useful to himself as a
   man and a member of society, as well as entertaining, afford far better
   matter for impressing him with a knowledge of, and a belief in the
   Creator, and of the reverence and gratitude that man owes to him, than the
   stupid texts of the Bible and the Testament, from which, be the talents of
   the preacher; what they may, only stupid sermons can be preached. If man
   must preach, let him preach something that is edifying, and from the texts
   that are known to be true.

   The Bible of the creation is inexhaustible in texts. Every part of
   science, whether connected with the geometry of the universe, with the
   systems of animal and vegetable life, or with the properties of inanimate
   matter, is a text as well for devotion as for philosophy--for gratitude,
   as for human improvement. It will perhaps be said, that if such a
   revolution in the system of religion takes place, every preacher ought to
   be a philosopher. Most certainly, and every house of devotion a school of
   science.

   It has been by wandering from the immutable laws of science, and the light
   of reason, and setting up an invented thing called "revealed religion,"
   that so many wild and blasphemous conceits have been formed of the
   Almighty. The Jews have made him the assassin of the human species, to
   make room for the religion of the Jews. The Christians have made him the
   murderer of himself, and the founder of a new religion to supersede and
   expel the Jewish religion. And to find pretence and admission for these
   things, they must have supposed his power or his wisdom imperfect, or his
   will changeable; and the changeableness of the will is the imperfection of
   the judgement. The philosopher knows that the laws of the Creator have
   never changed, with respect either to the principles of science, or the
   properties of matter. Why then is it to be supposed they have changed with
   respect to man?

   I here close the subject. I have shown in all the foregoing parts of this
   work that the Bible and Testament are impositions and forgeries; and I
   leave the evidence I have produced in proof of it to be refuted, if any
   one can do it; and I leave the ideas that are suggested in the conclusion
   of the work to rest on the mind of the reader; certain as I am that when
   opinions are free, either in matters of govemment or religion, truth will
   finally and powerfully prevail.
