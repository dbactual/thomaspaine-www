   USEFUL *and* ENTERTAINING HINTS
   from the *Pennsylvania Magazine* February, 1775.

   "The real value of a thing, Is as much money as 'twill bring."

   IN the possession of the Philadelphia-Library Company (See Note), is a cabinet of
   Fossils, with several specimens of earth, clay, sand, &c. with some
   account of each, and where brought from. 
   
   Note: In the catalogue it is called a collection of *American* fossils, &c., but a 
   considerable part of them are foreign ones; I presume, that the collector, in order 
   to judge the better of such as he might discover here, made first a collection of such 
   foreign ones whose values were known, in order to compare by: as his design seems rather 
   bent towards discovering the treasures of America, than merely to make a collection.
   
   I have always considered these
   kinds of researches as productive of many advantages, and in a new country
   they are particularly so. As subjects for speculation, they afford
   entertainment to the curious; but as objects of utility, they merit a
   closer attention. The same materials which delight the Fossilist, enrich
   the manufacturer and the merchant. While the one is scientifically
   examining their structure and composition, the others by industry and
   commerce are transmuting them to gold. Possessed of the power of
   pleasing, they gratify on both sides; the one contemplates their *natural*
   beauties in the cabinet, the others, their *recreated* ones in the coffer.

   'Tis by the researches of the virtuoso that the hidden parts of the earth
   are brought to light, and from his discoveries of its qualities, the
   potter, the glass-maker, and numerous other artists, are enabled to furnish
   us with their productions. Artists considered *merely* as such, would have
   made but a slender progress, had they not been led on by the enterprising
   spirit of the curious. I am unwilling to dismiss this remark, without
   entering my protest against that unkind, ungrateful and impolitic custom
   of ridiculing unsuccessful experiments. And of informing those unwise or
   over wise pasquinaders, that half the felicities they enjoy, sprung
   originally from generous curiosity.

   Were a man to propose, or set out to bore his lands, as a carpenter does a
   board, he might probably bring on himself a shower of witticisms; and
   tho' he could not be jested at for *building castles in the air*, yet many
   *magnanimous* laughs might break forth at his expence, and vociferously
   predict the explosion of a mine in his subterraneous pursuits. I am led to
   this reflection by the present domestic state of America, because it will
   unavoidably happen, that before we can arrive at that perfection of things
   which other nations have acquired, many hopes will fail, many whimsical
   attempts will become fortunate, and many reasonable ones end in air and
   expense. *The degree of improvement which America has already arrived at is
   unparalleled* and *astonishing*, but 'tis miniature to what she will one day
   boast of, if heaven continue her happiness. We have nearly one whole
   region yet unexplored; I mean the internal region of the earth. By
   industry and tillage we have acquired a considerable knowledge of what
   America will *produce*, but very little of what it *contains*. The bowels of
   the earth have been only slightly inquired into: We seem to content
   ourselves with such parts of it as are absolutely necessary, and cannot
   well be imported; as brick, stone, etc. but have gone very little
   farther, except in the article of iron. The glass and the pottery
   manufactures are yet very imperfect, and will continue so, till some
   curious researcher finds out the proper material. &mdash;

   Copper (see note), Lead, and Tin, articles valuable both in their simple states, and
   as being the component parts of other metals, (viz. brass and pewter) are
   at present but little known throughout the continent in their mineral
   form: yet I doubt not, but very valuable mines of them, are daily
   travelled over in the western parts of America. Perhaps a few feet of
   surface conceal a treasure sufficient to enrich a kingdom.
   
   Note: I am quite at a loss to know what is meant by WHITE LEAD ORE, mentioned 
   in the catalogue; there being no such thing. White lead does not exist in a mineral 
   state, but is prepared from common lead, by the following process. A large wood 
   trough 30 or 40 feet square is divided by wood partitions into squares of about one 
   foot each. These squares are filled with the vinegar, which is kept moderately hot, 
   by means of large beds of new horse dung under the troughs. Common sheet led is cut 
   into square pieces and put in the vinegar, which acts upon it as a menstruum, and 
   changes it into white lead. When the pieces of land appear white and flaky, they 
   are taken out and thrown under a stone roller (which goes over them as a Tanner 
   grinds Bark,) and beats off such parts of the lead as are already changed into 
   white lead, the remainder is again thrown into the vinegar. Fire will restore white 
   lead to common lead again. 

   The value of the interior part of the earth (like ourselves) cannot be
   judged certainly of by the surface, neither do the corresponding strata lie
   with the unvariable order of the colours of the rainbow, (See Note) and if they ever
   did (which I do not believe) age and misfortune have now broken in upon
   their union; earthquakes, deluges and volcanoes have so disunited and
   reunited them, that in their present state they appear like a world in
   ruins. &mdash; Yet ruins are beautiful. &mdash; The caverns, museums of antiquities.

   Though nature is gay, polite, and generous abroad, she is sullen, rude, and
   niggardly at home: Return the visit, and she admits you with all the
   suspicion of a miser, and all the reluctance of an antiquated beauty
   retired to replenish her charms. Bred up in antediluvian notions, she has
   not yet acquired the European taste of receiving visitants in her
   dressing room: She locks and bolts up her private recesses with
   extraordinary care, as if not only resolved to preserve her hoards, but to
   conceal her age, and hide the remains of a face that was young and lovely
   in the days of Adam. He that would view nature in her undress, and partake
   of her internal treasures, must proceed with the resolution of a robber,
   if not a ravisher. She gives no invitation to follow her to the cavern. &mdash;
   The external earth makes no proclamation, of the interior stores, but
   leaves to chance and industry, the discovery of the whole. In such gifts
   as nature can annually recreate, she is noble and profuse, and entertains
   the whole world with the *interest* of her fortunes; but watches over the
   *capital* with the care of a miser. Her gold and jewels lie concealed in the
   earth, in caves of utter darkness; and hoards of wealth, heaps upon heaps,
   mould in the chests, like the riches of a Necromancer's cell. It must be
   very pleasant to an adventurous speculist to make excursions into these
   Gothic regions; and in his travels he may possibly come to a cabinet
   locked up in some rocky vault, whose treasures shall reward his toil, and
   enable him to shine on his return, as splendidly as nature herself.

   By a small degree of attention to the order and origin of things, we shall
   perceive, that tho' the *surface* of the earth *produce* us the *necessaries*
   of life, yet 'tis from the *mine* we extract the *conveniences* thereof. Our
   houses would diminish to wigwams, furnished in the Indian stile, and
   ourselves resemble the building, were it not for the ores of the earth.
   Agriculture and manufactures would wither away for want of tools and
   implements, and commerce stand still for want of materials. The beasts of
   the field would elude our power, and the birds of the air get beyond our
   reach. Our dominion would shrink to a narrow circle, and the mind itself,
   partaking of the change, would contract its prospects, and lessen into
   almost animal instinct. Take away but the single article of iron, and half
   the felicities of life fall with it. Little as we may prize this common
   ore, the loss of it would *cut* deeper than the use of it. And by the way of
   laughing off misfortunes 'tis easy to prove, by this method of
   investigation, that *an iron age is better than a golden one.*

   Since so great a portion of our enjoyments is drawn from the mine, it is
   certainly an evidence of our prudence, to enquire and know what our
   possessions are. Every man's landed property extends to the surface of
   the earth. Why then should he sit down contented with a part, and practise
   upon his estate those fashionable follies in life, which prefer the
   superfice to the solid? Curiosity alone, should the thought occur
   conveniently, would move an active mind to examine (though not to the
   bottom) at least to a considerable depth.

   The propriety and reasonableness of these internal enquiries are
   continually pointed out to us by numberless occurrences. Accident is
   almost every day turning out some new secret from the earth. How often has
   the plow-share or the spade broken open a treasure, which for ages, perhaps
   for ever, had lain but just beneath the surface? And th0' every estate have 
   not mines of gold
   or silver, yet they may contain some strata of valuable earth proper for
   manufactures; and if they have not those, there is a great probability of
   their having chalk, marl, or some rich soil proper for manure, which only
   requires to be removed to the surface.

   I have been informed of some land in England being raised to four times
   its former value by the discovery of a chalk or marl pit, in digging a
   hole to fix a post in; and in embanking a meadow in the Jerseys, the
   laborers threw out with the soil, a fine blue powderly earth, resembling
   indigo, which, when mixed with oil, was used for paint. I imagine the vein
   is now exhausted.
   
   Those who are inclined to make researches of this kind, will find their
   endeavours greatly facilitated by the use of the following instrument.
   
   *Description of a set of Borers used in boring land, and in order to find its 
   internal composition.*
   
   A set of borers consists of any number of pieces, according to the depth 
   intended to be bored to. Those which I saw, and have here described, had 20 
   pieces of about 2 feet long each, and about an inch and half diameter. The first 
   piece has a bit like a wood borer, and grooved like a gimblet, on which is to be 
   fixt an iron cross bar, to turn it by. When the first piece has descended to its 
   depth, the crossbar is taken off, and the second piece, grooved like the first, 
   is joined to it, much in the same manner as a soldiers bayonet is fixed to the 
   musket, but so, that the groove of the second, lie in a line with the first. The 
   crossbar is then put on the top of the second piece, and when that has descended, 
   the third is fixed on in the same manner as the second, with the groove in the same 
   line, and so for all the rest. &mdash; It is evident that if the whole 20 pieces were to 
   descend, and not be drawn up till the last, that the different soils through which 
   the borer had passed, would lie in the grooves in the same order, and at the same 
   distance from the surface, and from each other, that they laid in the earth; and 
   that by repeating the operation in different parts of the land, *the direction, extent, 
   length, and thickness of any, or all the strata would be known*. But as it will require 
   an extraordinary force both to bore down. Then draw up the whole number of pieces, it 
   will be necessary to loosen them up frequently drawing them up, and likewise to have 
   an additional fore-piece something bigger than the rest, to enlarge the hole by. A 
   few trials will explain the whole. The two chief things to observe our, not to lay 
   the borers fast, as they cannot be released like a wedge; nor to branch them the 
   contrary way, lest you separate them, for by so doing the lower parts will be your 
   irrecoverably lost.

   Experiments of this kind are not attended with any considerable expence, and they give 
   as much knowledge of the internal structure of the earth, as will be obtained by fifty 
   times the same expense in digging to any considerable depth, and much more expeditiously.


   Many valuable ores, clays, &c. appear in such rude forms in their natural
   state, as not even to excite *curiosity*, much less *attention*. A true
   knowledge of their different value can only be obtained by experiment: As
   soil proper for *manure*, they may be judged of by the planter; but as
   *matter*, they come under the enquiry of the philosopher. &mdash; This leads me to
   reflect with inexpressible pleasure, on the numberless benefits arising to
   a community, by the institution of societies for promoting useful
   knowledge.

   The American Philosophical Society, like the Royal Society in England, by
   having public spirit for its support, and public good for its object, is a
   treasure we ought to glory in. Here the defective knowledge of the
   individual is supplied by the common stock. Societies, without endangering
   private fortunes, are enabled to proceed in their enquiries by analysis
   and experiment: But individuals are seldom furnished with conveniences for
   so doing, and generally rest their opinion on reasonable conjecture.

   I presume that were samples of different soils from different parts of
   America, presented to the society for their inspection and examination, it
   would greatly facilitate our knowledge of the internal earth, and give a
   new spring both to agriculture and manufactures.

   These hints are not intended to lament any loss of time, or remissness in
   the pursuit of useful knowledge, but to furnish matter for future studies;
   that while we glory in what we *are*, we may not neglect what we *are to be*.

   Of the present state we may justly say, that no nation under heaven ever
   struck out in so short a time, and with so much spirit and reputation,
   into the labyrinth of art and science; and *that not* in the *acquisition*
   knowledge only, but in the happy advantages flowing *from it*. The world
   does not at this day exhibit a parallel, neither can history produce its
   equal.

   ATLANTICUS.
