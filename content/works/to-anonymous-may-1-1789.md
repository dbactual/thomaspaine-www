   ROTHERHAM,

   SIR:

   We have erected our experiment rib, and struck the center. The Messrs.
   Walker join me in compliments, and an invitation to you to come and survey
   our handiwork. Please favor me with a line when we may expect you, that I
   may not be out of the way.

   I am, Sir, Your obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
