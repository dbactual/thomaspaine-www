   London April 16th 1790

   My Dear Friend

   To begin with our Journey, we had a very pleasant one &mdash; we got to 
   Boulogne on Saturday about 5 o'clock &mdash; (left Paris Thursday about the 
   same time) passed from Boulogne to Dover in three hours and a half &mdash; 
   and got to London Monday Evening &mdash; sent all your Packets to W. Corvie 
   &mdash; and though we have alternately called on each other have not yet met 
   &mdash; for three or four days after our arrival I missed the little Box for 
   Mr. Macpherson which gave me exceeding great concern, and it appeared to me 
   that I had rather have lost my portmanteau; neither Mr. Rutledge nor I could 
   divine what had become of it, when, to our great satisfaction it appeared, as 
   of itself. I know not how, for going on Evening into my room it presented 
   itself to me on the table &mdash; I almost said to it &mdash; "Thou little 
   runaway where hast thou been and why hast thou
   plagued me so" &mdash; It had I suppose slipped into some corner and the girl
   in putting the room to rights had found it &mdash;

   The morning after my arrival I went first to Debrets Bookseller
   Piccadilly (he is the opposition Bookseller) he informed me that Mr.
   Burke's pamphlet was in the press, (he is not the publisher) that he
   believed Mr. Burke was much at a loss how to go on, that he had revised
   some of the sheets, 6, 7, 8, and one 9 times &mdash; I then made an
   appointment with Lord Stanhope, and another with Mr. Fox &mdash; the former
   received me with saying "have I the pleasure of shaking hands with the
   author of Common Sense?" &mdash; I told him of the condition of Mr. Burke's
   pamphlet, and that I had formed to myself the design of answering it, if
   it should come out at a time when I could devote myself to it &mdash; from 
   Lord Stanhope I went to Mr. Fox, but how was I disappointed to find that he 
   had not received my letter from Paris, that letter (as you will recollect the
   Contents of it) laid down all the principal points with respect to the
   french Revolution, the Test Act, &c which I intended as subjects for
   Conversation when we mett &mdash; you will recollect that I expressed some
   surprise to you at the Postage which the servant took for it &mdash; and I 
   cannot avoid suspecting that he never put the letter in the office &mdash; I
   mention this that you may question him about it, and be on your guard with 
   respect to your own letters &mdash; I always reproach myself for trusting 
   letters by a servant &mdash; I sent one to the post-office in London to go by 
   Packet to America &mdash; the servant brought me 17 shillings out of a Guinea, 
   but the letter never arrived.

   The Conversation with Mr. Fox was chiefly on European Politics &mdash; There 
   will be no Peace, said he, between the Russians Austrians and Turks if the
   King of Prussia can prevent it &mdash; I replied that the Turks must be
   exceedingly unwise indeed not to see that he Prussia would keep the Turks
   for ever at War with Russia and Austria, if he could &mdash; because it took 
   two powerful Enemies off his hands whom he would dread if that peace was
   concluded, and rather than have it concluded he would probably join in
   the War &mdash; from an apprehension, that if peace was now made with the 
   Turks, Russia and Austria would both attack him &mdash; in this Mr. Fox 
   agreed &mdash; I then spoke of the Reports which were circulated when that 
   war first broke out, that the English Court had spirited up that war on an 
   expectation of drawing France to the support of the Turks &mdash; that the 
   policy, besides being wicked, was exceedingly illjudged, for the effect of 
   the Policy went to do France a favour by setting her free from a connection 
   which, by the change of Circumstances on the Continent since that Connection 
   was formed, had not now one Article remaining which induced the Connection, 
   nor any new ones to supply their place &mdash; that the dissolution of it 
   opened the way to a connection between France and Russia, which was an event 
   the English Cabinet appeared to me not to have sense enough to foresee &mdash; 
   Mr. Fox replied that the English Ministry had always denied the accusation
   of spiriting up that war, but that for his part he believed they were
   not so clear of the charge as they wished to appear &mdash; I talked to him of
   Mr. Burke's pamphlet, and said that I believed I should reply to it &mdash; I
   afterwards saw Sir George Staunton to whom I mentioned the same thing &mdash; 
   I told him of a letter I saw from Mr. B- to a gentleman at Paris, the
   contents of which surprised me &mdash; He asked me if it was not to Mr. 
   Christie, and spoke of you in very handsome terms &mdash; he afterwards told 
   me of a letter
   from some gentleman at Paris to Mr. Burke &mdash; perhaps thought I it is my
   friend Christie, but I did not ask &mdash;

   But I am now inclined to think that after all this vapouring of Mr. B-, he
   will not publish his pamphlet &mdash; I called yesterday at Debrets, who told 
   me &mdash; that he has stopped the work (I have not called on Mr. Burke 
   &mdash; and shall not until his pamphlet comes out or he gives it up &mdash;) 
   I met Dr. Lawrence, an intimate friend of Mr. Burke a few days ago - to whom 
   I said, "I am exceedingly sorry to see a friend of ours so exceedingly wrong." 
   "Time," says he, "will show if he is."  &mdash; he is, said I, already wrong 
   with respect to time past &mdash;  One of the Messr. Walker from Rotherham has 
   come to London, and we have sent a person down to conduct at the Bridge 
   &mdash; I hope if Mr. B- intends to publish, it will be before I am too much 
   engaged &mdash; Apropos. I should have told you &mdash; that Mr. Burke's 
   Letter is to be addressed to Lally Tollendal &mdash;

   I shall in a few days write to my Dear Friend, the Marquis de la Fayette 
   &mdash; In the mean Time I wish you to call upon him and tell him my intention 
   &mdash; I shall send it in the Marquis de la Lucerne's despatches &mdash; 
   forget not to remember me to him very affectionately and also to Madame de la 
   Fayette &mdash; Shake hands for me with my old friend Mr. Mazzei &mdash; call 
   upon our friends
   at No 36 Palais Royal &mdash; and forget me not among the rest of our
   acquaintances &mdash; and if there is any thing I can serve you in here or
   elsewhere, the greatest favor you can do me is to inform me of it.

   I am my Dear Friend,

   yours very affectionately

   THOMAS PAINE.
