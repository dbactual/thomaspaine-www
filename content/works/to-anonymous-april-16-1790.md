   LONDON,

   MY DEAR FRIEND:

   To begin with our journey, we had a very pleasant one. We got to Boulogne
   on Saturday about five o'clock-(left Paris Thursday about the same time)
   passed from Boulogne to Dover in three hours and a half, and got to London
   Monday evening. Sent all your packets to W. Corvie, and though we have
   alternately called on each other have not yet met. For three or four days
   after our arrival I missed the little box for Mr. Macpherson which gave me
   exceeding great concern, and it appeared to me that I had rather have lost
   my portmanteau. Neither Mr. Rutledge nor I could divine what had become of
   it, when, to our great satisfaction it appeared, as of itself! I know not
   how, for, going one evening into my room, it presented itself to me on the
   table. "Thou little runaway; where hast thou been, and why hast thou
   plagued me so?" It had, I suppose, slipped into some corner, and the girl
   in putting the room to rights, had found it!

   The morning after my arrival I went first to Debrets, bookseller,
   Piccadilly; (he is the opposition bookseller). He informed me that Mr.
   Burke's pamphlet was in the press (he is not the publisher), that he
   believed Mr. Burke was much at a loss how to go on; that he had revised
   some of the sheets, six, seven, and one nine times! I then made an
   appointment with Lord Stanhope, and another with Mr. Fox. 191 The former
   received me with saying "have I the pleasure of shaking hands with the
   author of Common Sense?" I told him of the condition of Mr. Burke's
   pamphlet, and that I had formed to myself the design of answering it, if
   it should come out at a time when I could devote myself to it. From Lord
   Stanhope I went to Mr. Fox, but how was I disappointed to find that he had
   not received my letter from Paris. That letter (as you will recollect the
   contents of it), laid down all the principal points with respect to the
   French Revolution, the Test Act, etc., which I intended for subjects for
   conversation when we met. You will recollect that I expressed some
   surprise to you at the postage which the servant took for it, and I cannot
   avoid suspecting that he never put the letter in the office. I mention
   this that you may question him about it, and be on your guard with respect
   to your own letters. I always reproach myself for trusting letters by a
   servant: I sent one to the post-office in London to go by packet to
   America. The servant brought me 17 shillings out of a guinea, but the
   letter never arrived.

   The conversation with Mr. Fox was chiefly on European politics. There will
   be no peace, said he, between the Russians, Austrians and Turks, if the
   King of Prussia can prevent it. I replied that the Turks must be
   exceedingly unwise, indeed, not to see that Prussia would keep the Turks
   forever at war with Russia and Austria, if he could, because it took two
   powerful enemies off his hands, whom he would dread if that peace was
   concluded, and rather than have it concluded, he would probably join in
   the war, from an apprehension that if peace was now made with the Turks,
   Russia and Austria would both attack him. On this Mr. Fox agreed. I then
   spoke of the reports which were circulated when that war first broke out,
   that the English Court had spirited up that war on an expectation of
   drawing France to the support of the Turks; that the policy, besides being
   wicked, was exceedingly ill-judged, for the effect of the policy went to
   do France a favor by setting her free from a connection which, by the
   change of circumstances on the continent since that connection was formed
   had not now one Article remaining which induced the connection, nor any
   new ones to supply their place, that the dissolution of it opened the way
   to a connection between France and Russia, which was an event the English
   Cabinet appeared to me not to have sense enough to foresee.

   Mr. Fox replied that the English Ministry had always denied the accusation
   of spiriting up that war, but that, for his part, he believed they were
   not so clear of the charge as they wished to appear. I talked to him of
   Mr. Burke's pamphlet, and said that I believed I should reply to it. I
   afterwards saw Sir George Staunton, to whom I mentioned the same thing. I
   told him of a letter I saw from Mr. B. to a gentleman at Paris, the
   contents of which surprised me. He asked me if it was not to Mr. Christie,
   and spoke of you in very handsome terms. He afterwards told me of a letter
   from a gentleman at Paris to Mr. Burke. Perhaps, thought I, it is my
   friend Christie, but I did not ask.

   But I am now inclined to think that after all this vaporing of Mr. B., he
   will not publish his pamphlet. I called yesterday at Debrets, who told me
   that he has stopped the work. (I had not called on Mr. Burke, and shall
   not, until his pamphlet comes out, or he gives it up.) I met Dr. Lawrence,
   an intimate friend of Mr. Burke, a few days ago, to whom I said, "I am
   exceedingly sorry to see a friend of ours so exceedingly wrong." "Time,"
   says he, "will show if he is." He is, said I, already wrong with respect
   to time past.

   One of the Messrs. Walker, from Rotherham, has come to London, and we have
   sent a person down to conduct at the Bridge. I hope if Mr. Burke intends
   to publish, it will be before I am too much engaged. Apropos, I should
   have told you that Mr. Burke's letter is to be addressed to Lally
   Tollendal.

   I shall in a few days write to my dear friend, the Marquis de Lafayette.
   In the meantime I wish you to call upon him and tell him my intention. I
   shall send it in the Marquis de la Lucerne's despatches. Forget not to
   remember me to him very affectionately, and also to Madame de Lafayette.
   Shake hands for me with my old friend, Mr. Mazzei. Call upon our friends
   at No. 36 Palais Royal, and forget me not among the rest of our
   acquaintances. And if there is anything I can serve you in here, or
   elsewhere, the greatest favor you can do me is to inform me of it.

   I am, my Dear Friend,

   Yours very affectionately,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   Tomorrow I dine at Mr. Vaughn's with Dr. Price.

   Direct to me, No. 31 King Street, near Soho Square.

   We have had very cold weather-snow and rain for a week past!

   If you have an opportunity of seeing the Duke de la Rochefoucault,
   remember me to him, and to his very kind and good family. Compliments to
   Mr. Short, M. de Condorcet and Mr. Le Roy.

   Did you deliver Mr. Mazzei's letter to Dr. Gern?

   Send letters for agent at Philadelphia, M. D' Erembourg.
