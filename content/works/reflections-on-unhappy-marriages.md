   THE OLD BACHELOR IV
   
   *Reflections on unhappy Marriages*

   from the *Pennsylvania Magazine*, June, 1775

   THOUGH 'tis confessed on all hands that the weal or woe of life depends
   on no one circumstance so critical as Matrimony; yet how few seem to be
   influenced by this universal acknowledgement, or act with a caution
   becoming the danger!

   Those that are undone this way, are the young, the rash and amorous, whose
   hearts are ever glowing with desire, whose eyes are ever roaming after
   beauty; these doat on the first amiable image that chance throws in their
   way, and when the flame is once kindled, would risk eternity itself to
   appease it. &mdash; But, still like their first parents, they no sooner taste the
   tempting fruit, but their eyes are open'd; the folly of their intemperance
   becomes visible; shame succeeds first, and then repentance; but sorrow for
   themselves soon returns to anger with the innocent cause of their
   unhappiness. Hence flow bitter reproaches, and keen invectives, which end
   in mutual hatred and contempt. Love abhors clamour and soon flies away, and
   happiness finds no entrance when love is gone. Thus for a few hours of
   dalliance, I will not call it affection, the repose of all their future
   days are sacrificed; and those who but just before seem'd to live only for
   each other, now would almost cease to live, that the separation might be
   eternal.

   But hold, says the man of phlegm and oeconomy, all are not of this hasty
   turn &mdash; I allow it &mdash; there are persons in the world who are young without
   passions, and in health without appetite: these hunt out a wife as they go
   to *Smithfield* for a horse; and inter-marry fortunes, not minds, or even
   bodies: In this case the Bridegroom has no joy but in taking possession of
   the portion, and the bride dreams of little beside new cloths, visits and
   congratulations. Thus, as their expectations of pleasure are not very
   great, neither is the disappointment very grievous; they just keep each
   other in countenance, live decently, and are exactly as fond the twentieth
   year of matrimony as the first. &mdash; But I would not advise any one to call
   this state of insipidity happiness, because it would argue him both
   ignorant of its nature, and incapable of enjoying it. &mdash; Mere absence of pain
   will undoubtedly constitute ease; and, without ease, there can be no
   happiness: Ease, however, is but the medium, through which happiness is
   tasted, and but passively receives what the last actually bestows; if
   therefore the rash who marry inconsiderately, perish in the storms raised
   by their own passions, these slumber away their days in a sluggish calm,
   and rather dream they live, than experience it by a series of actual
   sensible enjoyments.

   As matrimonial happiness is neither the result of insipidity, or
   illgrounded passion, surely those, who make their court to age, ugliness,
   and all that's detestable both in mind and body, cannot hope to find it,
   tho' qualified with all the riches that avarice covets, or *Plutus* could
   bestow. Matches of this kind are downright prostitution, however softened
   by the letter of the law; and he or she who receives the golden equivalent
   of youth and beauty, so wretchedly bestowed, can never enjoy what they so
   dearly purchased. The shocking incumbrance would render the sumptuous
   banquet tasteless, and the magnificent bed lothsome; rest would disdain
   the one, and appetite sicken at the other; uneasiness wait upon both; even
   gratitude itself would almost cease to be obliging, and good-manners grow
   such a burden, that the best bred or best-natured people breathing, would
   be often tempted to throw it down.

   But say we should not wonder that those who either marry gold without
   love, or love without gold, should be miserable; I can't forbear being
   astonished, if such whose fortunes are affluent, whose desires were
   mutual, who equally languished for the happy moment before it came, and
   seemed for a while to be equally transported when it had taken place: If
   even these should, in the end, prove as unhappy as either of the others!
   And yet how often is this the melancholy circumstance! As extasy abates,
   coolness succeeds, which often makes way for indifference, and that for
   neglect: Sure of each other by the nuptial band, they no longer take any
   pains to be mutually agreeable; careless if they displease, and yet angry
   if reproached; with so little relish for each other's company that
   anybody's else is welcome, and more entertaining. Their union thus broke,
   they pursue separate pleasures; never meet but to wrangle, or part but to
   find comfort in other society. After this the descent is easy to utter
   aversion, which having wearied itself out with heart-burnings, clamours,
   and affronts, subsides into a perfect insensibility; when fresh objects of
   love step in to their relief on either side, and mutual infidelity makes
   way for mutual complaisance, that each may be the better able to deceive
   the other.

   I shall conclude with the sentiments of an American savage on this
   subject, who being advised by one of our countrymen to marry according to
   the ceremonies of the church, as being the ordinance of an infinitely wise
   and good God, briskly replied, "That either the Christians' God was not so
   good and wise as he was represented, or he never meddled with the
   marriages of his people; since not one in a hundred of them had anything
   to do either with happiness or common sense. Hence, continued he, as
   soon as ever you meet you long to part; and, not having this relief in
   your power, by way of revenge, double each other's misery. Whereas in
   ours, which have no other ceremony than mutual affection, and last no
   longer than they bestow mutual pleasures, we make it our business to
   oblige the heart we are afraid to lose; and being at liberty to separate,
   seldom or never feel the inclination. But if any should be found so
   wretched among us, as to hate where the only commerce ought to be love, we
   instantly dissolve the band: God made us all in pairs; each has his mate
   somewhere or other; and 'tis our duty to find each other out, since no
   creature was ever intended to be miserable."
