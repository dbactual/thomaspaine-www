Title: The Crisis IX

   Foner's introduction:

   The Ninth Crisis was written during an extremely gloomy period of the War.
   On May 28, 1780, Washington's letter to Joseph Reed of Pennsylvania
   describing the desperate situation of the American Army was read to the
   Pennsylvania Assembly by Thomas Paine, the Clerk. "I assure you," Paine

   read from Washington's letter, "every idea you can form of our distresses
   will fall short of the reality. There is such a combination of
   circumstances to exhaust the patience of the soldiery that it begins at
   length to be worn out, and we see in every line of the army the most
   serious features of mutiny and sedition."

   Paine immediately proposed that a fund of money be raised to aid the
   patriot cause and headed the subscription with five hundred dollars. The
   idea rapidly spread, and resulted in the raising of ^300,000 which was
   used to supply the Army through the campaign.

   On May 12, 1780, Charleston, South Carolina, besieged by the British for
   forty days, surrendered and General Lincoln and his whole army of 3,000
   Continental soldiers became prisoners of war. His spirit and confidence
   not at all dashed by this discouraging news, Paine declared in this
   Crisis, which is dated June 9, 1780, that the reported fate of Charleston,
   "afflicting as it may be . . . will renew in us the spirit of former days,
   and will produce in us an advantage more important than its loss." Such
   piecemeal work, he points out, was not conquering the continent. In a
   postscript he adds: "Charleston is gone, and I believe for the want of a
   sufficient supply of provisions. The man that does not now feel for the
   honor of the best and noblest cause that ever a country engaged in, and
   exert himself accordingly, is no longer worthy of a peaceable residence
   among a people determined to be free."

   ****************

   HAD America pursued her advantages with half the spirit that she resisted
   her misfortunes, she would, before now, have been a conquering and a
   peaceful people; but lulled in the lap of soft tranquillity, she rested on
   her hopes, and adversity only has convulsed her into action. Whether
   subtlety or sincerity at the close of the last year induced the enemy to
   an appearance for peace, is a point not material to know; it is sufficient
   that we see the effects it has had on our politics, and that we sternly
   rise to resent the delusion.

   The war, on the part of America, has been a war of natural feelings. Brave
   in distress; serene in conquest; drowsy while at rest; and in every
   situation generously disposed to peace; a dangerous calm, and a most
   heightened zeal have, as circumstances varied, succeeded each other. Every
   passion but that of despair has been called to a tour of duty; and so
   mistaken has been the enemy, of our abilities and disposition, that when
   she supposed us conquered, we rose the conquerors. The extensiveness of
   the United States, and the variety of their resources; the universality of
   their cause, the quick operation of their feelings, and the similarity of
   their sentiments, have, in every trying situation, produced a something,
   which, favored by providence, and pursued with ardor, has accomplished in
   an instant the business of a campaign. We have never deliberately sought
   victory, but snatched it; and bravely undone in an hour the blotted
   operations of a season.

   The reported fate of Charleston, like the misfortunes of 1776, has at last
   called forth a spirit, and kindled up a flame, which perhaps no other
   event could have produced. If the enemy has circulated a falsehood, they
   have unwisely aggravated us into life, and if they have told us the truth,
   they have unintentionally done us a service. We were returning with folded
   arms from the fatigues of war, and thinking and sitting leisurely down to
   enjoy repose. The dependence that has been put upon Charleston threw a
   drowsiness over America. We looked on the business done- the conflict
   over- the matter settled- or that all which remained unfinished would
   follow of itself. In this state of dangerous relaxation, exposed to the
   poisonous infusions of the enemy, and having no common danger to attract
   our attention, we were extinguishing, by stages, the ardor we began with,
   and surrendering by piece-meal the virtue that defended us.

   Afflicting as the loss of Charleston may be, yet if it universally rouse
   us from the slumber of twelve months past, and renew in us the spirit of
   former days, it will produce an advantage more important than its loss.
   America ever is what she thinks herself to be. Governed by sentiment, and
   acting her own mind, she becomes, as she pleases, the victor or the
   victim.

   It is not the conquest of towns, nor the accidental capture of garrisons,
   that can reduce a country so extensive as this. The sufferings of one part
   can never be relieved by the exertions of another, and there is no
   situation the enemy can be placed in that does not afford to us the same
   advantages which he seeks himself. By dividing his force, he leaves every
   post attackable. It is a mode of war that carries with it a confession of
   weakness, and goes on the principle of distress rather than conquest.

   The decline of the enemy is visible, not only in their operations, but in
   their plans; Charleston originally made but a secondary object in the
   system of attack, and it is now become their principal one, because they
   have not been able to succeed elsewhere. It would have carried a cowardly
   appearance in Europe had they formed their grand expedition, in 1776,
   against a part of the continent where there was no army, or not a
   sufficient one to oppose them; but failing year after year in their
   impressions here, and to the eastward and northward, they deserted their
   capital design, and prudently contenting themselves with what they can
   get, give a flourish of honor to conceal disgrace.

   But this piece-meal work is not conquering the continent. It is a
   discredit in them to attempt it, and in us to suffer it. It is now full
   time to put an end to a war of aggravations, which, on one side, has no
   possible object, and on the other has every inducement which honor,
   interest, safety and happiness can inspire. If we suffer them much longer
   to remain among us, we shall become as bad as themselves. An association
   of vice will reduce us more than the sword. A nation hardened in the
   practice of iniquity knows better how to profit by it, than a young
   country newly corrupted. We are not a match for them in the line of
   advantageous guilt, nor they for us on the principles which we bravely set
   out with. Our first days were our days of honor. They have marked the
   character of America wherever the story of her wars are told; and
   convinced of this, we have nothing to do but wisely and unitedly to tread
   the well known track. The progress of a war is often as ruinous to
   individuals, as the issue of it is to a nation; and it is not only
   necessary that our forces be such that we be conquerors in the end, but
   that by timely exertions we be secure in the interim. The present campaign
   will afford an opportunity which has never presented itself before, and
   the preparations for it are equally necessary, whether Charleston stand or
   fall. Suppose the first, it is in that case only a failure of the enemy,
   not a defeat. All the conquest that a besieged town can hope for, is, not
   to be conquered; and compelling an enemy to raise the siege, is to the
   besieged a victory. But there must be a probability amounting almost to a
   certainty, that would justify a garrison marching out to attack a retreat.
   Therefore should Charleston not be taken, and the enemy abandon the siege,
   every other part of the continent should prepare to meet them; and, on the
   contrary, should it be taken, the same preparations are necessary to
   balance the loss, and put ourselves in a position to co-operate with our
   allies, immediately on their arrival.

   We are not now fighting our battles alone, as we were in 1776; England,
   from a malicious disposition to America, has not only not declared war
   against France and Spain, but, the better to prosecute her passions here,
   has afforded those powers no military object, and avoids them, to distress
   us. She will suffer her West India islands to be overrun by France, and
   her southern settlements to be taken by Spain, rather than quit the object
   that gratifies her revenge. This conduct, on the part of Britain, has
   pointed out the propriety of France sending a naval and land force to
   co-operate with America on the spot. Their arrival cannot be very distant,
   nor the ravages of the enemy long. The recruiting the army, and procuring
   the supplies, are the two things most necessary to be accomplished, and a
   capture of either of the enemy's divisions will restore to America peace
   and plenty.

   At a crisis, big, like the present, with expectation and events, the whole
   country is called to unanimity and exertion. Not an ability ought now to
   sleep, that can produce but a mite to the general good, nor even a whisper
   to pass that militates against it. The necessity of the case, and the
   importance of the consequences, admit no delay from a friend, no apology
   from an enemy. To spare now, would be the height of extravagance, and to
   consult present ease, would be to sacrifice it perhaps forever.

   America, rich in patriotism and produce, can want neither men nor
   supplies, when a serious necessity calls them forth. The slow operation of
   taxes, owing to the extensiveness of collection, and their depreciated
   value before they arrived in the treasury, have, in many instances, thrown
   a burden upon government, which has been artfully interpreted by the enemy
   into a general decline throughout the country. Yet this, inconvenient as
   it may at first appear, is not only remediable, but may be turned to an
   immediate advantage; for it makes no real difference, whether a certain
   number of men, or company of militia (and in this country every man is a
   militia-man), are directed by law to send a recruit at their own expense,
   or whether a tax is laid on them for that purpose, and the man hired by
   government afterwards. The first, if there is any difference, is both
   cheapest and best, because it saves the expense which would attend
   collecting it as a tax, and brings the man sooner into the field than the
   modes of recruiting formerly used; and, on this principle, a law has been
   passed in this state, for recruiting two men from each company of militia,
   which will add upwards of a thousand to the force of the country.

   But the flame which has broken forth in this city since the report from
   New York, of the loss of Charleston, not only does honor to the place,
   but, like the blaze of 1776, will kindle into action the scattered sparks
   throughout America. The valor of a country may be learned by the bravery
   of its soldiery, and the general cast of its inhabitants, but confidence
   of success is best discovered by the active measures pursued by men of
   property; and when the spirit of enterprise becomes so universal as to act
   at once on all ranks of men, a war may then, and not till then, be styled
   truly popular.

   In 1776, the ardor of the enterprising part was considerably checked by
   the real revolt of some, and the coolness of others. But in the present
   case, there is a firmness in the substance and property of the country to
   the public cause. An association has been entered into by the merchants,
   tradesmen, and principal inhabitants of the city [Philadelphia], to
   receive and support the new state money at the value of gold and silver; a
   measure which, while it does them honor, will likewise contribute to their
   interest, by rendering the operations of the campaign convenient and
   effectual.

   Nor has the spirit of exertion stopped here. A voluntary subscription is
   likewise begun, to raise a fund of hard money, to be given as bounties, to
   fill up the full quota of the Pennsylvania line. It has been the remark of
   the enemy, that every thing in America has been done by the force of
   government; but when she sees individuals throwing in their voluntary aid,
   and facilitating the public measures in concert with the established
   powers of the country, it will convince her that the cause of America
   stands not on the will of a few but on the broad foundation of property
   and popularity.

   Thus aided and thus supported, disaffection will decline, and the withered
   head of tyranny expire in America. The ravages of the enemy will be short
   and limited, and like all their former ones, will produce a victory over
   themselves.

   COMMON SENSE.

   PHILADELPHIA, June 9, 1780.

   P. S. At the time of writing this number of the Crisis, the loss of
   Charleston, though believed by some, was more confidently disbelieved by
   others. But there ought to be no longer a doubt upon the matter.
   Charleston is gone, and I believe for the want of a sufficient supply of
   provisions. The man that does not now feel for the honor of the best and
   noblest cause that ever a country engaged in, and exert himself
   accordingly, is no longer worthy of a peaceable residence among a people
   determined to be free.
