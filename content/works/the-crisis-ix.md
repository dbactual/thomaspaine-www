   THE CRISIS, No. IX.
   
   from the *Pennsylvania Packet*, June 13, 1780.
   
   HAD America pursued her advantages with half the spirit that she resisted
   her misfortunes, she would, before now, have been a conquering and a
   peaceful people; but lulled in the lap of soft tranquillity, she rested on
   her hopes, and adversity only has convulsed her into action. Whether
   subtlety or sincerity at the close of the last year, induced the enemy to
   an appearance for peace, is a point not material to know; it is sufficient
   that we see the effects it has had on our politics, and that we sternly
   rise to resent the delusion.

   The war on the part of America, has been a war of natural feelings. Brave
   in distress; serene in conquest; drowsy when at rest; and in every
   situation generously disposed to peace. A dangerous calm, and a most
   heightened zeal, have, as circumstances varied, succeeded each other. Every
   passion, but that of despair, has been called to a tour of duty; and so
   mistaken has been the enemy of our abilities and disposition, that when
   she supposed us conquered, we rose the conquerors. The extensiveness of
   the United States and the variety of their resources; the universality of
   their cause, the quick operation of their feelings, and the similarity of
   their sentiments, have, in every trying situation, produced a *something*,
   which favoured by Providence, and pursued with ardour, has accomplished in
   an instant the business of a campaign. We have never deliberately sought
   victory, but snatched it; and bravely undone in an hour, the plotted
   operations of a season.

   The reported fate of Charlestown, like the misfortunes of sevnety-six, has at last
   called forth a spirit, and kindled up a flame, which perhaps no other
   event could have produced. If the enemy has circulated a falsehood, they
   have unwisely aggravated us into life, and if they have told us the truth,
   they have unintentionally done us a service. We were returning with folded
   arms from the fatigues of war and thinking, and sitting leisurely down to
   enjoy repose. The dependence that has been put upon Charlestown threw a
   drowsiness over America. We looked on the business done &mdash; the conflict
   over &mdash; the matter settled &mdash; or that all which remained unfinished would
   follow of itself. In this state of dangerous relax, exposed to the
   poisonous infusions of the enemy, and having no common danger to attract
   our attention, we were extinguishing by stages, the ardour we began with,
   and surrendering by peacemeals the virtue that defended us.

   Afflicting as the loss of Charlestown may be, yet if it universally rouse
   us from the slumber of twelve months past, and renew in us the spirit of
   former days, it will produce an advantage more important than its loss.
   America ever *is* what she *thinks* herself to be. Governed by sentiment, and
   acting her own mind, she becomes, as she pleases, the victor or the
   victim.

   It is not the conquest of towns, nor the accidental capture of garrisons,
   that can reduce a country so extensive as this. The sufferings of one part
   can never be relieved by the exertions of another, and there is no
   situation the enemy can be in, that does not afford to us, the same
   advantages she seeks herself. By dividing her force, he leaves every
   post attackable. It is a mode of war, that carries with it a confession of
   weakness, and goes on the principle of distress, rather than conquest.

   The decline of the enemy is visible not only in their operations but in
   their plans; Charlestown originally made but a secondary object in the
   system of attack, and it is now become their principal one, because they
   have not been able to succeed else where. It would have carried a cowardly
   appearance in Europe, had they formed their grand expedition in seventy-six,
   against a part of the Continent, where there was no army, or not a
   sufficient one to oppose them; but failing year after year, in their
   impression here, and to the eastward and northward, they deserted their
   capital design, and prudently contenting themselves with what they can
   get, give a flourish of honor to conceal disgrace.

   But this piece meal work is not conquering the Continent. It is a
   discredit in them to attempt it, and in us to suffer it. It is now full
   time to put an end to a war of aggravations, which, on one side, has no
   possible object, and on the other has every inducement which honor,
   interest, safety and happiness, can inspire. If we suffer them much longer
   to remain among us, we shall become as bad as themselves. An association
   of vice will reduce us more than the sword. A nation hardened in the
   practice of iniquity, knows better how to profit by it, than a young
   country newly corrupted. We are not a match for them in the line of
   advantageous guilt, nor they to us, on the principles which we bravely set
   out with. Our first days were our days of honor. They have marked the
   character of America wherever the story of her wars are told; and
   convinced of this, we have nothing to do but wisely and unitedly to tread
   the well known track. 
   
   The progress of a war, is often as ruinous to
   individuals, as the issue of it is to a nation; and it is not only
   necessary that our forces be such, that we be conquerors in the end, but
   that by timely exertions, we be secure in the interim. The present campaign
   will afford an opportunity which has never presented itself before, and
   the preparations for it, are equally necessary, whether Charles twon stand or
   fall. Suppose the first, it is in that case, only a failure of the enemy,
   not a defeat. All the conquest that a besieged town can hope for, is, not
   to be conquered; and compelling an enemy to raise the siege, is to the
   besieged a victory. But there must be a probability amounting almost to a
   certainty, that would justify a garrison marching out to attack a retreat.
   Therefore should Charlestown *not* be taken, and the enemy abandon the siege,
   every other part of the Continent should prepare to meet them; and on the
   contrary, *should it be taken*, the same preparations are necessary, to
   balance the loss, and put ourselves in a condition to co-operate with our
   allies, immediately on their arrival.

   We are not now fighting our battles alone, as we were in seventy-six. England,
   from a malicious disposition to America, has *not* only not declared war
   against France and Spain, but the better to prosecute her passions here,
   has afforded those powers no military object, and avoids them, to distress
   us. She will suffer her West-India Islands to be over run by France, and
   her southern settlements taken by Spain, rather than quit the object
   that gratifies revenge. This conduct, on the part of Britain, has
   pointed out the propriety of France sending a naval and land force to
   co-operate with America on the spot. Their arrival cannot be very distant,
   nor the ravages of the enemy long. In the mean time the part necessary to us, needs 
   no illustration. The recruiting the army, and procuring
   the supplies, are the two things needful, and a
   capture of either of the enemy's divisions, will restore to America peace
   and plenty.

   At a Crisis, big, like the present, with expectation and events, the whole
   country is called to unanimity and exertion. Not an ability ought now to
   sleep, that can produce but a mite to the general good, nor even a whisper
   to pass that militates against it. The necessity of the case, and the
   importance of the consequences, admit no delay from a friend, no apology
   from an enemy. To spare now, would be the height of extravagance, and to
   consult present ease, would be to sacrifice it, perhaps, for ever.

   America, rich in patriotism and produce, can want neither men nor
   supplies, when a serious necessity calls them forth. The slow operation of
   taxes, owing to the extensiveness of collection, and their depreciated
   value before they arrived in the Treasury, have, in many instances, thrown
   a burthen upon Government, which has been artfully interpreted by the enemy
   into a general decline throughout the country. Yet this, inconvenient as
   it may at first appear, is not only remediable, but may be turned to an
   immediate advantage; for it makes no real difference, whether a certain
   number of men, or company of militia, (and in this country every man is a
   militia man) are directed by law, to send a recruit at their own expense,
   or whether a tax is laid on them for that purpose, and the man hired by
   government afterwards. The first, if there is any difference, is both
   cheapest and best, because it saves the expense which would attend
   collecting it as a tax, and brings the man sooner into the field than the
   modes of recruiting formerly used: And on this principle, a law has been
   passed in this State, for recruiting two men from each company of militia,
   which will add upwards of a thousand to the force of the country.

   But the flame, which has broken forth in this city, since the report from
   New-York, of the loss of Charlestown, not only does honor to the place,
   but, like the blaze of seventy-six, will kindle into action, the scattered sparks
   throughout America. The valour of a country may be learned by the bravery
   of its soldiery, and the general cast of its inhabitants, but confidence
   of success is best discovered by the active measures pursued by men of
   property; and when the spirit of enterprize becomes so universal, as to act
   at once on all ranks of men, a war may then, and not till then, be stiled
   truly popular.

   In seventy-six the ardour of the enterprising part was considerably checked by
   the real revolt of some, and the coolness of others. But in the present
   case there is a firmness in the substance and property of the country to
   the public cause. An association has been entered into by the merchants,
   tradesmen, and principal inhabitants of the city, to
   receive and support the new State money at the value of gold and silver; a
   measure, which, while it does them honour, will likewise contribute to their
   interest, by rendering the operations of the campaign convenient and
   effectual.

   Nor has the spirit of exertion stopt here. A voluntary subscription is
   likewise began to raise a fund of hard money, to be given as bounties to
   fill up the full quota of the Pennsylvania line. It has been the remark of
   the enemy, that every thing in America has been done by the force of
   government; but when she sees individuals throwing in their voluntary aids,
   and facilitating the public measures in concert with the established
   powers of the country, it will convince her that the cause of America
   stands not on the will of a few but on the broad foundation of property
   and popularity.

   Thus aided and thus supported, disaffection will decline, and the withered
   head of tyranny expire in America. The ravages of the enemy will be short
   and limited, and like all their former ones, will produce a victory over
   themselves.

   COMMON SENSE.
   
   Philadelphia, June 9, 1780.  

   P. S. At the time of writing this number of the Crisis, the loss of
   Charlestwon, though believed by some, was more confidently disbelieved by
   others. But there ought to be no longer a doubt upon the matter.
   Charlestown is gone, and I believe for the want of a sufficient supply of
   provisions. The man that does not now feel for the honor of the best and
   noblest cause that ever a country engaged in and exert himself
   accordingly, is no longer worthy of a peaceable residence among a people
   determined to be free.
