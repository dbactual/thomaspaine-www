   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   New Rochelle (N.Y.) April 20 1805

   Dear Sir

   I wrote you on 1st Janry from N Rochelle mentioning my intention of
   spending part of the Winter at Washington; but the severity of the Winter
   and the bad condition of the roads and rivers prevented me and I stayed at
   N. York. I wrote you from that place a second letter of more than nine
   pages on a variety of subjects accompanied with a Hamburgh Gazette and a
   letter from a revolutionary sergeant at Kentucky. On the 10th February
   which I judge was about a fortnight after my second letter was sent. I
   recd a letter from you of the *fifteenth Janry* acknowledging the
   receipt of my first letter of Jany 1st  but of the second letter
   enclosing the Hamburgh Gazette and also proposals from a Hamburgh merchant
   to bring German redemptioners to New Orleans I have heard nothing. I did
   not put the letter into the post office myself but I sent it by a friend
   who assures me he delivered it.

   The enclosed half sheet marked No. 1 is part of a letter which I began the
   latter part of last summer but as I then intended to make further
   experiments I suspended finishing it, for I do not permit the *whole* of my
   mind, nor ever did, to be engaged or absorbed by one object only. When I
   was in france and in England since the year 1787, I carried on my
   political productions, religious publications, and mechanical operations
   all at the same time, without permitting one to disturb or interfere with
   the other. 
   
   The piece No. 2 is part of a third letter which I began after
   the receipt of yours of Janry 15th. This confusion and interference of
   dates arise from the uncertainty I am in with respect to the fate of my
   second letter.

   I intend continuing my letters addressed *To the Citizens of the United
   States.* The last, No. 7, published the summer before the last was chiefly
   on the Affairs of New Orleans. I distinguish those letters from others of
   a less public Character, as the remarks on Gouverneur Morris's funeral
   Oration on Hamilton. That on the Ana Memorial, & the piece to Hulbert.

   The reflections which Hulbert threw out with respect to your letter to Mr.
   Dawson arose from some half equivocal qualifying paragraphs which appeared
   I believe in the National Intelligencer before my arrival. Dr. Eustis
   wrote me from Washington more than two years ago. "Those paragraphs and
   which are supposed to be under Mr. Jefferson's direction, have embarrassed
   Mr. Jefferson's friends in Massachusetts. They appeared like a half denial
   of the letter or as if there was something in it not proper to be owned,
   or that needed an apology." &mdash; I was most offended by one which I saw while
   in Paris and which determined me not to come by a national ship. It was
   copied from the National Intelligencer, a Baltimore federal paper and
   introduced into that paper with the words in capitals "Out at Last." It
   owned the receipt of a letter from me in which I pressed a wish to return
   by a national ship and the paragraph concluded thus - "*permission was
   given*," as if the giving it was an Act of Charity, or of great
   diversion at least had the appearance of apologizing. Hulbert introduced the
   subject of the letter by way of convicting you of something you had appeared to 
   disown, or given cause to your friends to disown. I have given Hulbert the
   (illegible) he deserved, and you the credit the letter merits, but had no 
   equivocation been made about the letter Hulbert could not have made the use of it
   he did.

   Yours in friendship

   Thomas Paine
   
   Thomas Jefferson
   
   President of the United States
