   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.
   
   Sept. 28. 1785
   
   Sir

   I enclose an account of the monies due me in the depreciation of my salary
   while Secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs. &mdash; It is prior to the
   time to which the resolve of Congress for making up the depreciation in
   the Civil List extends, but if Congress will attend to the motives of my
   Resignation &mdash; which the Committee (Mr. Gerry Mr. King and Mr. Petit) can
   explain there is, I conceive, every reason of justice and honor that the
   account should be discharged.
   
   A am y. Excellency's Ob. Hbl. Ser. T. PAINE.
