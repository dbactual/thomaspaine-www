   To the Congress of the United States  September 28, 1785

   I enclose an account of the monies due me in the depreciation of my salary
   while Secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs. It is prior to the
   time to which the resolve of Congress for making up the depreciation in
   the Civil List extends, but if Congress will attend to the motives of my
   resignation, which the Committee (Mr. Gerry, Mr. King and Mr. Pates) can
   obtain there is I conceive every reason of justice and honor that the
   account should be discharged.

   T. PAINE.
