   To Thomas Jefferson February 26th, 1789 & March 12, 1789

   No. 13 BROAD STREET BUILDINGS

   DEAR SIR:

   A few days ago I received a letter from Mr. Foljambe in which he says "I
   saw the Rib of your Bridge. In point of elegance and beauty it far
   exceeded my expectations, and is certainly beyond anything I ever saw."

   My model and myself had many visitors while I was at the works. A few days
   after I got there, Lord Fitzwilliams, heir to the Marquis of Rockingham,
   came with Mr. [Edmund] Burke, and the former gave the workmen five
   guineas, and invited me to Wentworth House, a few miles distant from the
   works, where I went, and stayed a few days.

   The bridge I expect will bring forth something greater, but in the
   meantime I feel like a bird from its nest, and wishing most anxiously to
   return; therefore as soon as I can bring anything to bear I shall dispose
   of the contract and bid adieu. I can very truly say that my mind is not at
   home.

   I am very much rejoiced at the account you give me of the state of affairs
   in France. I feel exceedingly interested in the happiness of that nation.
   They are now got, or getting, into the right way, and the present reign
   will be more immortalized in France than any that ever preceded it; they
   have all died away, forgotten in the common mass of things, but this will
   be to France an Anno Mundi, or an Anno Domini.

   The happiness of doing good, and the pride of doing great things, unite
   themselves in this business. But as there are two kinds of pride, the
   little and the great, the-privileged orders will in some degree be
   governed by this division. Those of little pride (I mean little-minded
   pride) will be schismatical, and those of great pride will be orthodox
   with respect to the States General. Interest will likewise have some
   share, and could this operate fully and freely it would arrange itself on
   the orthodox side. To enrich a nation is to enrich the individuals which
   compose it. To enrich the farmer is to enrich the farm-and consequently
   the landlord;-for whatever the farmer is the farm will be. The richer the
   subject, the richer the revenue, because the consumption from which taxes
   are raised are in proportion to the abilities of people to consume;
   therefore the most effectual method to raise both the revenue and the
   rental of a country is to raise the condition of the people, or that order
   known in France by the Tiers Etat [Third Estate]. But I ought to ask
   pardon for entering into reasoning in a letter to you. I only do it
   because I like the subject.

   I observe in all the companies I go into the impression which the present
   circumstances of France have upon this country. An internal alliance
   [between the King and the people] in France is an alliance which England
   never dreamed of, and which she most dreads. Whether she will be better or
   worse tempered afterwards I cannot judge of, but I believe she will be
   more cautious in giving offense. She is likewise impressed with an idea
   that a negotiation is on foot between the King [Louis XVI] and the Emperor
   [of Germany] for adding Austrian Flanders to France.

   This appears to me such a probable thing, and may be rendered [so]
   conducive to the interest of all parties concerned, that I am inclined to
   give it credit and wish it success. I hope then to see the Scheldt opened,
   for it is a sin to refuse the bounties of nature. On these matters I shall
   be glad of your opinion. I think the States General of Holland could not
   be in earnest when they applied to France for the payment of the quota to
   the Emperor. All things considered, to request it was meanness and to
   expect it absurdity. I am more inclined to think they made it an
   opportunity to find how they stood with France. Absalom (I think it was)
   set fire to his brother's field of corn to bring on a conversation.

   March 12th. With respect to political matters here the truth is the people
   are fools. They have no discernment into principles and consequences. Had
   Mr. Pitt proposed a national convention at the time of the King's
   insanity, he had done right; but instead of this he has absorbed the right
   of the nation into a right of Parliament-one house of which (the Peers) is
   hereditary in its own right, and over which the people have no control
   (not as much as they have over their King); and the other elective by only
   a small part of the nation. Therefore he has lessened instead of increased
   the rights of the people; but as they have not sense enough to see it,
   they have been huzzaing him. There can be no fixed principles of
   government, or anything like a Constitution, in a country where the
   government can alter itself, or one part of it supply the other.

   Whether a man that has been so completely mad as not to be managed but by
   force and the mad shirt can ever be confided in afterwards as a reasonable
   man, is a matter I have very little opinion of. Such a circumstance, in my
   estimation, if mentioned, ought to be a perpetual disqualification.

   The emperor I am told has entered a caveat against the Elector of Hanover
   (not the electoral vote) for king of the Romans. John Bull, however, is
   not so mad as he was, and a message has been manufactured for him to
   Parliament in which there is nothing particular. The treaty with Prussia
   is not yet before Parliament but is to be.

   Had the regency gone on and the new administration been formed I should
   have been able to communicate some matters of business to you, both with
   respect to America and France; as an interview for that purpose was agreed
   upon and to take place as soon as the persons who were to fill the offices
   should succeed. I am the more confidential with those persons, as they are
   distinguished by the name of the Blue and Buff- a dress taken up during
   the American war, and the undress uniform of General Washington with
   lapels, which they still wear. But at any rate I do not think it worth
   while for Congress to appoint any minister to this Court.

   The greater distance Congress observes on this point, the better. It will
   be all money thrown away to go to any expense about it-at least during the
   present reign. I know the nation well, and the line of acquaintance I am
   in enables me to judge better than any other American can judge,
   especially at a distance. If Congress should have any business to state to
   the government here, it can be easily done through their Minister at
   Paris; but the seldomer the better.

   I believe I am not so much in the good graces of the Marquis of Lansdowne
   as I used to be. I do not answer his purpose. He was always talking of a
   sort of reconnection of England and America, and my coldness and reserve
   on this subject checked communication. I believed he would be a good
   Minister for England with respect to a better agreement with France.

   Should anything occur worth communicating, while I am here and you in
   France, I will inform you of it. If nothing comes to you, you may conclude
   there is nothing and that matters stand as at the time of writing this
   letter. As soon as the weather will permit which is still very cold and
   uncomfortable, I shall set off for the iron works. I received a letter
   this morning from the Proprietors informing me that Sir Thomas Blackat was
   to dine with them and to see our pontifical works, as he wanted a bridge
   on his estate. Mr. Rumsey called at my lodgings last evening (but I was
   out) to inform me of his immediately setting off for France. In case he
   should not set off till this evening this letter will be presented to you
   by him. He appears to me perfectly master of the subject of steam, and is
   a very agreeable man. I am now going to the other end of the town to
   inquire after him.

   Remember me to the Marquis de Lafayette, Mr. Le Roy, Mr. De Corney. Please
   to inform me if anything further has been done about the bridge; and
   likewise how the new bridge in your neighborhood goes on.

   I am, dear sir, with much respect, Your sincere friend, and obedient

   humble servant

   THOMAS PAINE.
