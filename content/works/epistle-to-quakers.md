   Philip Foner's introduction:

   On January 20, 1776, at a general meeting of the Pennsylvania and New
   Jersey Quakers, a document was adopted and address issued to the people of
   America which placed the Quakers squarely on the Tory side. It was against
   this stand that Paine wrote his Epistle to the Quakers in which he accused
   that "factional and fractional part" of the whole body of Quakers which
   had published the address, of being traitors to their own principles. He
   did not, however, condemn all Quakers, for he was quite aware that many
   Quakers supported the American cause. For an analysis of the background
   leading to the writing of the Epistle, see Robert P. Falk, "Thomas Paine
   and the Attitude of the Quakers to the American Revolution," in
   Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, vol. LXIII, July, 1939,
   pp. 302-310. Paine's Epistle was part of the Appendix to the third edition
   of Common Sense.

   TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OF THE PEOPLE CALLED
   QUAKERS, OR TO SO MANY OF THEM AS WERE CONCERNED IN PUBLISHING A LATE
   PIECE, ENTITLED "The Ancient Testimony and Principles OF THE PEOPLE CALLED
   Quakers RENEWED, WITH RESPECT TO THE King AND Government, AND TOUCHING THE
   Commotions NOW PREVAILING IN THESE AND OTHER PARTS OF America, ADDRESSED
   TO THE People in General."

   THE writer of this is one of those few who never dishonors religion either
   by ridiculing or cavilling at any denomination whatsoever. To God, and not
   to man, are all men accountable on the score of religion. Wherefore, this
   epistle is not so properly addressed to you as a religious, but as a
   political body, dabbling in matters which the professed quietude of your
   principles instruct you not to meddle with. As you have, without a proper
   authority for so doing, put yourselves in the place of the whole body of
   the Quakers, so the writer of this, in order to be in an equal rank with
   yourselves, is under the necessity of putting himself in the place of all
   those who approve the very writings and principles against which your
   testimony is directed: And he hath chosen this singular situation, in
   order that you might discover in him that presumption of character which
   you cannot see in yourselves. For neither he nor you have any claim or
   title to political representation.

   When men have departed from the right way, it is no wonder that they
   stumble and fall. And it is evident from the manner in which you have
   managed your testimony, that politics (as a religious body of men) is not
   your proper walk; for however well adapted it might appear to you, it is,
   nevertheless, a jumble of good and bad unwisely put together, and the
   conclusion drawn therefrom both unnatural and unjust.

   The first two pages (and the whole makes but four) we give you credit for,
   and expect the same civility from you, because the love and desire of
   peace is not confined to Quakerism, it is the natural as well as the
   religious wish of all denominations of men. And on this ground, as men
   laboring to establish an independent Constitution of our own, do we exceed
   all others in our hope, end, and aim. Our plan is peace for ever. We are
   tired of contention with Britain, and can see no real end to it but in a
   final separation. We act consistently, because for the sake of introducing
   an endless and uninterrupted peace, do we bear the evils and the burdens
   of the present day. We are endeavoring, and will steadily continue to
   endeavor, to separate and dissolve a connection which has already filled
   our land with blood; and which, while the name of it remains, will be the
   fatal cause of future mischiefs to both countries.

   We fight neither for revenge nor conquest; neither from pride nor passion;
   we are not insulting the world with our fleets and armies, nor ravaging
   the globe for plunder. Beneath the shade of our own vines are we attacked;
   in our own houses, and on our own lands, is the violence committed against
   us. We view our enemies in the characters of highwaymen and housebreakers,
   and having no defence for ourselves in the civil law, are obliged to
   punish them by the military one, and apply the sword, in the very case
   where you have before now applied the halter. Perhaps we feel for the
   ruined and insulted sufferers in all and every part of the continent, with
   a degree of tenderness which hath not yet made its way into some of your
   bosoms. But be ye sure that ye mistake not the cause and ground of your
   testimony. Call not coldness; of soul, religion; nor put the bigot in the
   place of the Christian.

   O ye partial ministers of your own acknowledged principles. If the bearing
   arms be sinful, the first going to war must be more so, by all the
   difference between willful attack and unavoidable defence. Wherefore, if
   you really preach from conscience, and mean not to make a political
   hobby-horse of your religion, convince the world thereof, by proclaiming
   your doctrine to our enemies, for they likewise bear ARMS. Give us proof
   of your sincerity, by publishing it at St. James's, to the commanders in
   chief at Boston, to the admirals and captains who are piratically ravaging
   our coasts, and to all the murdering miscreants who are acting in
   authority under HIM whom ye profess to serve. Had ye the honest soul of
   Barclay1 ye would preach repentance to your king: ye would tell the royal
   wretch his sins, and warn him of eternal ruin. Ye would not spend your
   partial invectives against the injured and insulted only, but, like
   faithful ministers, would cry aloud and spare none. Say not that ye are
   persecuted, neither endeavor to make us the authors of that reproach which
   ye are bringing upon yourselves; for we testify unto all men, that we do
   not complain against you because ye are Quakers, but because ye pretend to
   be and are not Quakers.

   Alas! it seems by the particular tendency of some part of your testimony,
   and other parts of your conduct, as if all sin was reduced to, and
   comprehended in, the act of bearing arms, and that by the people only. Ye
   appear to us to have mistaken party for conscience; because the general
   tenor of your actions wants uniformity. And it is exceedingly difficult
   for us to give credit to many of your pretended scruples; because we see
   them made by the same men, who, in the very instant that they are
   exclaiming against the mammon of this world, are nevertheless hunting
   after it with a step as steady as time, and an appetite as keen as death.

   The quotation which ye have made from Proverbs, in the third page of your
   testimony, that "when a man's way please the Lord, he maketh even his
   enemies to be at peace with him"; is very unwisely chosen on your part;
   because it amounts to a proof that the king's ways (whom ye are so
   desirous of supporting) do not please the Lord, otherwise his reign would
   be in peace.

   I now proceed to the latter part of your testimony, and that for which all
   the foregoing seems only an introduction, viz.

   "It hath ever been our judgment and principle, since we were called to
   profess the light of Christ Jesus, manifested in our consciences unto this
   day, that the setting up and putting down king's and governments, is God's
   peculiar prerogative; for causes best known to himself: And that it is not
   our business to have any hand or contrivance therein; nor to be busy
   bodies above our station, much less to plot and contrive the ruin, or
   overturn of any of them, but to pray for the king, and safety of our
   nation, and good of all men: That we may live a quiet and peaceable life,
   in all godliness and honesty; under the government which God is pleased to
   set over us."

   If these are really your principles why do ye not abide by them? Why do ye
   not leave that, which ye call God's work, to be managed by himself? These
   very principles instruct you to wait with patience and humility, for the
   event of all public measures, and to receive that event as the divine will
   towards you. Wherefore, what occasion is there for your political
   testimony, if you fully believe what it contains? And the very publishing
   it proves that either you do not believe what you profess, or have not
   virtue enough to practice what you believe.

   The principles of Quakerism have a direct tendency to make a man the quiet
   and inoffensive subject of any, and every government which is set over
   him. And if the setting up and putting down of kings and governments is
   God's peculiar prerogative, he most certainly will not be robbed thereof
   by us; wherefore, the principle itself leads you to approve of every thing
   which ever happened, or may happen to kings, as being his work. Oliver
   Cromwell thanks you. Charles, then, died not by the hands of man; and
   should the present proud imitator of him come to the same untimely end,
   the writers and publishers of the testimony are bound, by the doctrine it
   contains, to applaud the fact. Kings are not taken away by miracles,
   neither are changes in governments brought about by any other means than
   such as are common and human; and such as we now are using. Even the
   dispersing of the Jews, though foretold by our Saviour, was effected by
   arms. Wherefore, as ye refuse to be the means on one side, ye ought not to
   be meddlers on the other; but to wait the issue in silence; and, unless
   you can produce divine authority to prove that the Almighty, who hath
   created and placed this new world at the greatest distance it could
   possibly stand, east and west, from every part of the old, doth,
   nevertheless, disapprove of its being independent of the corrupt and
   abandoned court of Britain; unless, I say, ye can show this, how can ye,
   on the ground of your principles, justify the exciting and stirring up the
   people "firmly to unite in the abhorrence of all such writings, and
   measures, as evidence a desire and design to break off the happy
   connection we have hitherto enjoyed with the kingdom of Great Britain, and
   our just and necessary subordination to the king, and those who are
   lawfully placed in authority under him." What a slap in the face is here!
   The men, who, in the very paragraph before, have quietly and passively
   resigned up the ordering, altering and disposal of kings and governments,
   into the hands of God, are now recalling their principles, and putting in
   for a share of the business. Is it possible, that the conclusion, which is
   here justly quoted, can any ways follow from the doctrine laid down! The
   inconsistency is too glaring not to be seen; the absurdity too great not
   to be laughed at; and such as could only have been made by those whose
   understandings were darkened by the narrow and crabbed spirit of a
   despairing political party; for ye are not to be considered as the whole
   body of the Quakers, but only as a factional and fractional part thereof.

   Here ends the examination of your Testimony; (which I call upon no man to
   abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly;) to which I
   subjoin the following remark "That the setting up and putting down of
   kings" must certainly mean, the making him a king who is yet not so, and
   the making him no king who is already one. And pray what hath this to do
   in the present case? We neither mean to set up nor to pull down, neither
   to make nor to unmake, but to have nothing to do with them. Wherefore,
   your testimony, in whatever light it is viewed, serves only to dishonor
   your judgment, and for many other reasons had better have been let alone
   than published.

   First, Because it tends to the decrease and reproach of all religion
   whatever, and is of the utmost danger to society, to make it a party in
   political disputes.

   Secondly, Because it exhibits a body of men, numbers of whom disavow the
   publishing of political testimonies, as being concerned therein and
   approvers thereof.

   Thirdly, Because it hath a tendency to undo that continental harmony and
   friendship which yourselves, by your late liberal and charitable do-
   nations, hath lent a hand to establish; and the preservation of which is
   of the utmost consequence to us all.

   And here, without anger or resentment, I bid you farewell. Sincerely
   wishing, that as men and Christians, ye may always fully and
   uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and religious right, and be, in your
   turn, the means of securing it to others; but that the example which ye
   have unwisely set, of mingling religion with politics, may be disavowed
   and reprobated by every inhabitant of AMERICA.

   1. "Thou hast tasted of prosperity and adversity; thou knowest what it is
   to be banished thy native country, to be over-ruled as well as to rule,
   and sit upon the throne: and being oppressed thou hast reason to know how
   hateful the oppressor is both to God and man; If after all these warnings
   and advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the Lord with alt thy heart,
   but forget him who remembered thee in thy distress, and give up thyself
   to. follow lust and vanity, surely, great will be thy
   condemnation.-Against which snare, as well as the temptation of those who
   may or do feed thee, and prompt thee to evil, the most excellent and
   prevalent remedy will be, to apply thyself to that light of Christ which
   shineth in thy conscience, and which neither can nor will flatter thee,
   nor suffer thee to be at ease in thy sins."-Barclay's Address to Charles
   II.-Author.
