   To Gilbert Wakefield, A.B.  November 19, 1795

   PARIS,

   DEAR SIR:

   When you prudently chose, like a starved apothecary, to offer your
   eighteen penny antidote to those who had taken my two-and-sixpenny
   Bible-purge, you forgot that although my dose was rather of the roughest,
   it might not be the less wholesome for possessing that drastic quality;
   and if I am to judge of its salutary effects on your infuriate polemic
   stomach, by the nasty things it has made you bring away, I think you
   should be the last man alive to take your own panacea. As to the
   collection of words of which you boast the possession, nobody, I believe,
   will dispute their amount, but every one who reads your answer to my Age
   of Reason will wish there were not so many scurrilous ones among them; for
   though they may be very useful in emptying your gall- bladder they are too
   apt to move the bile of other people.

   Those of Greek and Latin are rather foolishly thrown away, I think, on a
   man like me, who, you are pleased to say, is "the greatest ignoramus in
   nature"; yet I must take the liberty to tell you, that wisdom does not
   consist in the mere knowledge of language, but of things.

   You recommend me to know myself, a thing very easy to advise, but very
   difficult to practice, as I learn from your own book; for you take
   yourself to be a meek disciple of Christ, and yet give way to passion and
   pride in every page of its composition.

   You have raised an ant-hill about the roots of my sturdy oak, and it may
   amuse idlers to see your work; but neither its body nor its branches are
   injured by you; and I hope the shade of my Civic Crown may be able to
   preserve your little contrivance, at least for the season.

   When you have done as much service to the world by your writings, and
   suffered as much for them, as I have done, you will be entitled to
   dictate: but although I know you to be a keener politician than Paul, I
   can assure you from my experience of mankind, that you do not much commend
   the Christian doctrines to them by announcing that it requires the labor
   of a learned life to make them understood.

    May I be permitted, after all, to suggest that your truly vigorous
   talents would be best employed in teaching men to preserve their liberties
   exclusively, leaving to that God who made their immortal souls the care of
   their eternal welfare.

   I am, dear Sir, your true well-wisher,

   THO . PAINE.
