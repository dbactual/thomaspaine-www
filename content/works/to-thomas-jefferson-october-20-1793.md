   To Thomas Jefferson  October 20, 1793

   DEAR SIR:

   I wrote you by Captain Dominick who was to sail from Havre about the 20th
   of this month. This will probably be brought you by Mr. [Joel] Barlow or
   Col. Oswald. Since my letter by Dominick I am every day more convinced and
   impressed with the propriety of Congress sending Commissioners to Europe
   to confer with the Ministers of the Jesuitical Powers on the means of
   terminating the war. The enclosed printed paper will show there are a
   variety of subjects to be taken into consideration which did not appear at
   first, all of which have some tendency to put an end to the war. I see not
   how this war is to terminate if some intermediate power does not step
   forward. There is now no prospect that France can carry revolutions
   through Europe on the one hand, or that the combined powers can conquer
   France on the other hand. It is a sort of defensive War on both sides.
   This being the case how is the War to close? Neither side will ask for
   peace though each may wish it. I believe that England and Holland are
   tired of the war. Their Commerce and Manufactures have suffered most
   exceedingly-and besides this it is to them a war without an object. Russia
   keeps herself at a distance. I cannot help repeating my wish that Congress
   would send Commissioners, and I wish also that yourself would venture once
   more across the Ocean as one of them. If the Commissioners rendezvous at
   Holland they would then know what steps to take. They could call Mr.
   Pinckney to their Councils, and it would be of use, on many accounts, that
   one of them should come over from Holland to France. Perhaps a long truce,
   were it proposed by the neutral Powers, would have all the effects of a
   Peace, without the difficulties attending the adjustment of all the forms
   of Peace.

   Yours affectionately,

   THOMAS PAINE.
