   From the original letter at the New-York Historical Society.

   Sept. 9th 1780 &mdash;

   Sir

   Last spring I mentioned to you a wish I had to take a passage for Europe
   and endeavor to get privately to England, you pointed out several
   difficulties in the way respecting my own safety which occasioned me to
   defer the matter at that time in order not only to weigh it more
   seriously but to submit it to the government of subsequent circumstances.

   I have frequently and carefully thought of it since; and were I now to
   give an opinion on that a measure to which I was not a party it would be
   like this: That as the Press in that country is free and open, could a
   person possessed of a knowledge of America and capable of fixing it in
   the minds of the people of England go suddenly from this country to that,
   and keep himself concealed, he might, were he to manage his knowledge
   rightly, produce a more general disposition for peace than by any method I
   can suppose.

   I see my way so clearly before me in this opinion that I must be more
   mistaken than I ever yet was on any political measure if it fails of its
   end. I take it for granted that the whole Country, Ministry, Minority and
   all, are tired of the war, but the difficulty is how to get rid of it or
   how they are to come down from the high ground they have taken and
   accommodate their feelings to a treaty for peace. Such a change must be
   the affect either of necessity or choice. I think it will, at least,
   Take three or four more campaigns to produce the former and they are too wrong
   in their opinions of America to act from the latter. 
   
   I imagine that next spring will begin with a new Parliament which is so material a Crisis in
   the Politics of that Country that it ought to be attended to by this, for
   should it start wrong we may look forward to six or seven years more of
   war.

   The Influence of the press rightly managed is important, but we can derive
   no service in this line because there is no person in England who knows
   enough of America to treat the subject properly. It was in a great measure
   owing to my bringing a knowledge of England with me to America, that I was
   enabled to enter deeper into politics and with more success than other
   people and whoever takes the matter up in England must in like manner be
   possessed of a knowledge of America. I do not suppose that the
   acknowledgment of Independance is at this time a more unpopular Doctrine
   in England than the declaration of it was in America immediately before
   the publication of the pamphlet 'Common Sense' and the ground appears as
   open for the one now as it did for the other then.

   The manner in which I would bring such a publication out would be under
   the Cover of an Englishman who had made the Tour of America incog &mdash; 
   This will afford me all the foundation I wish for and enable me to place
   matters before them in a light in which they have never yet viewed them. I
   observe that Mr. Rose in his speech on Governor Pownals Bill printed in
   Bradfords last paper says that "to form an opinion on the propriety of
   yielding independance to America requires an accurate knowledge of the
   State of that Country, the temper of the People, the resources of their
   government" &c. 
   
   Now there is no other method to give this information a
   national Currency but through the channel of the Press which I have ever
   considered the Tongue of the World and that which governs the sentiments
   of mankind more than anything else that ever did or can exist.

   The simple point I mean to aim at is to make the acknowledgment of
   Independence a popular subject and that not by exposing and attacking
   their errors but by stating its advantages and apologizing for their
   errors by way of accommodating the measure of their Pride &mdash; The present
   parties in that Country will never bring one another to reason, they are
   heated with all the passion of opposition, and to rout the ministry or to
   support them makes their capital point. 
   
   Was the same channel open to the
   ministry in this Country which is open to us in that they would stick at
   no expense to improve the opportunity. Men who are used to government know
   the weight and worth of the Press when in hands which can use it to
   advantage &mdash; 

   Perhaps with me a little degree of literary pride is connected with
   principle &mdash; for as I had a considerable share in promoting the Declaration
   of Independence in this Country I likewise wish to be a means of
   promoting the acknowledgment of it in that; and were I not persuaded that
   the measure I have proposed would be productive of much essential service 
   I would not hazard my own safety, as I have every thing to apprehend should
   I fall into their hands &mdash; but could I escape in Safety till I could get
   out a publication in England my apprehensions would be over because the
   manner in which I mean to treat the subject would procure me protection.

   Having said thus much on the matter I take the liberty of hinting to you
   a mode by which the expence may be defrayed without any new charge &mdash; Drop a
   delegate in Congress at the next election and apply the pay to defray
   what I have proposed &mdash; and the point then will be, whether you can possibly
   put any man into Congress who could render as much service in that station
   as in the one I have pointed out. When you have perused this I should be
   glad of some conversation upon it and will wait on you for that purpose
   at any hour you may appoint. I have changed my Lodgings, and am now in
   Front Street opposite the Coffee, next door to Aitkins Book Store.

   I am Sir your obt hble Servt

   THOMAS PAINE
