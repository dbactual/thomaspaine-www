   To a Member of the Pennsylvania Council  June, 1786

   HONORABLE SIR:

   I have sent to His Excellency, the President [Benjamin Franklin] two
   models for a Bridge, the one of wood, the other of cast-iron bars, to be
   erected over rivers, without piers. As I shall in a few days go to New
   York, and take them with me, I do myself the honor of presenting an
   invitation to Council to take a view of them before they are removed. If
   it is convenient to Council to see and examine their construction today,
   at the usual time of their adjournment, I will attend at the President's
   at half after twelve o'clock, or any other day or hour Council may please
   to appoint.

   THOMAS PAINE.
