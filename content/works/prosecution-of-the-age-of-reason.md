   Philip Foner's introduction:

   The letter which follows the introduction was addressed to Thomas Erskine
   who had defended Paine in the government suit conducted in 1792 to
   suppress Rights of Man, but in 1797 conducted the prosecution of Thomas
   Williams, a London publisher and bookseller, accused by the Society for
   the Suppression of Vice and Immorality with printing a copy of The Age of
   Reason. Williams was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison. His
   sentence was later reduced to one year.

   The pamphlet was published in Paris in September 1797.

   INTRODUCTION

   IT is a matter of surprise to some people to see Mr. Erskine act as
   counsel for a crown prosecution commenced against the rights of opinion. I
   confess it is none to me, notwithstanding all that Mr. Erskine has said
   before; for it is difficult to know when a lawyer is to be believed: I
   have always observed that Mr. Erskine, when contending as counsel for the
   right of political opinion, frequently took occasions, and those often
   dragged in head and shoulders, to lard what he called the British
   Constitution with a great deal of praise.

   Yet the same Mr. Erskine said to me in conversation, "were government to
   begin de novo in England, they never would establish such a damned
   absurdity [it was exactly his expression] as this is." Ought I then to be
   surprised at Mr. Erskine for inconsistency?

   In this prosecution, Mr. Erskine admits the right of controversy; but says
   that the Christian religion is not to be abused. This is somewhat
   sophistical, because, while he admits the right of controversy, he
   reserves the right of calling the controversy abuse; and thus,
   lawyer-like, undoes by one word what he says in the other.

   I will however in this letter keep within the limits he prescribes; he
   will find here nothing about the Christian religion; he will find only a
   statement of a few cases which show the necessity of examining the books
   handed to us from the Jews, in order to discover if we have not been
   imposed upon; together with some observations on the manner in which the
   trial of Williams has been conducted. If Mr. Erskine denies the right of
   examining those books, he had better profess himself at once an advocate
   for the establishment of an inquisition and the re-establishment of the
   Star-chamber.

   THOMAS PAINE.



   A LETTER TO MR. ERSKINE

   OF all the tyrannies that afflict mankind, tyranny in religion is the
   worst. Every other species of tyranny is limited to the world we live in,
   but this attempts a stride beyond the grave and seeks to pursue us into
   eternity. It is there and not here, it is to God and not to man, it is to
   a heavenly and not an earthly tribunal, that we are to account for our
   belief.

   If then we believe falsely and dishonorably of the Creator, and that
   belief is forced upon us, as far as force can operate by human laws and
   human tribunals, on whom is the criminality of that belief to fall; on
   those who impose it, or on those on whom it is imposed?

   A bookseller of the name of Williams has been prosecuted in London on a
   charge of blasphemy for publishing a book entitled "The Age of Reason."
   Blasphemy is a word of vast sound, but of equivocal and almost of
   indefinite signification, unless we confine it to the simple idea of
   hurting or injuring the reputation of any one, which was its original
   meaning. As a word, it existed before Christianity existed, being a Greek
   word, or Greek anglicized, as all the etymological dictionaries will show.

   But behold how various and contradictory has been the signification and
   application of this equivocal word: Socrates, who lived more than four
   hundred years before the Christian era, was convicted of blasphemy for
   preaching against the belief of a plurality of gods, and for preaching the
   belief of one god, and was condemned to suffer death by poison: Jesus
   Christ was convicted of blasphemy under the Jewish law, and was crucified.

   Calling Mahomet an impostor would be blasphemy in Turkey; and denying the
   infallibility of the Pope and the Church would be blasphemy at Rome. What
   then is to be understood by this word blasphemy? We see that in the case
   of Socrates truth was condemned as blasphemy. Are we sure that truth is
   not blasphemy in the present day? Woe however be to those who make it so,
   whoever they may be.

   A book called the Bible has been voted by men, and decreed by human laws,
   to be the Word of God, and the disbelief of this is called blasphemy. But
   if the Bible be not the Word of God, it is the laws and the execution of
   them that is blasphemy, and not the disbelief. Strange stories are told of
   the Creator in that book. He is represented as acting under the influence
   of every human passion, even of the most malignant kind.

   If these stories are false we err in believing them to be true, and ought
   not to believe them. It is therefore a duty which every man owes to
   himself, and reverentially to his Maker, to ascertain, by every possible
   inquiry whether there be a sufficient evidence to believe them or not.

   My own opinion is, decidedly, that the evidence does not warrant the
   belief, and that we sin in forcing that belief upon ourselves and upon
   others. In saying this I have no other object in view than truth. But that
   I may not be accused of resting upon bare assertion, with respect to the
   equivocal state of the Bible, I will produce an example, and I will not
   pick and cull the Bible for the purpose.

   I will go fairly to the case. I will take the first two chapters of
   Genesis as they stand, and show from thence the truth of what I say, that
   is, that the evidence does not warrant the belief that the Bible is the
   Word of God.

   [In the original pamphlet the first two chapters of Genesis are here
   quoted in full.]

   These two chapters are called the Mosaic account of the Creation; and we
   are told, nobody knows by whom, that Moses was instructed by God to write
   that account.

   It has happened that every nation of people has been world-makers; and
   each makes the world to begin his own way, as if they had all been brought
   up, as Hudibras says, to the trade. There are hundreds of different
   opinions and traditions how the world began. My business, however, in this
   place, is only with those two chapters.

   I begin then by saying, that those two chapters, instead of containing, as
   has been believed, one continued account of the Creation, written by
   Moses, contain two different and contradictory stories of a creation made
   by two different persons, and written in two different styles of
   expression. The evidence that shows this is so clear, when attended to
   without prejudice, that did we meet with the same evidence in any Arabic
   or Chinese account of a creation, we should not hesitate in pronouncing it
   a forgery.

   I proceed to distinguish the two stories from each other.

   The first story begins at the first verse of the first chapter and ends at
   the end of the third verse of the second chapter; for the adverbial
   conjunction, THUS, with which the second chapter begins (as the reader
   will see) connects itself to the last verses of the first chapter, and
   those three verses belong to, and make the conclusion of, the first story.

   The second story begins at the fourth verse of the second chapter, and
   ends with that chapter. Those two stories have been confused into one, by
   cutting off the last three verses of the first story, and throwing them to
   the second chapter.

   I go now to show that those stories have been written by two different
   persons.

   From the first verse of the first chapter to the end of the third verse of
   the second chapter, which makes the whole of the first story, the word God
   is used without any epithet or additional word conjoined with it, as the
   reader will see: and this style of expression is invariably used
   throughout the whole of this story, and is repeated no less than
   thirty-five times, viz.: "In the beginning GOD created the heavens and the
   earth, and the spirit of GOD moved on the face of the waters, and GOD
   said, let there be light, and GOD saw the light," etc.

   But immediately from the beginning of the fourth verse of the second
   chapter, where the second story begins, the style of expression is always
   the Lord God, and this style of expression is invariably used to the end
   of the chapter, and is repeated eleven times; in the one it is always GOD,
   and never the Lord God, in the other it is always the Lord God and never
   GOD. The first story contains thirty-four verses, and repeats the single
   word GOD thirty-five times.

   The second story contains twenty-two verses, and repeats the compound word
   Lord God eleven times; this difference of style, so often repeated, and so
   uniformly continued, shows that those two chapters, containing two
   different stories, are written by different persons; it is the same in all
   the different editions of the Bible, in all the languages I have seen.

   Having thus shown, from the difference of style, that those two chapters,
   divided, as they properly divide themselves, at the end of the third verse
   of the second chapter, are the work of two different persons, I come to
   show you, from the contradictory matters they contain, that they cannot be
   the work of one person, and are two different stories.

   It is impossible, unless the writer was a lunatic, without memory, that
   one and the same person could say, as is said in i. 27, 28, "So God
   created man in His Own image, in the image of God created He him; male and
   female created He them: and God blessed them, and God said unto them, be
   fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have
   dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and every
   living thing that moveth on the face of the earth."

   It is, I say, impossible that the same person who said this, could
   afterwards say, as is said in ii. 5, and there was not a man to till the
   ground; and then proceed in verse seven to give another account of the
   making a man for the first time, and afterwards of the making a woman out
   of his rib.

   Again, one and the same person could not write, as is written in i. 29:
   "Behold I (God) have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on the
   face of all the earth; and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree
   bearing seed, to you it shall be for meat"; and afterwards say, as is said
   in the second chapter, that the Lord God planted a tree in the midst of a
   garden, and forbade man to eat thereof.

   Again, one and the same person could not say, "Thus the heavens and the
   earth were finished, and all the host of them, and on the seventh day God
   ended all His work which He had made"; and immediately after set the
   Creator to work again, to plant a garden, to make a man and a woman, etc.,
   as done in the second chapter.

   Here are evidently two different stories contradicting each other.
   According to the first, the two sexes, the male and the female, were made
   at the same time. According to the second, they were made at different
   times; the man first, and the woman afterwards.

   According to the first story, they were to have dominion over all the
   earth. According to the second, their dominion was limited to a garden.
   How large a garden it could be that one man and one woman could dress and
   keep in order, I leave to the prosecutor, the judge, the jury, and Mr.
   Erskine to determine.

   The story of the talking serpent and its tete-a-tete with Eve; the doleful
   adventure called the Fall of Man; and how he was turned out of this fine
   garden, and how the garden was afterwards locked up and guarded by a
   flaming sword (if any one can tell what a flaming sword is), belong
   altogether to the second story. They have no connection with the first
   story. According to the first there was no garden of Eden; no forbidden
   tree: the scene was the whole earth, and the fruit of all trees were
   allowed to be eaten.

   In giving this example of the strange state of the Bible, it cannot be
   said I have gone out of my way to seek it, for I have taken the beginning
   of the book; nor can it be said I have made more of it than it makes of
   itself. That there are two stories is as visible to the eye, when attended
   to, as that there are two chapters, and that they have been written by
   different persons, nobody knows by whom.

   If this then is the strange condition the beginning of the Bible is in it
   leads to a just suspicion that the other parts are no better, and
   consequently it becomes every man's duty to examine the case. I have done
   it for myself, and am satisfied that the Bible is fabulous.

   Perhaps I shall be told in the cant language of the day, as I have often
   been told by the Bishop of Llandaff and others, of the great and laudable
   pains that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the obscure
   and reconcile the contradictory, or as they say the seemingly
   contradictory, passages of the Bible. It is because the Bible needs such
   an undertaking, that is one of the first causes to suspect it is NOT the
   Word of God: this single reflection, when carried home to the mind, is in
   itself a volume.

   What! does not the Creator of the Universe, the Fountain of all Wisdom,
   the Origin of all Science, the Author of all Knowledge, the God of Order
   and of Harmony, know how to write ? When we contemplate the vast economy
   of the creation, when we behold the unerring regularity of the visible
   solar system, the perfection with which all its several parts revolve, and
   by corresponding assemblage form a whole;-when we launch our eye into the
   boundless ocean of space, and see ourselves surrounded by innumerable
   words, not one of which varies from its appointed place-when we trace the
   power of a creator, from a mite to an elephant, from an atom to an
   universe-can we suppose that the mind that could conceive such a design,
   and the power that executed it with incomparable perfection, cannot write
   without the inconsistence, or that a book so written can be the work of
   such a power?

   The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine, need no commentator to
   explain, compound, derange and rearrange their several parts, to render
   them intelligible; he can relate a fact, or write an essay, without
   forgetting in one page what he has written in another: certainly then, did
   the God of all perfection condescend to write or dictate a book, that book
   would be as perfect as Himself is perfect. The Bible is not so, and it is
   confessedly not so, by the attempts to amend it.

   Perhaps I shall be told that though I have produced one instance I cannot
   produce another of equal force. One is sufficient to call in question the
   genuineness or authenticity of any book that pretends to be the Word of
   God; for such a book would, as before said, be as perfect as its author is
   perfect.

   I will, however, advance only four chapters further into the book of
   Genesis, and produce another example that is sufficient to invalidate the
   story to which it belongs.

   We have all heard of Noah's Flood; and it is impossible to think of the
   whole human race-men, women, children, and infants, except one
   family-deliberately drowning, without "feeling a painful sensation. That
   heart must be a heart of flint that can contemplate such a scene with
   tranquility.

   There is nothing of the ancient mythology, nor in the religion of any
   people we know of upon the globe, that records a sentence of their God, or
   of their gods, so tremendously severe and merciless. If the story be not
   true, we blasphemously dishonor God by believing it, and still more so in
   forcing, by laws and penalties, that belief upon others. I go now to show
   from the face of the story that it carries the evidence of not being true.

   I know not if the judge, the jury, and Mr. Erskine, who tried and
   convicted Williams, ever read the Bible or know anything of its contents,
   and therefore I will state the case precisely.

   There was no such people as Jews or Israelites in the time that Noah is
   said to have lived, and consequently there was no such law as that which
   is called the Jewish or Mosaic law. It is, according to the Bible, more
   than six hundred years from the time the Flood is said to have happened,
   to the time of Moses, and consequently the time the Flood is said to have
   happened was more than six hundred years prior to the law, called the Law
   of Moses, even admitting Moses to have been the giver of that law, of
   which there is great cause to doubt.

   We have here two different epochs, or points of time-that of the Flood,
   and that of the Law of Moses-the former more than six hundred years prior
   to the latter. But the maker of the story of the Flood, whoever he was,
   has betrayed himself by blundering, for he has reversed the order of the
   times. He has told the story, as if the Law of Moses was prior to the
   Flood; for he has made God to say to Noah (Gen. vii. 2), "Of every clean
   beast, thou shalt take unto thee by sevens, male and his female, and of
   beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female."

   This is the Mosaic law, and could only be said after that law was given,
   not before. There was no such thing as beasts clean and unclean in the
   time of Noah. It is nowhere said they were created so. They were only
   declared to be so, as meats, by the Mosaic law, and that to the Jews only,
   and there were no such people as Jews in the time of Noah. This is the
   blundering condition in which this strange story stands.

   When we reflect on a sentence so tremendously severe as that of consigning
   the whole human race, eight persons excepted, to deliberate drowning; a
   sentence, which represents the Creator in a more merciless character than
   any of those whom we call Pagans ever represented the Creator to be, under
   the figure of any of their deities, we ought at least to suspend our
   belief of it, on a comparison of the beneficent character of the Creator
   with the tremendous severity of the sentence; but when we see the story
   told with such an evident contradiction of circumstances, we ought to set
   it down for nothing better than a Jewish fable told by nobody knows whom
   and nobody knows when.

   It is a relief to the genuine and sensible soul of man to find the story
   unfounded. It frees us from two painful sensations at once; that of having
   hard thoughts of the Creator, on account of the severity of the sentence;
   and that of sympathizing in the horrid tragedy of a drowning world. He who
   cannot feel the force of what I mean is not, in my estimation, of
   character worthy the name of a human being.

   I have just said there is great cause to doubt if the law, called the Law
   of Moses, was given by Moses; the books called the books of Moses,  which
   contain among other things what is called the Mosaic law, are put in front
   of the Bible, in the manner of a constitution, with a history annexed to
   it.

   Had these books been written by Moses, they would undoubtedly have been
   the oldest books in the Bible, and entitled to be placed first, and the
   law and the history they contain would be frequently referred to in the
   books that follow; but this is not the case. From the time of Othniel, the
   first of the judges (Judges iii. 9) to the end of the book of Judges,
   which contains a period of four hundred and ten years, this law, and those
   books, were not in practise, nor known among the Jews; nor are they so
   much as alluded to throughout the whole of that period.

   And if the reader will examine 2 Kings xx, xxi. and 2 Chron. xxxiv., he
   will find that no such law, nor any such books, were known in the time of
   the Jewish monarchy, and that the Jews were Pagans during the whole of
   that time, and of their judges.

   The first time the law called the Law of Moses made its appearance was in
   the time of Josiah, about a thousand years after Moses was dead; it is
   then said to have been found by accident. The account of this finding, or
   pretended finding, is given 2 Chron. xxxiv. 14-18: "Hilkiah the priest
   found the book of the Law of the Lord, given by Moses, and Hilkiah
   answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law
   in the house of the Lord, and Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and
   Shaphan carried the book to the king, and Shaphan told the king (Josiah),
   saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book."

   In consequence of this finding-which much resembles that of poor
   Chatterton finding manuscript poems of Rowley the monk in the cathedral
   church at Bristol, or the late finding of manuscripts of Shakespeare in an
   old chest (two well known frauds)-Josiah abolished the Pagan religion of
   the Jews, massacred all the Pagan priests, though he himself had been a
   Pagan, as the reader will see in 2 Kings, xxiii., and thus established in
   blood the law that is there called the Law of Moses, and instituted a
   passover in commemoration thereof.

   The twenty-second verse, speaking of this passover, says, "surely there
   was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged
   Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor the kings of
   Judah"; and ver. 25, in speaking of this priest-killing Josiah, says,
   "Like unto him, there was nothing before him, that turned to the Lord with
   all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to
   all the Law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him."

   This verse, like the former one, is a general declaration against all the
   preceding kings without exception. It is also a declaration against all
   that reigned after him, of which there were four, the whole time of whose
   reigning make but twenty-two years and six months, before the Jews were
   entirely broken up as a nation and their monarchy destroyed.

   It is therefore evident that the law called the Law of Moses, of which the
   Jews talk so much, was promulgated and established only in the latter time
   of the Jewish monarchy; and it is very remarkable, that no sooner had they
   established it than they were a destroyed people, as if they were punished
   of acting an imposition and affixing the name of the Lord to it, and
   massacring their former priests under the pretense of religion.

   The sum of the history of the Jews is this-they continued to be a nation
   about a thousand years, they then established a law, which they called the
   Law of the Lord given by Moses, and were destroyed. This is not opinion,
   but historical evidence.

   Levi the Jew, who has written an answer to "The Age of Reason," gives a
   strange account of the Law of Moses. In speaking of the story of the sun
   and moon standing still, that the Israelites might cut the throats of all
   their enemies, and hang all their kings, as told in Joshua x., he says,
   "There is also another proof of the reality of this miracle, which is, the
   appeal that the author of the book of Joshua makes of the book of Jasher:
   Is not this written in the book of Jasher?

   "Hence," continues Levi, "it is manifest that the book commonly called the
   book of Jasher existed and was well known at the time the book of Joshua
   was written; and pray, Sir," continues Levi, "what book do you think this
   was? Why, no other than the Law of Moses." Levi, like the Bishop of
   Llandaff, and many other guess-work commentators, either forgets, or does
   not know, what there is in one part of the Bible, when he is giving his
   opinion upon another part.

   I did not, however, expect to find so much ignorance in a Jew, with
   respect to the history of his nation, though I might not be surprised at
   it in a bishop. If Levi will look into the account given in 2 Sam. i.
   15-18, of the Amalekite slaying Saul, and bringing the crown and bracelets
   to David, he will find the following recital: "And David called one of the
   young men, and said, go near and fall upon him (the Amalekite) and he
   smote him that he died": "and David lamented with this lamentation over
   Saul and over Jonathan his son; also he bade them teach the children the
   use of the bow;-behold it is written in the book of Jasher."

   If the book of Jasher were what Levi calls it, the Law of Moses, written
   by Moses, it is not possible that anything that David said or did could be
   written in that law, since Moses died more than five hundred years before
   David was born; and, on the other hand, admitting the book of Jasher to be
   the law called the Law of Moses, that law must have been  written more
   than five hundred years after Moses was dead, or it could not relate
   anything said or done by David. Levi may take which of these cases he
   pleases, for both are against him.

   I am not going in the course of this letter to write a commentary on the
   Bible. The two instances I have produced, and which are taken from the
   beginning of the Bible, show the necessity of examining it. It is a book
   that has been read more, and examined less, than any book that ever
   existed.

   Had it come to us as an Arabic or Chinese book, and said to have been a
   sacred book by the people from whom it came, no apology would have been
   made for the confused and disorderly state it is in. The tales it relates
   of the Creator would have been censured, and our pity excited for those
   who believed them. We should have vindicated the goodness of God against
   such a book, and preached up the disbelief of it out of reverence to Him.

   Why then do we not act as honorably by the Creator in the one case as we
   would do in the other? As a Chinese book we would have examined it; ought
   we not then to examine it as a Jewish book ? The Chinese are a people who
   have all the appearance of far greater antiquity than the Jews, and in
   point of permanency there is no comparison. They are also a people of mild
   manners and of good morals, except where they have been corrupted by
   European commerce. Yet we take the word of a restless bloody-minded
   people, as the Jews of Palestine were, when we would reject the same
   authority from a better people.

   We ought to see it is habit and prejudice that have prevented people from
   examining the Bible. Those of the Church of England call it holy, because
   the Jews called it so, and because custom and certain acts of Parliament
   call it so, and they read it from custom. Dissenters read it for the
   purpose of doctrinal controversy, and are very fertile in discoveries and
   inventions.

   But none of them read it for the pure purpose of information, and of
   rendering justice to the Creator, by examining if the evidence it contains
   warrants the belief of its being what it is called.

   Instead of doing this they take it blindfolded, and will have it to be the
   Word of God whether it be so or not.

   For my own part, my belief in the perfection of the Deity will not permit
   me to believe that a book so manifestly obscure, disorderly, and
   contradictory can be His work. I can write a better book myself. This
   belief in me proceeds from my belief in the Creator. I cannot pin my faith
   upon the say so of Hilkiah the priest, who said he found it, or any part
   of it, nor upon Shaphan the scribe, nor upon any priest nor any scribe, or
   man of the law of the present day.

   As to acts of Parliament, there are some that say there are witches and
   wizards; and the persons who made those acts (it was in the time of James
   I), made also some acts which call the Bible the Holy Scriptures, or Word
   of God. But acts of Parliament decide nothing with respect to God; and as
   these acts of Parliament makers were wrong with respect to witches and
   wizards, they may also be wrong with respect to the book in question.

   It is, therefore, necessary that the book be examined; it is our duty to
   examine it; and to suppress the right of examination is sinful in any
   government, or in any judge or jury. The Bible makes God to say to Moses,
   Deut. vii. 2, "And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee,
   thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no
   covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them."

   Not all the priests, nor scribes, nor tribunals in the world, nor all the
   authority of man, shall make me believe that God ever gave such a
   Robespierrian precept as that of showing no mercy; and consequently it is
   impossible that I, or any person who believes as reverentially of the
   Creator as I do, can believe such a book to be the Word of God.

   There have been, and still are, those, who while they profess to believe
   the Bible to be the Word of God, affect to turn it into ridicule. Taking
   their profession and conduct together, they act blasphemously; because
   they act as if God Himself was not to be believed. The case is exceedingly
   different with respect to "The Age of Reason." That book is written  to
   show, from the Bible itself, that there is abundant matter to suspect it
   is not the Word of God, and that we have been imposed upon, first by Jews,
   and afterwards by priests and commentators.

   Not one of those who have attempted to write answers to "The Age of
   Reason," have taken the ground upon which only an answer could be written.
   The case in question is not upon any point of doctrine, but altogether
   upon a matter of fact. Is the book called the Bible the Word of God, or is
   it not ? If it can be proved to be so, it ought to be believed as such; if
   not, it ought not to be believed as such. This is the true state of the
   case. "The Age of Reason" produces evidence to show, and I have in this
   letter produced additional evidence, that it is not the Word of God. Those
   who take the contrary side, should prove that it is. But this they have
   not done, nor attempted to do, and consequently they have done nothing to
   the purpose.

   The prosecutors of Williams have shrunk from the point, as the answerers
   [of "The Age of Reason"] have done. They have availed themselves of
   prejudice instead of proof. If a writing was produced in a court of
   judicature, said to be the writing of a certain person, and upon the
   reality or non-reality of which some matter at issue depended, the point
   to be proved would be, that such writing was the writing of such person.

   Or if the issue depended upon certain words, which some certain person was
   said to have spoken, the point to be proved would be that such words were
   spoken by such person; and Mr. Erskine would contend the case upon this
   ground. A certain book is said to be the Word of God. What is the proof
   that it is so? for upon this the whole depends; and if it cannot be proved
   to be so, the prosecution fails for want of evidence.

   The prosecution against Williams charges him with publishing a book,
   entitled "The Age of Reason," which, it says, is an impious, blasphemous
   pamphlet, tending to ridicule and bring into contempt the Holy Scriptures.
   Nothing is more easy than to find abusive words, and English prosecutions
   are famous for this species of vulgarity.

   The charge however is sophistical; for the charge, as growing out of the
   pamphlet should have stated, not as it now states, to ridicule and bring
   into contempt the Holy Scriptures, but to show that the book called the
   Holy Scriptures are not the Holy Scriptures. It is one thing if I ridicule
   a work as being written by a certain person; but it is quite a different
   thing if I write to prove that such work was not written by such person.

   In the first case, I attack the person through the work; in the other
   case, I defend the honor of the person against the work. That is what "The
   Age of Reason" does, and consequently the charge in the indictment is
   sophistically stated. Every one will admit, that if the Bible be not the
   Word of God we err in believing it to be His word, and ought not to
   believe it. Certainly then, the ground the prosecution should take would
   be to prove that the Bible is in fact what it is called. But this the
   prosecution has not done, and cannot do.

   In all cases the prior fact must be proved before the subsequent facts can
   be admitted in evidence. In a prosecution for adultery, the fact of
   marriage, which is the prior fact, must be proved, before the facts to
   prove adultery can be received. If the fact of marriage cannot be proved,
   adultery cannot be proved; arid if the prosecution cannot prove the Bible
   to be the Word of God, the charge of blasphemy is visionary and
   groundless.

   In Turkey they might prove, if the case happened, that a certain book was
   bought of a certain bookseller, and that the said book was written against
   the Koran. In Spain and Portugal they might prove that a certain book was
   bought of a certain bookseller, and that the said book was written against
   the infallibility of the Pope.

   Under the ancient mythology they might have proved that a certain writing
   was bought of a certain person, and that the said writing was written
   against the belief of a plurality of gods, and in the support of the
   belief of one god: Socrates was condemned for a work of this kind.

   All these are but subsequent facts, and amount to nothing, unless the
   prior facts be proved. The prior fact, with respect to the first case is,
   Is the Koran the Word of God ? With respect to the second, Is the
   infallibility of the Pope a truth? With respect to the third, Is the
   belief of a plurality of gods a true belief? And in like manner with
   respect to the present prosecution, Is the book called the Bible the Word
   of God?

   If the present prosecution prove no more than could be proved in any or
   all of these cases, it proves only as they do, or as an inquisition would
   prove; and in this view of the case, the prosecutors ought at least to
   leave off reviling that infernal institution, the Inquisition.

   The prosecution, however, though it may injure the individual, may promote
   the cause of truth; because the manner in which it has been conducted
   appears a confession to the world that there is no evidence to prove that
   the Bible is the Word of God. On what authority then do we believe the
   many strange stories that the Bible tells of God?

   This prosecution has been carried on through the medium of what is called
   a special jury, and the whole of a special jury is nominated by the master
   of the Crown-office. Mr. Erskine vaunts himself upon the bill he brought
   into Parliament with respect to trials for what the government party calls
   libels. But if in Crown prosecutions the master of the Crown-office is to
   continue to appoint the whole special jury, which he does by nominating
   the forty-eight persons from which the solicitor of each party is to
   strike out twelve, Mr. Erskine's bill is only vapor and smoke. The root of
   the grievance lies in the manner of forming the jury, and to this Mr.
   Erskine's bill applies no remedy.

   When the trial of Williams came on, only eleven of the special jurymen
   appeared, and the trial was adjourned. In cases where the whole number do
   not appear, it is customary to make up the deficiency by taking jurymen
   from persons present in court. This in the law term is called a tales. Why
   was not this done in this case? Reason will suggest that they did not
   choose to depend on a man accidentally taken.

   When the trial recommenced the whole of the special jury appeared, and
   Williams was convicted: It is folly to contend a cause where the whole
   jury is nominated by one of the parties. I will relate a recent case that
   explains a great deal with respect to special juries in Crown
   prosecutions.

   On the trial of Lambert and others, printers and proprietors of the
   Morning Chronicle, lot a libel, a special jury was struck, on the prayer
   of the attorney-general, who used to be called Diabolus Regis, or King's
   Devil. Only seven or eight of the special jury appeared, and the
   attorney-general not praying a tales, the trial stood over to a future
   day; when it was to be brought on a second time the attorney-general
   prayed for a new special jury, but as this was not admissible the original
   special jury was summoned.

   Only eight of them appeared, on which the attorney-general said, "As I
   cannot, on a second trial, have a special jury, I will pray a tales." Four
   persons were then taken from the persons present in court and added to the
   eight special jurymen. The jury went out at two o'clock to consult on
   their verdict, and the judge (Kenyon) understanding they were divided, and
   likely to be some time in making up their minds, retired from the bench
   and went home.

   At seven, the jury went, attended by an officer of the court, to the
   judge's house, and delivered a verdict, "Guilty of publishing, but with no
   malicious intention." The judge said, "I cannot record this verdict: it is
   no verdict at all." The jury withdrew, and after sitting in consultation
   till five in the morning, brought in a verdict "not guilty." Would this
   have been the case, had they been all special jurymen nominated by the
   master of the Crown-office? This is one of the cases that ought to open
   the eyes of people with respect to the manner of forming special juries.

   On the trial of Williams, the judge prevented the counsel for the
   defendant proceeding in the defense. The prosecution had selected a number
   of passages from "The Age of Reason" and inserted them in the indictment.
   The defending counsel was selecting other passages to show that the
   passages in the indictment were conclusions drawn from premises and
   unfairly separated therefrom in the indictment.

   The judge said, he did not know how to act; meaning thereby whether to let
   the counsel proceed in the defense or not; and asked the jury if they
   wished to hear the passages read which the defending counsel had selected.
   The jury said NO, and the defending counsel was in consequence silenced.

   Mr. Erskine then (Falstaff-like), having all the field to himself, and no
   enemy at hand, laid about him most heroicly, and the jury found the
   defendant guilty. I know not if Mr. Erskine ran out of court and halooed,
   "Huzza for the Bible and the trial by jury."

   Robespierre caused a decree to be passed during the trial of Brissot and
   others that after a trial had lasted three days (the whole of which time,
   in the case of Brissot, was taken up by the prosecuting party) the judge
   should ask the jury (who were then a packed jury) if they were satisfied?
   If the jury said YES, the trial ended and the jury proceeded to give their
   verdict without hearing the defense of the accused party. It needs no
   depth of wisdom to make an application of this case.

   I will now state a case to show that the trial of Williams is not a trial
   according to Kenyon's own explanation of law.

   On a late trial in London (Selthens versus Hoossman) on a policy of
   insurance, one of the jurymen, Mr. Dunnage, after hearing one side of the
   case, and without hearing the other side, got up and said, "it was as
   legal a policy of insurance as ever was written." The judge, who was the
   same as presided on the trial of Williams, replied "that it was a great
   misfortune when any gentleman of the jury makes up his mind on a cause
   before it was finished."

   Mr. Erskine, who in that cause was counsel for the defendant (in this he
   was against the defendant) cried out, "it is worse than a misfortune, it
   is a fault." The judge, in his address to the jury in summing up the
   evidence, expatiated upon, and explained the parts which the law assigned
   to the counsel on each side, to the witnesses, and to the judge, and said,
   "When all this was done, AND NOT UNTIL THEN, it was the business of the
   jury to declare what the justice of the case was; and that it was
   extremely rash and imprudent in any man to draw a conclusion before all
   the premises were laid before them upon which that conclusion was to be
   grounded."

   According then to Kenyon's own doctrine, the trial of Williams is an
   irregular trial, the verdict an irregular verdict, and as such is not
   recordable.

   As to the special juries, they are but modern; and were instituted for the
   purpose of determining cases at law between merchants; because as the
   method of keeping merchants' accounts differs from that of common
   tradesmen, and their business, by lying much in foreign bills of exchange,
   insurance, etc., is of a different description to that of common
   tradesmen, it might happen that a common jury might not be competent to
   form a judgment.

   The law that instituted special juries, makes it necessary that the jurors
   be merchants, or of the degree of squires. A special jury in London is
   generally composed of merchants; and in the country, of men called country
   squires, that is, fox-hunters, or men qualified to hunt foxes. The one may
   decide very well upon a case of pounds, shillings and pence, or of the
   counting-house: and the other of the jockey-club or the chase. But who
   would not laugh, that because such men can decide such cases they can also
   be jurors upon theology.

   Talk with some London merchants about Scripture, and they will understand
   you mean scrip, and tell you how much it is worth at the Stock Exchange.
   Ask them about theology and they will say they know of no such gentleman
   upon 'Change. Tell some country squires of the sun and moon standing
   still, the one on the top of a hill, the other in a valley, and they will
   swear it is a lie of one's own making.

   Tell them that God Almighty ordered a man to make a cake and bake it with
   a t-d and eat it, and they will say it is one of Dean Swift's blackguard
   stories. Tell them it is in the Bible and they will lay a bowl of punch it
   is not, and leave it to the parson of the parish to decide. Ask them also
   about theology and they will say they know of no such a one on the turf.

   An appeal to such juries serves to bring the Bible into more ridicule than
   anything the author of "The Age of Reason" has written; and the manner in
   which the trial has been conducted shows that the prosecutor dares not
   come to the point, nor meet the defense of the defendant. But all other
   cases apart, on what grounds of right, otherwise than on the right assumed
   by an inquisition, do such prosecutions stand?

   Religion is a private affair between every man and his Maker, and no
   tribunal or third party has a right to interfere between them. It is not
   properly a thing of this world; it is only practised in this world; but
   its object is in a future world; and it is not otherwise an object of just
   laws than for the purpose of protecting the equal rights of all, however
   various their belief may be.

   If one man choose to believe the book called the Bible to be the Word of
   God, and another, from the convinced idea of the purity and perfection of
   God compared with the contradictions the book contains-from the
   lasciviousness of some of its stories, like that of Lot getting drunk and
   debauching his two daughters, which is not spoken of as a crime, and for
   which the most absurd apologies are made-from the immorality of some of
   its precepts, like that of showing no mercy-and from the total want of
   evidence on the case-thinks he ought not to believe it to be the Word of
   God, each of them has an equal right; and if the one has a right to give
   his reasons for believing it to be so, the other has an equal right to
   give his reasons for believing the contrary.

   Anything that goes beyond this rule is an inquisition. Mr. Erskine talks
   of his moral education: Mr. Erskine is very little acquainted with
   theological subjects, if he does not know there is such a thing as a
   sincere and religious belief that the Bible is not the Word of God. This
   is my belief; it is the belief of thousands far more learned than Mr.
   Erskine; and it is a belief that is every day increasing. It is not
   infidelity, as Mr. Erskine profanely and abusively calls it; it is the
   direct reverse of infidelity. It is a pure religious belief, founded on
   the idea of the perfection of the Creator.

   If the Bible be the Word of God it needs not the wretched aid of
   prosecutions to support it, and you might with as much propriety make a
   law to protect the sunshine as to protect the Bible. Is the Bible like the
   sun, or the work of God ? We see that God takes good care of the creation
   He has made. He suffers no part of it to be extinguished: and He will take
   the same care of His word, if he ever gave one.

   But men ought to be reverentially careful and suspicious how they ascribe
   books to Him as His word, which from this confused condition would
   dishonor a common scribbler, and against which there is abundant evidence,
   and every cause to suspect imposition. Leave the Bible to itself. God will
   take care of it if He has anything to do with it, as He takes care of the
   sun and the moon, which need not your laws for their better protection.

   As the two instances I have produced in the beginning of this letter, from
   the book of Genesis-the one respecting the account called the Mosaic
   account of the creation, the other of the flood-sufficiently show the
   necessity of examining the Bible, in order to ascertain what degree of
   evidence there is for receiving or rejecting it as a sacred book, I shall
   not add more upon that subject; but in order to show Mr. Erskine that
   there are religious establishments for public worship which make no
   profession of faith of the books called Holy Scriptures, nor admit of
   priests, I will conclude with an account of a society lately begun in
   Paris, and which is very rapidly extending itself.

   The society takes the name of Theophilantropts, which would be rendered in
   English by the word Theophilanthropists, a word com- pounded of three
   Greek words, signifying God, Love, and Man. The explanation given to this
   word is lovers of God and man, or adorers of God and friends of man,
   adorateurs de Dieu et amis des hommes. The society proposes to publish
   each year a volume, entitled Annee Religieuse des Theophilantropes, Year
   Religious of the Theophilanthropists.

   The first volume is just published, entitled:

   RELIGIOUS YEAR OF THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS:

   OR

   ADORERS OF GOD AND FRIENDS OF MAN

   Being a collection of the discourses, lectures, hymns and canticles, for
   all the religious and moral festivals of the Theophilanthropists during
   the course of the year, whether in their public temples or in their
   private families, published by the author of the "Manual of the
   Theophilanthropists."

   The volume of this year, which is the first, contains two hundred and
   fourteen pages of duodecimo. The following is the table of contents:

   1. Precise history of the Theophilanthropists.

   2. Exercises common to all the festivals.

   INTRODUCTION

   ENTITLED

   PRECISE HISTORY OF THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS

   "Toward the month of Vendemiaire, of the year 5 (September, 1796), there
   appeared at Paris, a small work entitled "Manual of the
   Theoantropophiles," since called, for the sake of easier pronunciation,
   Theophilantropes (Theophilanthropists), published by C.

   "The worship set forth in this manual, of which the origin is from the
   beginning of the world, was then professed by some families in the silence
   of domestic life. But no sooner was the manual published than some
   persons, respectable for their knowledge and their manners, saw in the
   formation of a society open to the public an easy method of spreading
   moral religion and of leading by degrees great numbers to the knowledge
   thereof, who appear to have forgotten it. This consideration ought of
   itself not to leave indifferent those persons who know that morality and
   religion, which is the most solid support thereof, are necessary to the
   maintenance of society, as well as to the happiness of the individual.
   These considerations determined the families of the Theophilanthropists to
   unite publicly for the exercise of their worship.

   "The first society of this kind opened in the month of Nivose, year 5
   (January, 1797), in the Street Denis, No. 34, corner of Lombard Street.
   The care of conducting this society was undertaken by five fathers of
   families. They adopted the manual of the Theophilanthropists.

   "They agreed to hold their days of public worship on the days
   corresponding to Sundays, but without making this a hindrance to other
   societies to choose such other day as they thought more convenient. Soon
   after this, more societies were opened, of which some celebrate on the
   decadi (tenth day), and others on the Sunday.

   "It was also resolved that the committee should meet one hour each week
   for the purpose of preparing or examining the discourses and lectures
   proposed for the next general assembly; that the general assemblies should
   be called fetes (festivals) religious and moral; that those festivals
   should be conducted in principle and form, in a manner as not to be
   considered as the festivals of an exclusive worship; and that in recalling
   those who might not be attached to any particular worship, those festivals
   might also be attended as moral exercises by disciples of every sect, and
   consequently avoid, by scrupulous care, everything that might make the
   society appear under the name of a sect.

   "The Society adopts neither rites nor priesthood, and it will never lose
   sight of the resolution not to advance anything, as a society,
   inconvenient to any sect or sects, in any time or country, and under any
   government.

   "It will be seen, that it is so much the more easy for the Society to keep
   within this circle, because that the dogmas of the Theophilanthropists are
   those upon which all the sects have agreed, that their moral is that upon
   which there has never been the least dissent; and that the name they have
   taken expresses the double end of all the sects, that of leading to the
   adoration of God and love of man.

   "The Theophilanthropists do not call themselves the disciples of such or
   such a man. They avail themselves of the wise precepts that have been
   transmitted by writers of all countries and in all ages.

   "The reader will find in the discourses, lectures, hymns and canticles,
   which the Theophilanthropists have adopted for their religious and moral
   festivals, and which they present under the title of Annee Religieuse,
   extracts from moralists, ancient and modern, divested of maxims too severe
   or too loosely conceived, or contrary to piety, whether toward God or
   toward man."

   Next follow the dogmas of the Theophilanthropists, or things they profess
   to believe. These are but two, and are thus expressed, les
   Theophilantropes croient a Vexistence de Dieu, et a Vimmortalite de l'ame:
   the Theophilanthropists believe in the existence of God, and the
   immortality of the soul.

   The manual of the Theophilanthropists, a small volume of sixty pages,
   duodecimo, is published separately, as is also their catechism, which is
   of the same size. The principles of the Theophilanthropists are the same
   as those published in the first part of "The Age of Reason" in 1793, and
   in the second part, in 1795. The Theophilanthropists, as a society, are
   silent upon all the things they do not profess to believe, as the
   sacredness of the books called the Bible, etc.

   They profess the immortality of the soul, but they are silent on the
   immortality of the body, or that which the Church of England calls the
   resurrection. The author of "The Age of Reason" gives reasons for
   everything he disbelieves, as well as those he believes; and where this
   cannot be done with safety, the government is a despotism and the Church
   an inquisition.

   It is more than three years since the first part of "The Age of Reason"
   was published, and more than a year and a half since the publication of
   the second part: the Bishop of Llandaff undertook to write an answer to
   the second part; and it was not until after it was known that the author
   of "The Age of Reason" would reply to the Bishop, that the prosecution
   against the book was set on foot; and which is said to be carried on by
   some clergy of the English Church.

   If the Bishop is one of them, and the object be to prevent an exposure of
   the numerous and gross errors he has committed in his work (and which he
   wrote when report said that Thomas Paine was dead), it is a confession
   that he feels the weakness of his cause, and finds himself unable to
   maintain it. In this case he has given me a triumph I did not seek, and
   Mr. Erskine, the herald of the prosecution, has proclaimed it.

   THOMAS PAINE.
