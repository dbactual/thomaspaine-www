   To William Short June 28, 1790

   LONDON,

   DEAR SIR:

   The talk and opinion of War is considerably renewed here since my last of
   last Friday p. m. de la Lucerne's dispatches. Another Messenger arrived
   here from Madrid on Friday or Saturday last, but as nothing transpires it
   may be concluded that he did not bring very welcome tidings. The English
   fleet, from every appearance, have received sailing orders and it is
   expected it will sail this day. Its utmost force is 22 Ships of the line.
   They still talk of the Dutch fleet of 12 Ships, but it does not positively
   appear that any have yet joined. No direct opinion is formed of the
   destination of the English fleet. It may probably only be a short Cruise
   by way of seasoning the Men as a great part a[re] landsmen. It is said
   they have 12 Regiments on Board, but this I give as report. My chief
   apprehension is that it is to look out for some detachment of the Spanish
   fleet for this is the English mode of carrying on Naval War, and the
   Policy by which they succeed and therefore ought to be the most
   principally guarded against, and where ever you go into Company,
   especially where it may be of use I wish you would impress this strongly
   and be assured that if they can meet with an advantageous opportunity they
   will not stand upon ceremonies.

   We have accounts of a Naval action between the Russian and Swedish Fleets
   in the Baltic. Such accounts have certainly arrived but not
   authoritatively. The probability however is strongly in favor of the
   report which is that the action commenced on the 2d Inst. and was renewed
   on the 4th at which time the Russian fleet was reinforced by the fleet
   from Revel and that the Swedish Fleet was so disabled that few of them
   were expected to get back to Carlsecrone. The English Funds fell one per
   ct. upon this news yesterday.

   General Washington has been very ill and Dr. Jones has been to attend him.
   Later reports are that he is better.

   I have seen Philadelphia Papers to the 18th of May-every thing going
   through the courtesy of the Library of Congress.-Editor. on well. Exchange
   at Philadelphia 14 & 15 p. Cent Sterling against London. In the United
   States Gazette, about the middle of May is a Bill said to be intended to
   be brought into Congress to prohibit all goods, wares, merchandise coming
   from Rhode Island by Land or by Water entering any part of the United
   States or any vessel putting into any port except in distress.

   Although there are not yet more than 22 Ships of the line, more are put
   into Commission and getting ready for Sea. Admiral Barrington has the
   command at present, but Howe (alias Lord Howe) will probably have the
   command finally.

   There are those here who are inclined to believe that the intended
   destination is the Baltic but I think the probabilities are against it. If
   the British Ministry intended the Baltic it was the worst of all policy to
   alarm by a haughty and threatening message the powers to the southward,
   whose preparations in consequence of that, would prevent her operation to
   the Northward. The only policy, if it can be so called, to account for
   this absurdity upon, is to suppose that Mr. Pitt, elevating himself upon
   the humbling of France in 1787, imagined he might play the same game over
   again and go afterwards to the Baltic. He is in my opinion a wretched hand
   in the affairs of foreign Politics. His forte is that of a Party Man and
   his success even in this he owes more to the disgust the nation took at
   the Coalition than to any thing in himself.

   Yours very affectionatly

   THOMAS PAINE.
