   To Thomas Jefferson  June 18, 1789

   LONDON,

   DEAR SIR:

   I wrote you last night by Mr. Parker. I this morning received the
   following from Sir Joseph Banks:

   "Sir Jos. Banks sends his compts. to Mr. Paine and has the honor for his
   and Mr. Jefferson's information to enclose the particulars of Mr.
   Ledyard's death which have been received by the Association for
   investigating the interior of Africa."

   "June 18th, 1789.

   "Mr. Beausay presents his complts to Sir Joseph Banks, and is much
   concerned that he cannot manage the hope which Mr. Jefferson entertains
   that there is not truth in the report of Mr. Ledyard's death. The letter
   which Mr. Beausay received from Mr. Baldwin, the British Consulat Cairo,
   and which is dated Alexandria, March 4th, 1789 informs him that a day was
   fixed for Mr. Ledyard's departure as he was prepared and seemed anxious to
   set off. But bad weather or other causes occasioned delay as happens to
   most caravans. Mr. Ledyard took offence at the delay and threw himself
   into a violent rage with his conductors which deranged something in his
   system that he thought to curb by an emetic, but he took the dose so
   strong as at the first or second effect of its operations to break a blood
   vessel. In three days he was suffocated and died.

   "This account is confirmed by a letter from the Compte de Rosetta, the
   Venetian Resident at Cairo, to Mr. Hunter, an English merchant who had
   lived in great intimacy with Mr. Ledyard from the time of their travelling
   together from Alexandria to Cairo to that of Mr. Hunter's departure for
   England. This letter is dated Cairo 27th January, 1789 and tells Mr.
   Hunter 'that seventeen days ago poor Mr. Ledyard went to his eternal rest.
   He suffered himself to be transported to anger against the persons who had
   engaged to conduct him to [illegible] because they delayed setting out on
   their voyage for want (as they said) of a fair wind. He was seized with a
   pain in his stomach occasioned by bile and understood to cure himself.
   Excessive vomiting ensued, in consequence of which he broke a blood vessel
   and died in six days.'

   "From the general correspondence of those two accounts Mr. Beausay
   apprehends that no doubt can be entertained of the melancholy fact which
   they announce.

   Great George Street

   June 16th, 1789"

   Thus far Sir Joseph's and Mr. Beausay's letters. They were sent to me in
   answer to an extract from your letter which I gave to Sir Joseph. Ledyard
   was a great favorite with the Society. They consider him as falling a
   sacrifice to integrity and lament him with an affectionate sorrow,
   [illegible] They at first considered him a bold but deliberate adventurer.
   That man, said Sir Joseph one day to me, "was all mind."

   I wish I could have sent you a better account, but I fulfill your request
   by sending such as it is.

   Your affectionate friend and obliged and humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
