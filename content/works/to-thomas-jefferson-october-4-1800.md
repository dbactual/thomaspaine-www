   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Dear Sir

   I understand there is an Article in the Treaty to the following
   purport, that the duties payable upon Articles brought from America into
   france shall not go to the revenue, but shall be appropriated as a fund to
   pay such of the condemned Cargoes as shall be proved to be American property.
   If you should be in the chair, but not otherwise, I offer myself as one
   upon this business, if there should be any occasion to appoint any. It
   will serve to defray my expences until I can return, but I wish it may be
   with the condition of returning. I am not tired of working for nothing but
   I cannot afford it. This appointment will aid me in promoting the object I
   am now upon that of a law of nations for the protection of neutral
   Commerce.

   Salut et respect

   THOMAS PAINE.

  Paris Oct 4 1800
