   To Thomas Jefferson September 7, 1788

   PARIS, FRANCE,

   DEAR SIR:

   I enclose you a problem not about bridges but trees, and to explain my
   meaning I begin with a fountain. The idea seems far-fetched, but fountains
   and trees are in my walk to Challeot.

   Suppose Fig. 1 is a fountain. It is evident that no more water can pass
   through the branching tubes than pass through the trunk that admitting all
   the water to pass with equal freedom the sum of the squares of the
   diameters of the two first branches must be equal to the Square of the
   diameter of the trunk; also the sum of the squares of the four branches,
   must be equal to the two, and the sum of the squares of the 8 branches
   must be equal to the four, and therefore the 8, 4, 2, and the trunk being
   reciprocally equal the solid content of the whole will be equal to the
   cylinder Fig. 2 of the same diameter of the trunk and height of the
   fountain.

   Carry the idea of a fountain to a tree growing; consider the sap ascending
   in capillary tubes like the water in the fountain, and no more sap will
   pass through the branches than pass through the trunk.

   2dly consider the branches as so many divisions and sub-divisions of the
   trunk as they are in the fountain, and that their contents are to be found
   by some rule with the difference only of a Pynmidien figure instead of
   cylindrical one.

   Therefore to find the quantity of timber (or rather loads) in the tree,
   figure 3d. Draw a pyramid equal to the height of the tree as Fig. 4th,
   taking for the inclination of the pyramid, the diameter at the bottom, and
   at any discretionary height above it which in this is as 3 & 2.

   As sensible men should never guess, and as it is impossible to judge
   without some point to begin at, this appears to me to be that point, and
   by which a person may ascertain near enough the quantity of timber and
   loads of wood in any quantity of land, and he may distinguish them into
   timber, wood and faggots.

   Yours, etc.

   T.P.
