   Philip Foner's Introduction:

   In this work, his last great pamphlet, published in the winter of
   1795-1796, Paine continued the discussion he began in Part II of the
   Rights of Man of the problem of the elimination of poverty and developed
   further his proposals for limiting the accumulation of property. The crux
   of the entire question of eliminating poverty, he points out, lay in the
   institution of private property, for this principle was the source of the
   evils of society.

   Landed property and private property, he argued, were made possible only
   by the operation of society since whatever property men accumulated beyond
   their own labor came from the fact that they lived in society. ". . . The
   accumulation of personal property," he wrote, "is, in many instances, the
   effect of paying too little for the labor that produced it; the
   consequence of which is, that the working hand perishes in old age, and
   the employer abounds in affluence." God had never opened a land office, he
   held, from which perpetual deeds to the earth should be issued. He spoke,
   he boldly declared, for "all those who have been thrown out of their
   natural inheritance by the introduction of the system of landed property."
   It is of some interest to note that Thomas Jefferson observed, in a letter
   to Rev. James Madison in February, 1787: "Whenever there are in a country
   uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of
   property have been so far extended as to violate the natural right. The
   earth is given as a common stock for man to labor and live on. If for the
   encouragement of industry we allow it to be appropriated, we must take
   care that other employment be provided for those excluded from the
   appropriation. If we do not, the fundamental right to labor the earth
   returns to the unemployed. . . ." Philip S. Foner, ed., Thomas Jefferson:
   Selections from His Writings, pp. 56-57.
   Since the operation of society had made possible the existence of private
   property, it followed that society was entitled to receive the surplus
   that men accumulated beyond their own labor back from them. Paine proposed
   a plan to deal with the problem of poverty by providing for the taxation
   of accumulated property to permit the state to give each man and woman
   reaching the age of twenty-one the sum of fifteen pounds, and every person
   fifty years of age or over ten pounds per year. His plan, which today
   would be called a system of social insurance, called for graduated
   inheritance taxes and ground rents.
   Unlike many land reformers who preceded and followed him, Paine did not
   advocate the establishment of an agrarian society. For evidence that
   Paine's proposal was too moderate for some contemporary Agrarians, see
   Thomas Spence's pamphlet published in 1797, The Rights of Infants, with
   Scriptures on Paine's Agrarian Justice.

   AUTHOR'S INSCRIPTION

   To the Legislature and the Executive Directory of the French Republic
   The plan contained in this work is not adapted for any particular country
   alone: the principle on which it is based is general. But as the rights of
   man are a new study in this world, and one needing protection from
   priestly imposture, and the insolence of oppressions too long established,
   I have thought it right to place this little work under your safeguard.

   When we reflect on the long and dense night in which France and all Europe
   have remained plunged by their governments and their priests, we must feel
   less surprise than grief at the bewilderment caused by the first burst of
   light that dispels the darkness. The eye accustomed to darkness can hardly
   bear at first the broad daylight. It is by usage the eye learns to see,
   and it is the same in passing from any situation to its opposite.

   As we have not at one instant renounced all our errors, we cannot at one
   stroke acquire knowledge of all our rights. France has had the honor of
   adding to the word Liberty that of Equality; and this word signifies
   essentially a principle that admits of no gradation in the things to which
   it applies. But equality is often misunderstood, often misapplied, and
   often violated.
   Liberty and Property are words expressing all those of our possessions
   which are not of an intellectual nature. There are two kinds of property.
   Firstly, natural property, or that which comes to us from the Creator of
   the universe-such as the earth, air, water. Secondly, artificial or
   acquired property-the invention of men.

   In the latter, equality is impossible; for to distribute it equally it
   would be necessary that all should have contributed in the same
   proportion, which can never be the case; and this being the case, every
   individual would hold on to his own property, as his right share. Equality
   of natural property is the subject of this little essay. Every individual
   in the world is born therein with legitimate claims on a certain kind of
   property, or its equivalent.

   The right of voting for persons charged with the execution of the laws
   that govern society is inherent in the word liberty, and constitutes the
   equality of personal rights. But even if that right (of voting) were
   inherent in property, which I deny, the right of suffrage would still
   belong to all equally, because, as I have said, all individuals have
   legitimate birthrights in a certain species of property.

   I have always considered the present Constitution of the French Republic1
   the best organized system the human mind has yet produced. But I hope my
   former colleagues will not be offended if I warn them of an error which
   has slipped into its principle. Equality of the right of suffrage is not
   maintained. This right is in it connected with a condition on which it
   ought not to depend; that is, with a proportion of a certain tax called
   "direct."

   The dignity of suffrage is thus lowered; and, in placing it in the scale
   with an inferior thing, the enthusiasm that right is capable of inspiring
   is diminished. It is impossible to find any equivalent counterpoise for
   the right of suffrage, because it is alone worthy to be its own basis, and
   cannot thrive as a graft, or an appendage.

   Since the Constitution was established we have seen two conspiracies
   stranded-that of Babeuf2, and that of some obscure personages who decorate
   themselves with the despicable name of "royalists." The defect in
   principle of the Constitution was the origin of Babeuf's conspiracy.

   He availed himself of the resentment caused by this flaw, and instead of
   seeking a remedy by legitimate and constitutional means, or proposing some
   measure useful to society, the conspirators did their best to renew
   disorder and confusion, and constituted themselves personally into a
   Directory, which is formally destructive of election and representation.
   They were, in fine, extravagant enough to suppose that society, occupied
   with its domestic affairs, would blindly yield to them a directorship
   usurped by violence.

   The conspiracy of Babeuf was followed in a few months by that of the
   royalists, who foolishly flattered themselves with the notion of doing
   great things by feeble or foul means. They counted on all the
   discontented, from whatever cause, and tried to rouse, in their turn, the
   class of people who had been following the others. But these new chiefs
   acted as if they thought society had nothing more at heart than to
   maintain courtiers, pensioners, and all their train, under the
   contemptible title of royalty. My little essay will disabuse them, by
   showing that society is aiming at a very different end-maintaining itself.

   We all know or should know, that the time during which a revolution is
   proceeding is not the time when its resulting advantages can be enjoyed.
   But had Babeuf and his accomplices taken into consideration the condition
   of France under this Constitution, and compared it with what it was under
   the tragical revolutionary government, and during the execrable Reign of
   Terror, the rapidity of the alteration must have appeared to them very
   striking and astonishing. Famine has been replaced by abundance, and by
   the well-founded hope of a near and increasing prosperity.

   As for the defect in the Constitution, I am fully convinced that it will
   be rectified constitutionally, and that this step is indispensable; for so
   long as it continues it will inspire the hopes and furnish the means of
   conspirators; and for the rest, it is regrettable that a Constitution so
   wisely organized should err so much in its principle. This fault exposes
   it to other dangers which will make themselves felt.

   Intriguing candidates will go about among those who have not the means to
   pay the direct tax and pay it for them, on condition of receiving their
   votes. Let us maintain inviolably equality in the sacred right of
   suffrage: public security can never have a basis more solid. Salut et
   Fraternite.

   Your former colleague,

   THOMAS PAINE.


   AUTHOR'S ENGLISH PREFACE

   THE following little piece was written in the winter of 1795 and '96; and,
   as I had not determined whether to publish it during the present war, or
   to wait till the commencement of a peace, it has lain by me, without
   alteration or addition, from the time it was written.
   What has determined me to publish it now is a sermon preached by Watson,
   Bishop of LlandafL Some of my readers will recollect, that this Bishop
   wrote a book entitled "An Apology for the Bible," in answer to my second
   part of "The Age of Reason." I procured a copy of his book, and he may
   depend upon hearing from me on that subject.
   At the end of the Bishop's book is a list of the works he has written.
   Among which is the sermon alluded to; it is entitled: "The Wisdom and
   Goodness of God, in having made both Rich and Poor; with an Appendix,
   containing Reflections on the Present State of England and France."
   The error contained in this sermon determined me to publish my "Agrarian
   Justice." It is wrong to say God made rich and poor; He made only male and
   female; and He gave them the earth for their inheritance. . .
   Instead of preaching to encourage one part of mankind in insolence. . . it
   would be better that priests employed their time to render the general
   condition of man less miserable than it is. Practical religion consists in
   doing good: and the only way of serving God is that of endeavoring to make
   His creation happy. All preaching that has not this for its object is
   nonsense and hypocrisy.

   THOMAS PAINE.


   AGRARIAN JUSTICE

   To preserve the benefits of what is called civilized life, and to remedy
   at the same time the evil which it has produced, ought to considered as
   one of the first objects of reformed legislation.
   Whether that state that is proudly, perhaps erroneously, called
   civilization, has most promoted or most injured the general happiness of
   man is a question that may be strongly contested. On one side, the
   spectator is dazzled by splendid appearances; on the other, he is shocked
   by extremes of wretchedness; both of which it has erected. The most
   affluent and the most miserable of the human race are to be found in the
   countries that are called civilized.
   To understand what the state of society ought to be, it is necessary to
   have some idea of the natural and primitive state of man; such as it is at
   this day among the Indians of North America. There is not, in that state,
   any of those spectacles of human misery which poverty and want present to
   our eyes in all the towns and streets in Europe.
   Poverty, therefore, is a thing created by that which is called civilized
   life. It exists not in the natural state. On the other hand, the natural
   state is without those advantages which flow from agriculture, arts,
   science and manufactures.
   The life of an Indian is a continual holiday, compared with the poor of
   Europe; and, on the other hand it appears to be abject when compared to
   the rich. Civilization, therefore, or that which is so-called, has
   operated two ways: to make one part of society more affluent, and the
   other more wretched, than would have been the lot of either in a natural
   state.
   It is always possible to go from the natural to the civilized state, but
   it is never possible to go from the civilized to the natural state. The
   reason is that man in a natural state, subsisting by hunting, requires ten
   times the quantity of land to range over to procure himself sustenance,
   than would support him in a civilized state, where the earth is
   cultivated.
   When, therefore, a country becomes populous by the additional aids of
   cultivation, art and science, there is a necessity of preserving things in
   that state; because without it there cannot be sustenance for more,
   perhaps, than a tenth part of its inhabitants. The thing, therefore, now
   to be done is to remedy the evils and preserve the benefits that have
   arisen to society by passing from the natural to that which is called the
   civilized state.
   In taking the matter upon this ground, the first principle of civilization
   ought to have been, and ought still to be, that the condition of every
   person born into the world, after a state of civilization commences, ought
   not to be worse than if he had been born before that period.
   But the fact is that the condition of millions, in every country in
   Europe, is far worse than if they had been born before civilization begin,
   had been born among the Indians of North America at the present. I will
   show how this fact has happened.
   It is a position not to be controverted that the earth, in its natural,
   cultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the common
   property of the human race.  In that state every man would have been born
   to property. He would have been a joint life proprietor with rest in the
   property of the soil, and in all its natural productions, vegetable and
   animal.
   But the earth in its natural state, as before said, is capable of
   supporting but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it is
   capable of doing in a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to
   separate the improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon
   which that improvement is made, the idea of landed property arose from
   that parable connection; but it is nevertheless true, that it is the value
   of the improvement, only, and not the earth itself, that is individual
   property.
   Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated lands, owes to the community
   ground-rent (for I know of no better term to express the idea) for the
   land which he holds; and it is from this ground-rent that the fund prod in
   this plan is to issue.
   It is deducible, as well from the nature of the thing as from all the
   stories transmitted to us, that the idea of landed property commenced with
   cultivation, and that there was no such thing, as landed property before
   that time. It could not exist in the first state of man, that of hunters.
   It did not exist in the second state, that of shepherds: neither Abraham,
   Isaac, Jacob, nor Job, so far as the history of the Bible may credited in
   probable things, were owners of land.
   Their property consisted, as is always enumerated in flocks and herds,
   they traveled with them from place to place. The frequent contentions at
   that time about the use of a well in the dry country of Arabia, where
   those people lived, also show that there was no landed property. It was
   not admitted that land could be claimed as property.
   There could be no such thing as landed property originally. Man did not
   make the earth, and, though he had a natural right to occupy it, he had no
   right to locate as his property in perpetuity any part of it; neither did
   the Creator of the earth open a land-office, from whence the first
   title-deeds should issue. Whence then, arose the idea of landed property?
   I answer as before, that when cultivation began the idea of landed
   property began with it, from the impossibility of separating the
   improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which that
   improvement was made.

   The value of the improvement so far exceeded the value of the natural
   earth, at that time, as to absorb it; till, in the end, the common right
   of all became confounded into the cultivated right of the individual. But
   there are, nevertheless, distinct species of rights, and will continue to
   be, so long as the earth endures.

   It is only by tracing things to their origin that we can gain rightful
   ideas of them, and it is by gaining such ideas that we, discover the
   boundary that divides right from wrong, and teaches every man to know his
   own. I have entitled this tract "Agrarian Justice" to distinguish it from
   "Agrarian Law."

   Nothing could be more unjust than agrarian law in a country improved by
   cultivation; for though every man, as an inhabitant of the earth, is a
   joint proprietor of it in its natural state, it does not follow that he is
   a joint proprietor of cultivated earth. The additional value made by
   cultivation, after the system was admitted, became the property of those
   who did it, or who inherited it from them, or who purchased it. It had
   originally no owner. While, therefore, I advocate the right, and interest
   myself in the hard case of all those who have been thrown out of their
   natural inheritance by the introduction of the system of landed property,
   I equally defend the right of the possessor to the part which is his.

   Cultivation is at least one of the greatest natural improvements ever made
   by human invention. It has given to created earth a tenfold value. But the
   landed monopoly that began with it has produced the greatest evil. It has
   dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of every nation of their
   natural inheritance, without providing for them, as ought to have been
   done, an indemnification for that loss, and has thereby created a species
   of poverty and wretchedness that did not exist before.

   In advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right,
   and not a charity, that I am pleading for. But it is that kind of right
   which, being neglected at first, could not be brought forward afterwards
   till heaven had opened the way by a revolution in the system of
   government. Let us then do honor to revolutions by justice, and give
   currency to their principles by blessings.

   Having thus in a few words, opened the merits of the case, I shall now
   proceed to the plan I have to propose, which is,

   To create a national fund, out of which there shall be paid to every
   person, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen
   pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her
   natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property;

   And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person
   now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall
   arrive at that age.

   MEANS BY WHICH THE FUND IS TO BE CREATED

   I have already established the principle, namely, that the earth, in its
   natural uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the
   common property of the human race; that in that state, every person would
   have been born to property; and that the system of landed property, by its
   inseparable connection with cultivation, and with what is called civilized
   life, has absorbed the property of all those whom it dispossessed, without
   providing, as ought to have been done, an indemnification for that loss.

   The fault, however, is not in the present possessors. No complaint is
   tended, or ought to be alleged against them, unless they adopt the crime
   by opposing justice. The fault is in the system, and it has stolen
   perceptibly upon the world, aided afterwards by the agrarian law of the
   sword. But the fault can be made to reform itself by successive
   generations; and without diminishing or deranging the property of any of
   present possessors, the operation of the fund can yet commence, and in
   full activity, the first year of its establishment, or soon after, as I
   shall show.

   It is proposed that the payments, as already stated, be made to every
   person, rich or poor. It is best to make it so, to prevent invidious
   distinctions. It is also right it should be so, because it is in lieu of
   the natural inheritance, which, as a right, belongs to every man, over and
   above property he may have created, or inherited from those who did. Such
   persons as do not choose to receive it can throw it into the common fund.

   Taking it then for granted that no person ought to be in a worse condition
   when born under what is called a state of civilization, than he would have
   been had he been born in a state of nature, and that civilization ought to
   have made, and ought still to make, provision for that purpose, it can
   only be done by subtracting from property a portion equal in value to the
   natural inheritance it has absorbed.

   Various methods may be proposed for this purpose, but that which appears
   to be the best (not only because it will operate without deranging any
   present possessors, or without interfering with the collection of taxes or
   emprunts necessary for the purposes of government and the Revolution, but
   because it will be the least troublesome and the most effectual, and also
   because the subtraction will be made at a time that best admits it) is at
   the moment that property is passing by the death of one person to the
   possession of another. In this case, the bequeather gives nothing: the
   receiver pays nothing. The only matter to him is that the monopoly of
   natural inheritance, to which there never was a right, begins to cease in
   his person. A generous man would not wish it to continue, and a just man
   will rejoice to see it abolished.

   My state of health prevents my making sufficient inquiries with respect to
   the doctrine of probabilities, whereon to found calculations with such
   degrees of certainty as they are capable of. What, therefore, I offer on
   this head is more the result of observation and reflection than of
   received information; but I believe it will be found to agree sufficiently
   with fact. In the first place, taking twenty-one years as the epoch of
   maturity, all the property of a nation, real and personal, is always in
   the possession of persons above that age. It is then necessary to know, as
   a datum of calculation, the average of years which persons above that age
   will live. I take this average to be about thirty years, for though many
   persons will live forty, fifty, or sixty years, after the age of
   twenty-one years, others will die much sooner, and some in every year of
   that time.

   Taking, then, thirty years as the average of time, it will give, without
   any material variation one way or other, the average of time in which the
   whole property or capital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will have
   passed through one entire revolution in descent, that is, will have gone
   by deaths to new possessors; for though, in many instances, some parts of
   this capital will remain forty, fifty, or sixty years in the possession of
   one person, other parts will have revolved two or three times before those
   thirty years expire, which will bring it to that average; for were
   one-half the capital of a nation to revolve twice in thirty years, it
   would produce the same fund as if the whole revolved once.

   Taking, then, thirty years as the average of time in which the whole
   capital of a nation, or a -sum equal thereto, will revolve once, the
   thirtieth part thereof will be the sum that will revolve every year, that
   is, will go by deaths to new possessors; and this last sum being thus
   known, and the ratio per cent to be subtracted from It determined, it will
   give the annual amount or income of the proposed fund, to be applied as
   already mentioned.

   In looking over the discourse of the English Minister, Pitt, in his
   opening of what is called in England the budget (the scheme of finance for
   the year 1796), I find an estimate of the national capital of that unity.
   As this estimate of a national capital is prepared ready to my hand, I
   take it as a datum to act upon. When a calculation is made upon the known
   capital of any nation, combined with its population, it will serve as a
   scale for any other nation, in proportion as its capital and population be
   more or less.

   I am the more disposed to take this estimate of Mr. Pitt, for the purpose
   of showing to that minister, upon his own calculation, how much better
   money may be employed than in wasting it, as he has done, on the wild
   project of setting up Bourbon kings. What, in the name of heaven, are
   Bourbon kings to the people of England? It is better that the people have
   bread.

   Mr. Pitt states the national capital of England, real and personal, to one
   thousand three hundred millions sterling, which is about one-fourth part
   of the national capital of France, including Belgia. The event of the last
   harvest in each country proves that the soil of France more productive
   than that of England, and that it can better support twenty-four or
   twenty-five millions of inhabitants than that of England of seven or seven
   and a half millions.

   The thirtieth part of this capital of -L- 1,300,000,000 is -L- 43,333,333
   which the part that will revolve every year by deaths in that country to
   new possessors; and the sum that will annually revolve in France in the
   proportion of four to one, will be about one hundred and seventy-three
   millions sterling. From this sum of -L- 43,333,333 annually revolving, is
   be subtracted the value of the natural inheritance absorbed in it, which,
   perhaps, in fair justice, cannot be taken at less, and ought not be taken
   for more, than a tenth part.

   It will always happen that of the property thus revolving by deaths every
   year a part will descend in a direct line to sons and daughters, and other
   part collaterally, and the proportion will be found to be about three to
   one; that is, about thirty millions of the above sum will descend to
   direct heirs, and the remaining sum of -L- 413,333,333 to more distant
   relations, and in part to strangers.

   Considering, then, that man is always related to society, that
   relationship will become comparatively greater in proportion as the next
   of kin is more distant; it is therefore consistent with civilization to
   say that where there are no direct heirs society shall be heir to a part
   over and above the tenth part due to society.

   If this additional part be from five to ten or twelve per cent, in
   proportion as the next of kin be nearer or more remote, so as to average
   with the escheats that may fall, which ought always to go to society and
   not to the government (an addition of ten per cent more), the produce from
   the annual sum of -L- 43,333,333 will be:

   From -L- 30,000,000 at ten per
   cent...............................................................-L-
   3,000,000

   From -L- 13,333,333 at ten per cent with the addition of ten per cent
   more....-L- 2,666,666
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -L- 43,333,333  -L- 5,666,666

   Having thus arrived at the annual amount of the proposed fund, I come, in
   the next place, to speak of the population proportioned to this fund and
   to compare it with the uses to which the fund is to be applied.

   The population (I mean that of England) does not exceed seven millions and
   a half, and the number of persons above the age of fifty will in that case
   be about four hundred thousand. There would not, however, be more than
   that number that would accept the proposed ten pounds sterling per annum,
   though they would be entitled.  I have no idea it would be accepted by
   many persons who had a yearly income of two or three hundred pounds
   sterling. But as we often see instances of rich people falling into sudden
   poverty, even at the age of sixty, they would always have the right of
   drawing all the arrears clue to them. Four millions, therefore, of the
   above annual sum of -L- 5,666,666 will be required for four hundred
   thousand aged persons, at ten pounds sterling each.

   I come now to speak of the persons annually arriving at twenty-one years
   of age. If all the persons who died were above the age of twenty-one
   years, the number of persons annually arriving at that age must be equal
   to the annual number of deaths, to keep the population stationary. But the
   greater part die under the age of twenty-one, and therefore the number of
   persons annually arriving at twenty-one will be less than half the number
   of deaths.

   The whole number of deaths upon a population of seven millions and a half
   will be about 220,000 annually. The number arriving at twenty-one years of
   age will be about 100,000. The whole number of these will not receive the
   proposed fifteen pounds, for the reasons already mentioned, though, as in
   the former case, they would be entitled to it. Admitting then that a tenth
   part declined receiving it, the amount would stand thus:



   Fund
   annually.................................................................................-L-
   5,666,666
   To 400,000 aged persons at -L- 10 each .......................-L-
   4,000,000
   To 90,000 persons of 21 yrs.-L- 15 each.......................-L-
   1,350,000
   -L- 5,350,000
   ---------------
   Remains: -L- 316,666



   There are, in every country, a number of blind and lame person totally
   incapable of earning a livelihood. But as it will always happen that the
   greater number of blind persons will be among those who are above the age
   of fifty years, they will be provided for in that class. Th remaining sum
   of -L- 316,666 will provide for the lame and blind under that age, at the
   same rate of -L- 10 annually for each person.

   Having now gone through all the necessary calculations, and stated the
   particulars of the plan, I shall conclude with some observations. It is
   not charity but a right, not bounty but justice, that I am pleading for.
   The present state of civilization is as odious as it is unjust. It is
   absolutely the opposite of what it should be, and it is necessary that a
   revolution should be made in it. The contrast of affluence and
   wretchedness continually meeting and offending the eye, is like dead and
   living bodies chained together. Though I care as little about riches as
   any man, I am a friend to riches because they are capable of good.

   I care not how affluent some may be, provided that none be miserable in
   consequence of it. But it is impossible to enjoy affluence with the
   felicity it is capable of being enjoyed, while so much misery is mingled
   in the scene. The sight of the misery, and the unpleasant sensations it
   suggests, which, though they may be suffocated cannot be extinguished, are
   a greater drawback upon the felicity of affluence than the proposed ten
   per cent upon property is worth. He that would not give the one to get rid
   of the other has no charity, even for himself.

   There are, in every country, some magnificent charities established by
   individuals. It is, however, but little that any individual can do, when
   the whole extent of the misery to be relieved is considered. He may
   satisfy his conscience, but not his heart. He may give all that he has,
   and that all will relieve but little. It is only by organizing
   civilization upon such principles as to act like a system of pulleys, that
   the whole weight of misery can be removed.

   The plan here proposed will reach the whole. It will immediately relieve
   and take out of view three classes of wretchedness-the blind, the lame,
   and the aged poor; and it will furnish the rising generation with means to
   prevent their becoming poor; and it will do this without deranging or
   interfering with any national measures.

   To show that this will be the case, it is sufficient to observe that the
   operation and effect of the plan will, in all cases, be the same as if
   every individual were voluntarily to make his will and dispose of his
   property in the manner here proposed.

   But it is justice, and not charity, that is the principle of the plan. In
   all great cases it is necessary to have a principle more universally
   active than charity; and, with respect to justice, it ought not to be left
   to the choice of detached individuals whether they will do justice or not.
   Considering, then, the plan on the ground of justice, it ought to be the
   act of the whole growing spontaneously out of the principles of the
   revolution, and the reputation of it ought to be national and not
   individual.

   A plan upon this principle would benefit the revolution by the energy that
   springs from the consciousness of justice. It would multiply also the
   national resources; for property, like vegetation, increases by offsets.
   When a young couple begin the world, the difference is exceedingly great
   whether they begin with nothing or with fifteen pounds apiece. With this
   aid they could buy a cow, and implements to cultivate a few acres of land;
   and instead of becoming burdens upon society, which is always the case
   where children are produced faster than they can be fed, would be put in
   the way of becoming useful and profitable citizens. The national domains
   also would sell the better if pecuniary aids were provided to cultivate
   them in small lots.

   It is the practice of what has unjustly obtained the name of civilization
   (and the practice merits not to be called either charity or policy) to
   make some provision for persons becoming poor and wretched only at the
   time they become so. Would it not, even as a matter of economy, be far
   better to adopt means to prevent their becoming poor? This can best be
   done by making every person when arrived at the age of twenty-one years an
   inheritor of something to begin with.

   The rugged face of society, checkered with the extremes of affluence and
   want, proves that some extraordinary violence has been committed upon it,
   and calls on justice for redress. The great mass of the poor in countries
   are become an hereditary race, and it is next to impossible them to get
   out of that state of themselves. It ought also to be observed that this
   mass increases in all countries that are called civilized. re persons fall
   annually into it than get out of it.

   Though in a plan of which justice and humanity are the foundation
   principles, interest ought not to be admitted into the calculation, yet it
   is always of advantage to the establishment of any plan to show that it
   beneficial as a matter of interest. The success of any proposed plan
   submitted to public consideration must finally depend on the numbers
   interested in supporting it, united with the justice of its principles.

   The plan here proposed will benefit all, without injuring any. It will
   consolidate the interest of the republic with that of the individual. To
   the numerous class dispossessed of their natural inheritance by the system
   of landed property it will be an act of national justice. To persons dying
   possessed of moderate fortunes it will operate as a tontine to their
   children, more beneficial than the sum of money paid into the fund: and it
   will give to the accumulation of riches a degree of security that none of
   old governments of Europe, now tottering on their foundations, can give.

   I do not suppose that more than one family in ten, in any of the countries
   of Europe, has, when the head of the family dies, a clear property of five
   hundred pounds sterling. To all such the plan is advantageous. That
   property would pay fifty pounds into the fund, and if there were only two
   children under age they would receive fifteen pounds each (thirty pounds),
   on coming of age, and be entitled to ten pounds a year after fifty.

   It is from the overgrown acquisition of property that the fund will
   support itself; and I know that the possessors of such property in
   England, though they would eventually be benefitted by the protection of
   nine-tenths of it, will exclaim against the plan. But without entering any
   inquiry how they came by that property, let them recollect that they have
   been the advocates of this war, and that Mr. Pitt has already laid on more
   new taxes to be raised annually upon the people of England, and that for
   supporting the despotism of Austria and the Bourbons against the liberties
   of France, than would pay annually all the sums proposed in this plan.

   I have made the calculations stated in this plan, upon what is called
   personal, as well as upon landed property. The reason for making it upon
   land is already explained; and the reason for taking personal property
   into the calculation is equally well founded though on a different
   principle. Land, as before said, is the free gift of the Creator in common
   to the human race. Personal property is the effect of society; and it is
   as impossible for an individual to acquire personal property without the
   aid of society, as it is for him to make land originally.

   Separate an individual from society, and give him an island or a continent
   to possess, and he cannot acquire personal property. He cannot be rich. So
   inseparably are the means connected with the end, in all cases, that where
   the former do not exist the latter cannot be obtained. All accumulation,
   therefore, of personal property, beyond what a man's own hands produce, is
   derived to him by living in society; and he owes on every principle of
   justice, of gratitude, and of civilization, a part of that accumulation
   back again to society from whence the whole came.

   This is putting the matter on a general principle, and perhaps it is best
   to do so; for if we examine the case minutely it will be found that the
   accumulation of personal property is, in many instances, the effect of
   paying too little for the labor that produced it; the consequence of which
   is that the working hand perishes in old age, and the employer abounds in
   affluence.

   It is, perhaps, impossible to proportion exactly the price of labor to the
   profits it produces; and it will also be said, as an apology for the
   injustice, that were a workman to receive an increase of wages daily he
   would not save it against old age, nor be much better for it in the
   interim. Make, then, society the treasurer to guard it for him in a common
   fund; for it is no reason that, because he might not make a good use of it
   for himself, another should take it.

   The state of civilization that has prevailed throughout Europe, is as
   unjust in its principle, as it is horrid in its effects; and it is the
   consciousness of this, and the apprehension that such a state cannot
   continue when once investigation begins in any country, that makes the
   possessors of property dread every idea of a revolution. It is the hazard
   and not the principle of revolutions that retards their progress. This
   being the case, it is necessary as well for the protection of property as
   for the sake of justice and humanity, to form a system that, while it
   preserves one part of society from wretchedness, shall secure the other
   from depreciation.

   The superstitious awe, the enslaving reverence, that formerly surrounded
   affluence, is passing away in all countries, and leaving the possessor of
   property to the convulsion of accidents. When wealth and splendor, instead
   of fascinating the multitude, excite emotions of disgust; n, instead of
   drawing forth admiration, it is beheld as an insult on wretchedness; when
   the ostentatious appearance it makes serves call the right of it in
   question, the case of property becomes critical, and it is only in a
   system of justice that the possessor can contemplate security.

   To remove the danger, it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and this
   can only be done by making property productive of a national bless,
   extending to every individual. When the riches of one man above other
   shall increase the national fund in the same proportion; when it shall be
   seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the prosperity of
   individuals; when the more riches a man acquires, the better it shall for
   the general mass; it is then that antipathies will cease, and property be
   placed on the permanent basis of national interest and protection.

   I have no property in France to become subject to the plan I prose. What I
   have, which is not much, is in the United States of America. But I will
   pay one hundred pounds sterling toward this fund in France, the instant it
   shall be established; and I will pay the same sum England, whenever a
   similar establishment shall take place in that country.

   A revolution in the state of civilization is the necessary companion of
   revolutions in the system of government. If a revolution in any country be
   from bad to good, or from good to bad, the state of what is called
   civilization in that country, must be made conformable thereto, to giveth
   at revolution effect.

   Despotic government supports itself by abject civilization, in which
   debasement of the human mind, and wretchedness in the mass of the people,
   are the chief criterions. Such governments consider man merely as an
   animal; that the exercise of intellectual faculty is not his privilege;
   that he has nothing to do with the laws but to obey them; and they
   politically depend more upon breaking the spirit of the people by poverty,
   than they fear enraging it by desperation.

   It is a revolution in the state of civilization that will give perfection
   to Revolution of France. Already the conviction that government by
   representation is the true system of government is spreading itself fast
   in the world. The reasonableness of it can be seen by all. The justness of
   it makes itself felt even by its opposers. But when a system of
   civilization, (growing out of that system of government) shall be so
   organized that not a man or woman born in the Republic but shall inherit
   some means of beginning the world, and see before them the certainty of
   escaping the miseries that under other governments accompany old age, the
   Revolution of France will have an advocate and an ally in the heart of all
   nations.

   An army of principles will penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot; it
   will succeed where diplomatic management would fall: it is neither the
   Rhine, the Channel, nor the ocean that can arrest its progress: it will
   march on the horizon of the world, and it will conquer.

   MEANS FOR CARRYING THE PROPOSED PLAN INTO EXECUTION, AND TO RENDER IT AT
   THE SAME TIME CONDUCIVE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST

   I. Each canton shall elect in its primary assemblies, three persons, as
   commissioners for that canton, who shall take cognizance, and keep a
   register of all matters happening in that canton, conformable to the
   charter that shall be established by law for carrying this plan into
   execution.

   II. The law shall fix the manner in which the property of deceased persons
   shall be ascertained.

   III. When the amount of the property of any deceased persons shall be
   ascertained, the principal heir to that property, or the eldest of the
   co-heirs, if of lawful age, or if under age, the person authorized by the
   ill of the deceased to represent him or them, shall give bond to the
   commissioners of the canton to pay the said tenth part thereof in four
   equal quarterly payments, within the space of one year or sooner, at the
   choice of the payers. One-half of the whole property shall remain as a
   security until the bond be paid off.

   IV. The bond shall be registered in the office of the commissioners of the
   canton, and the original bonds shall be deposited in the national bank at
   Paris. The bank shall publish every quarter of a year the amount of the
   bonds in its possession, and also the bonds that shall have been paid off,
   or what parts thereof, since the last quarterly publication.

   V. The national bank shall issue bank notes upon the security of the bonds
   in its possession. The notes so issued, shall be applied to pay the
   pensions of aged persons, and the compensations to persons arriving at
   twenty-one years of age. It is both reasonable and generous to suppose,
   that persons not under immediate necessity, will suspend their right of
   drawing on the fund, until it acquire, as it will do, a greater degree of
   ability. In this case, it is proposed, that an honorary register be kept,
   in each canton, of the names of the persons thus suspending that right, at
   least during the present war.

   VI. As the inheritors of property must always take up their bonds in four
   quarterly payments, or sooner if they choose, there will always be
   numeraire arriving at the bank after the expiration of the first quarter,
   to exchange for the bank notes that shall be brought in.

   VII. The bank notes being thus put in circulation, upon the best of all
   possible security, that of actual property, to more than four times the a
   mount of the bonds upon which the notes are issued, and with numeraire
   continually arriving at the bank to exchange or pay them off whenever they
   shall be presented for that purpose, they will acquire a permanent value
   in all parts of the Republic. They can therefore be received in payment of
   taxes, or emprunts equal to numeraire, because the Government can always
   receive numeraire for them at the bank.

   VIII. It will be necessary that the payments of the ten per cent be made
   in numeraire for the first year from the establishment of the plan. But
   after the expiration of the first year, the inheritors of property may pay
   ten per cent either in bank notes issued upon the fund, or in numeraire.

   IX. If the payments be in numeraire, it will lie as a deposit at the bank,
   be exchanged for a quantity of notes equal to that amount; and if in notes
   issued upon the fund, it will cause a demand upon the fund equal thereto;
   and thus the operation of the plan will create means to carry itself into
   execution.

   Thomas Paine

   1.  Paine is referring to the Constitution of 1793. The clause Paine
   objected to granted citizenship to Frenchmen of twenty-one only if they
   paid a direct land or personalproperty tax and were enrolled upon their
   cantonal civic register. All citizens might vote in the primary or
   cantonal assemblies for electors. To be an elector, one had to be
   proprietor, usufructuary, or occupant of a habitation producing an income
   ranging from one hundred or two hundred days of labor.

   2.  Babeuf developed one of the earliest theories of communism. He headed
   the Secret
   Directory of Public Safety which organized the insurrection in May, 1796.
   Among the
   demands the Secret Directory raised at the time were: the abolition of the
   right of in-
   heritance; the confiscation of the properties of those persons who
   neglected to cultivate
   their lands and of individuals who lived without working, and the
   establishment of public
   stores in each commune. The insurrection was crushed and Babeuf died on
   the guillotine
   on May 28, 1797.

   It is significant to note that Paine supported the communistic aspects of
   Babeuf's theories, and that, although he-decried the violent aspects of
   the Babeuf insurrection, he considered it as being correctly aimed at the
   removal of social inequalities in property.

   For an excellent analysis of the Babeuf insurrection as well as the
   theories of Babouvism, see Samuel Bernstein, "Babeuf and Babouvism,"
   Science and Society, Vol. II, pp. 29-57; 166-194.
