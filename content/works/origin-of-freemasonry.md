   Philip Foner's introduction:

   In this essay, written in New York City in 1805, Paine developed the
   thesis that Masonry was descended from the religion of the Druids. The
   essay was not published during Paine's lifetime, but appeared in 1810 in
   fragmentary form, edited by Madame Bonneville, Paine's executrix, who
   omitted certain references which offended her Roman Catholic leanings. In
   1818 it was published as a pamphlet with an anonymous preface stating:
   "This tract is a chapter belonging to the Third Part of The Age of Reason,
   as will be seen by the references made in it to preceding articles, as
   forming part of the same work."

   IT is always understood that Freemasons have a secret which they carefully
   conceal; but from everything that can be collected from their own accounts
   of Masonry, their real secret is no other than their origin, which but few
   of them understand; and those who do, envelop it in mystery. The Society
   of Masons are distinguished into three classes or degrees. 1 st. The
   Entered Apprentice. 2d. The Fellow Craft. 3d. The Master Mason.

   The Entered Apprentice knows but little more of Masonry than the use of
   signs and tokens, and certain steps and words by which Masons can
   recognize each other without being discovered by a person who is not a
   Mason. The Fellow Craft is not much better instructed in Masonry than the
   Entered Apprentice. It is only in the Master Mason's Lodge that whatever
   knowledge remains of the origin of Masonry is preserved and concealed.

   In 1730, Samuel Pritchard, member of a constituted lodge in England,
   published a treatise entitled "Masonry Dissected"; and made oath before
   the Lord Mayor of London that it was a true copy. "Samuel Pritchard maketh
   oath that the copy hereunto annexed is a true and genuine copy in every
   particular." In his work he has given the catechism or examination, in
   question and answer, of the Apprentices, the Fellow Craft, and the Master
   Mason. There was no difficulty in doing this, as it is mere form.

   In his introduction he says, "the original institution of Masonry
   consisted in the foundation of the liberal arts and sciences, but more
   especially in geometry, for at the building of the tower of Babel the art
   and mystery of Masonry was first introduced, and from thence handed down
   by Euclid, a worthy and excellent mathematician of the Egyptians; and he
   communicated it to Hiram, the Master Mason concerned in building Solomon's
   Temple in Jerusalem."

   Besides the absurdity of deriving Masonry from the building of Babel,
   where, according to the story, the confusion of languages prevented the
   builders understanding each other, and consequently of communicating any
   knowledge they had, there is a glaring contradiction in point of
   chronology in the account he gives.

   Solomon's Temple was built and dedicated 1004 years before the Christian
   era; and Euclid, as may be seen in the tables of chronology, lived 277
   before the same era. It was therefore impossible that Euclid could
   communicate anything to Hiram, since Euclid did not live till seven
   hundred years after the time of Hiram.

   In 1783, Captain George Smith, inspector of the Royal Artillery Academy at
   Woolwich, in England, and Provincial Grand Master of Masonry for the
   County of Kent, published a treatise entitled, "The Use and Abuse of
   Freemasonry."

   In his chapter of the antiquity of Masonry he makes it to be coeval with
   creation, "when," says he, "the sovereign architect raised on Masonic
   principles the beauteous globe, and commanded the master science,
   geometry, to lay the planetary world, and to regulate by its laws the
   whole stupendous system in just, unerring proportion, rolling round the
   central sun.

   "But," continues he, "I am not at liberty publicly to undraw the curtain
   and openly to descant on this head; it is sacred, and ever will remain so;
   those who are honored with the trust will not reveal it, and those who are
   ignorant of it cannot betray it."

   By this last part of the phrase, Smith means the two inferior classes, the
   Fellow Craft and the Entered Apprentice, for he says in the next page of
   his work, "It is not every one that is barely initiated into Freemasonry
   that is entrusted with all the mysteries thereto belonging; they are not
   attainable as things of course, nor by every capacity."

   The learned, but unfortunate Doctor Dodd, Grand Chaplain of Masonry, in
   his oration at the dedication of Freemason's Hall, London, traces Masonry
   through a variety of stages. "Masons," says he, "are well informed from
   their own private and interior records that the building of Solomon's
   Temple is an important era, from whence they derive many mysteries of
   their art.

   "Now," says he, "be it remembered that this great event took place above
   one thousand years before the Christian era, and consequently more than a
   century before Homer, the first of the Grecian poets, wrote; and about
   five centuries before Pythagoras brought from the East his sublime system
   of truly Masonic instruction to illuminate our western world. But, remote
   as this period is, we date not from thence the commencement of our art.
   For though it might owe to the wise and glorious King of Israel some of
   its many mystic forms and hieroglyphic ceremonies, yet certainly the art
   itself is coeval with man, the great subject of it.

   "We trace," continues he, "its footsteps in the most distant, the most
   remote ages and nations of the world. We find it among the first and most
   celebrated civilizers of the East. We deduce it regularly from the first
   astronomers on the plains of Chaldea, to the wise and mystic kings and
   priests of Egypt, the sages of Greece, and the philosophers of Rome."

   From these reports and declarations of Masons of the highest order in the
   institution, we see that Masonry, without publicly declaring so, lays
   claim to some divine communication from the Creator, in a manner different
   from, and unconnected with, the book which the Christians call the Bible;
   and the natural result from this is that Masonry is derived from some very
   ancient religion, wholly independent of and unconnected with that book.

   To come then at once to the point, Masonry (as I shall show from the
   customs, ceremonies, hieroglyphics and chronology of Masonry) is derived
   and is the remains of the religion of the ancient Druids; who, like the
   magi of Persia and the priests of Heliopolis in Egypt, were priests of the
   sun. They paid worship to this great luminary, as the great visible agent
   of a great invisible first cause, whom they styled "Time without limits."

   The Christian religion and Masonry have one and the same common origin:
   both are derived from the worship of the sun. The difference between their
   origin is that the Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the
   sun, in which they put a man whom they call Christ in the place of the
   sun, and pay him the same adoration which was originally paid to the sun,
   as I have shown in the chapter on the origin of the Christian religion.

   In Masonry many of the ceremonies of the Druids are preserved in their
   original state, at least without any parody. With them the sun is still
   the sun; and his image in the form of the sun is the great emblematical
   ornament of Masonic lodges and Masonic dresses. It is the central figure
   on their aprons, and they wear it also pendant on the breast in their
   lodges and in their processions. It has the figure of a man, as at the
   head of the sun, as Christ is always represented.

   At what period of antiquity, or in what nation, this religion was first
   established, is lost in the labyrinth of unrecorded time. It is generally
   ascribed to the ancient Egyptians, the Babylonians and Chaldeans, and
   reduced afterwards to a system regulated by the apparent progress of the
   sun through the twelve signs of zodiac by Zoroaster the lawgiver of
   Persia, from whence Pythagoras brought it into Greece. It is to these
   matters Dr. Dodd refers in the passage already quoted from his oration.

   The worship of the sun as the great visible agent of a great invisible
   first cause, "Time without limits," spread itself over a considerable part
   of Asia and Africa, from thence to Greece and Rome, through all ancient
   Gaul, and into Britain and Ireland.

   Smith, in his chapter on the antiquity of Masonry in Britain, says, that
   "notwithstanding the obscurity which envelops Masonic history in that
   country, various circumstances contribute to prove that Freemasonry was
   introduced into Britain about 1,030 years before Christ."

   It cannot be Masonry in its present state that Smith here alludes to. The
   Druids flourished in Britain at the period he speaks of, and it is from
   them that Masonry is descended. Smith has put the child in the place of
   the parent.

   It sometimes happens, as well in writing as in conversation, that a person
   lets slip an expression that serves to unravel what he intends to conceal,
   and this is the case with Smith, for in the same chapter he says, "The
   Druids, when they committed anything to writing, used the Greek alphabet,
   and I am bold to assert that the most perfect remains of the Druids' rites
   and ceremonies are preserved in the customs and ceremonies of the Masons
   that are to be found existing among mankind. My brethren," says he, "may
   be able to trace them with greater exactness than I am at liberty to
   explain to the public."

   This is a confession from a Master Mason, without intending it to be so
   understood by the public, that Masonry is the remains of the religion of
   the Druids; the reasons for the Masons keeping this a secret I shall
   explain in the course of this work.

   As the study and contemplation of the Creator [is] in the works of the
   creation, the sun, as the great visible agent of that Being, was the
   visible object of the adoration of Druids; all their religious rites and
   ceremonies had reference to the apparent progress of the sun through the
   twelve signs of the zodiac, and his influence upon the earth.

   The Masons adopt the same practises. The roof of their temples or lodges
   is ornamented with a sun, and the floor is a representation of the
   variegated face of the earth either by carpeting or mosaic work.

   Freemasons' Hall, in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, is
   a magnificent building, and cost upward of 12,000 pounds sterling. Smith,
   in speaking of this building, says (page 152), "The roof of this
   magnificent hall is in all probability the highest piece of finished
   architecture in Europe. In the center of this roof, a most resplendent sun
   is represented in burnished gold, surrounded with the twelve signs of the
   zodiac, with their respective characters:

   (here are represented the chart of the signs of the zodiac)

   After giving this description, he says, "The emblematical meaning of the
   sun is well known to the enlightened and inquisitive Freemason; and as the
   real sun is situated in the center of the universe, so the emblematical
   sun is the center of real Masonry. We all know," continues he, "that the
   sun is the fountain of light, the source of the seasons, the cause of the
   vicissitudes of day and night, the parent of vegetation, the friend of
   man; hence the scientific Freemason only knows the reason why the sun is
   placed in the center of this beautiful hall."

   The Masons, in order to protect themselves from the persecution of the
   Christian Church, have always spoken in a mystical manner of the figure of
   the sun in their lodges, or, like the astronomer Lalande, who is a Mason,
   been silent upon the subject.

   It is their secret, especially in Catholic countries, because the figure
   of the sun is the expressive criterion that denotes they are descended
   from the Druids, and that wise, elegant, philosophical religion was the
   faith opposite to the faith of the gloomy Christian Church.

   The lodges of the Masons, if built for the purpose, are constructed in a
   manner to correspond with the apparent motion of the sun. They are
   situated East and West. The master's place is always in the East. In the
   examination of an Entered Apprentice, the master, among many other
   questions, asks him,

   Q. "How is the lodge situated?"

   A. "East and West."

   Q. "Why so?"

   A. "Because all churches and chapels are, or ought to be so."

   This answer, which is mere catechismal form, is not an answer to the
   question. It does no more than remove the question a point further, which
   is, why ought all churches and chapels to be so? But as the Entered
   Apprentice is not initiated into the druidical mysteries of Masonry, he is
   not asked any questions a direct answer to which would lead thereto.

   Q. "Where stands your master?"

   A. "In the East."

   Q. "Why so?"

   A. "As the sun rises in the East and opens the day, so the master stands
   in the East (with his right hand upon his left breast, being a sign, and
   the square about his neck), to open the lodge, and set his men at work."

   Q. "Where stand your wardens?"

   A. "In the West."

   Q. "What is their business?"

   A. "As the sun sets in the West to close the day, so the wardens stand in
   the West (with their right hands upon their left breasts, being a sign,
   and the level and plumb rule about their necks), to close the lodge, and
   dismiss the men from labor, paying them their wages."

   Here the name of the sun is mentioned, but it is proper to observe that in
   this place it has reference only to labor or to the time of labor, and not
   to any religious druidical rite or ceremony, as it would have with respect
   to the situation of lodges East and West.

   I have already observed in the chapter on the origin of the Christian
   religion, that the situation of churches East and West is taken from the
   worship of the sun, which rises in the East, and has not the least
   reference to the person called Jesus Christ.

   The Christians never bury their dead on the North side of a church; and a
   Mason's lodge always has, or is supposed to have, three windows which are
   called fixed lights, to distinguish them from the movable lights of the
   sun and the moon. The master asks the Entered Apprentice,

   Q. "How are they (the fixed lights) situated?"

   A. "East, West and South."

   Q. "What are their uses?"

   A. "To light the men to and from their work."

   Q. "Why are there no lights in the North?"

   A. "Because the sun darts no rays from thence."

   This, among numerous other instances, shows that the Christian religion
   and Masonry have one and the same common origin, the ancient worship of
   the sun.

   The high festival of the Masons is on the day they call St. John's day;
   but every enlightened Mason must know that holding their festival on this
   day has no reference to the person called St. John, and that it is only to
   disguise the true cause of holding it on this day, that they call the day
   by that name. As there were Masons, or at least Druids, many centuries
   before the time of St. John, if such person ever existed, the holding
   their festival on this day must refer to some cause totally unconnected
   with John.

   The case is that the day called St. John's day is the twenty-fourth day of
   June, and is what is called mid-summer day. The sun is then arrived at the
   summer solstice; and, with respect to his meridinal altitude, or height at
   high noon, appears for some days to be of the same height.

   The astronomical longest day, like the shortest day, is not every year, on
   account of leap year, on the same numerical day, and therefore the
   twenty-fourth of June is always taken for midsummer day; and it is in
   honor of the sun, which has then arrived at his greatest height in our
   hemisphere, and not anything with respect to St. John, that this annual
   festival of the Masons, taken from the Druids, is celebrated on mid-summer
   day.

   Customs will often outlive the remembrance of their origin, and this is
   the case with respect to a custom still practised in Ireland, where the
   Druids flourished at the time they flourished in Britain.

   On the eve of St. John's day, that is, on the eve of midsummer day, the
   Irish light fires on the tops of the hills. This can have no reference to
   St. John; but it has emblematical reference to the sun, which on that day
   is at his highest summer elevation, and might in common language be said
   to have arrived at the top of the hill.

   As to what Masons, and books of Masonry, tell us of Solomon's Temple at
   Jerusalem, it is no wise improbable that some Masonic ceremonies may have
   been derived from the building of that temple, for the worship of the sun
   was in practise many centuries before the temple existed, or before the
   Israelites came out of Egypt. And we learn from the history of the Jewish
   kings, II Kings xxii, xxiii, that the worship of the sun was performed by
   the Jews in that temple.

   It is, however, much to be doubted if it was done with the same scientific
   purity and religious morality with which it was performed by the Druids,
   who, by all accounts that historically remain of them, were a wise,
   learned, and moral class of men. The Jews, on the contrary, were ignorant
   of astronomy, and of science in general, and if a religion founded upon
   astronomy fell into their hands, it is almost certain it would be
   corrupted.

    We do not read in the history of the Jews, whether in the Bible or
   elsewhere, that they were the inventors or the improvers of any one art or
   science. Even in the building of this temple, the Jews did not know how to
   square and frame the timber for beginning and carrying on the work, and
   Solomon was obliged to send to Hiram,' King of Tyre (Zidon), to procure
   workmen; "for thou knowest" (says Solomon to Hiram, I Kings v, 6), "that
   there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the
   Zidonians."

   This temple was more properly Hiram's Temple than Solomon's, and if the
   Masons derive anything from the building of it, they owe it to the
   Zidonians and not to the Jews. But to return to the worship of the sun in
   this temple.

   It is said, II Kings xxiii, 5, "And [King Josiah] put down all the
   idolatrous priests . . . that burned incense unto . . . the sun, the moon,
   the planets, and all the host of heaven." And it is said at the eleventh
   verse: "And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to
   the sun, at the entering in of the house of the Lord . . . and burned the
   chariots of the sun with fire"; verse 13, "And the high places that were
   before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of cor-
   ruption, which Solomon the King of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth, the
   abomination of the Zidonians" (the very people that built the temple) "did
   the king defile."

   Besides these things, the description that Josephus gives of the
   decorations of this temple, resembles on a large scale those of a Mason's
   lodge. He says that the distribution of the several parts of the Temple of
   the Jews represented all nature, particularly the parts most apparent of
   it, as the sun, moon, the planets, the zodiac, the earth, the elements;
   and that the system of the world was retraced there by numerous ingenious
   emblems.

   These, in all probability, are, what Josiah, in his ignorance, calls the
   abominations of the Zidonians. (Smith, in speaking of a lodge, says, when
   the lodge is revealed to an entering Mason, it discovers to him a
   representation of the World; in which, from the wonders of nature, w e are
   led to contemplate her great Original, and worship H i m from His mighty w
   o r k s ; and we are thereby also moved to exercise those moral and social
   virtues which become mankind as the servants of the great Architect of the
   world.-Author.) Everything, however, drawn from this temple, (It may not
   be improper here to observe, that the law called the Law of Moses could
   not have been in existence at the time of building this Temple. Here is
   the likeness of things in heaven above and in earth beneath. And we read
   in I Kings, vi, vii, that Solomon made cherubs and cherubim, that he
   carved all the walls of the house round about with cherubim, and
   palm-trees, and open flowers, and that he made a molten sea, placed on
   twelve oxen, and the ledges of it were ornamented with lions, oxen, and
   cherubim: all this is contrary to the law called the Law of
   Moses.-Author.) and applied to Masonry, still refers to the worship of the
   sun, however corrupted or misunderstood by the Jews, and consequently to
   the religion of the Druids.

   Another circumstance, which shows that Masonry is derived from some
   ancient system, prior to and unconnected with the Christian religion, is
   the chronology, or method of counting time, used by the Masons in the
   records of their lodges. They make no use of what is called the Christian
   era; and they reckon their months numerically, as the ancient Egyptians
   did, and as the Quakers do now.

   I have by me a record of a French lodge, at the time the late Duke of
   Orleans, then Duke de Chartres, was Grand Master of Masonry in France. It
   begins as follows: "Le trentieme jour du sixieme mois de Van de la V. L.
   cinq mille sept cent soixante treize"; that is, the thirteenth day of the
   sixth month of the year of the Venerable Lodge, 5773.

   By what I observe in English books of Masonry, the English Masons use the
   initials A. L. and not V. L. By A. L. they mean in the year of Light, as
   the Christians by A. D. mean in the year of our Lord. But A. L. like V. L.
   refers to the same chronological era, that is, to the supposed time of the
   Creation.

   In the chapter on the origin of the Christian religion I have shown that
   the cosmogony, that is, the account of the Creation with which the book of
   Genesis opens, has been taken and mutilated from the Zend-Avesta of
   Zoroaster, and was fixed as a preface to the Bible after the Jews returned
   from captivity in Babylon, and that the rabbins of the Jews do not hold
   their account in Genesis to be a fact, but mere allegory. The six thousand
   years in the Zend-Avesta, is changed or interpolated into six days in the
   account of Genesis.

   The Masons appear to have chosen the same period, and perhaps to avoid the
   suspicion and persecution of the Church, have adopted the era of the world
   as the era of Masonry. The V. L. of the French, and A. L. of the English
   Mason, answer to the A. M. Anno Mundi, or year of the world.

   Though the Masons have taken many of their ceremonies and hieroglyphics
   from the ancient Egyptians, it is certain they have not taken their
   chronology from thence. If they had, the Church would soon have sent them
   to the stake; as the chronology of the Egyptians, like that of the
   Chinese, goes many thousand years beyond the Bible chronology.

   The religion of the Druids, as before said, was the same as the religion
   of the ancient Egyptians. The priests of Egypt were the professors and
   teachers of science, and were styled priests of Heliopolis, that is, of
   the City of the Sun.

   The Druids in Europe, who were the same order of men, have their name from
   the Teutonic or ancient German language; the Germans being anciently
   called Teutones. The word Druid signifies a wise man. In Persia they were
   called magi, which signifies the same thing.

   "Egypt," says Smith, "from whence we derive many of our mysteries, has
   always borne a distinguished rank in history, and was once celebrated
   above all others for its antiquities, learning, opulence and fertility. In
   their system, their principal hero-gods, Osiris and Isis, theologically
   represented the Supreme Being and universal nature; and physically the two
   great celestial luminaries, the sun and the moon, by whose influence all
   nature was actuated.

   "The experienced brethren of the Society," says Smith in a note to this
   passage, "are well informed what affinity these symbols bear to Masonry,
   and why they are used in all Masonic lodges."

   In speaking of the apparel of the Masons in their lodges, part of which,
   as we see in their public processions, is a white leather apron, he says,
   "the Druids were appareled in white at the time of their sacrifices and
   solemn offices. The Egyptian priests of Osiris wore snow-white cotton. The
   Grecian and most other priests wore white garments. As Masons, we regard
   the principles of those who were the first worshipers of the true God,
   imitate their apparel, and assume the badge of innocence."

   "The Egyptians," continues Smith, "in the earliest ages constituted a
   great number of lodges, but with assiduous care kept their secrets of
   Masonry from all strangers. These secrets have been imperfectly handed
   down to us by oral tradition only, and ought to be kept undiscovered to
   the laborers, craftsmen, and apprentices, till by good behavior and long
   study they become better acquainted in geometry and the liberal arts, and
   thereby qualified for masters and wardens, which is seldom or never the
   case with English Masons."

   Under the head of Freemasonry, written by the astronomer Lalande. in the
   French Encyclopedia, I expected from his great knowledge in astronomy to
   have found much information on the origin of Masonry; for what connection
   can there be between any institution and the sun and twelve signs of the
   zodiac, if there be not something in that institution, or in its origin,
   that has reference to astronomy?

   Everything used as a hieroglyphic has reference to the subject and purpose
   for which it is used, and we are not to suppose the Freemasons, among whom
   are many very learned and scientific men, to be such idiots as to make use
   of astronomical signs without some astronomical purpose.

   But I was much disappointed in my expectation from Lalande. In speaking of
   the origin of Masonry, he says, "U origine de la maconiere se perd, comme
   tant d' autres dans V obscurite des temps"; that is, the origin of
   Masonry, like many others, loses itself in the obscurity of time. When I
   came to this expression, I supposed Lalande a Mason, and on inquiry found
   he was. This passing over saved him from the embarrassment which Masons
   are under respecting the disclosure of their origin, and which they are
   sworn to conceal.

   There is a society of Masons in Dublin who take the name of Druids; these
   Masons must be supposed to have a reason for taking that name.

   I come now to speak of the cause of secrecy used by the Masons.

   The natural source of secrecy is fear. When any new religion overruns a
   former religion, the professors of the new become the persecutors of the
   old. We see this in all instances that history brings before us.

   When Hilkiah the priest and Shaphan the scribe, in the reign of King
   Josiah, found, or pretended to find, the law, called the Law of Moses, a
   thousand years after the time of Moses (and it does not appear from II
   Kings, xxii, xxiii, that such a law was ever practised or known before the
   time of Josiah), he established that law as a national religion, and put
   all the priests of the sun to death.

   When the Christian religion over-ran the Jewish religion, the Jews were
   the continual subject of persecution in all Christian countries. When the
   Protestant religion in England over-ran the Roman Catholic religion, it
   was made death for a Catholic priest to be found in England.

   As this has been the case in all the instances we have any knowledge of,
   we are obliged to admit it with respect to the case in question, and that
   when the Christian religion over-ran the religion of the Druids in Italy,
   ancient Gaul, Britain and Ireland, the Druids became the subject of
   persecution.

   This would naturally and necessarily oblige such of them as remained
   attached to their original religion to meet in secret, and under the
   strongest injunctions of secrecy. Their safety depended upon it. A false
   brother might expose the lives of many of them to destruction; and from
   the remains of the religion of the Druids, thus preserved, arose the
   institution which, to avoid the name of Druid, took that of Mason, and
   practised under this new name the rites and ceremonies of Druids.
