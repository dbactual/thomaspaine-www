Title: The Recall of Monroe
Date: Mon Aug  4 09:08:53 EDT 2014

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Monroe was recalled from France on August 22, 1796 by President Washington
   who had been influenced by Gouverneur Morris, still in Europe, to believe
   that the American Minister to France had attacked the American chief
   executive and was organizing an anti-Washington conspiracy among
   Frenchmen. On his return to the United States, in 1797, Monroe sought in
   vain to discover the reason for his removal. Paine's letter, dated
   September 27, 1797, was addressed to the editors of the Bien-in forme.

   CITIZENS: In your nineteenth number of the complimentary fifth, you gave
   an analysis of the letters of James Monroe to Timothy Pickering. The
   newspapers of Paris and the departments have copied this correspondence
   between the Ambassador of the United States and the Secretary of State. I
   notice, however, that a few of them have omitted some important facts,
   while indulging in comments of such an extraordinary nature that it is
   clear they know neither Monroe's integrity nor the intrigues of Pitt in
   this affair. The recall of Monroe is connected with circumstances so
   important to the interests of France and the United States that we must be
   careful not to confound it with the recall of an ordinary individual. The
   Washington faction had affected to spread it abroad that James Monroe was
   the cause of rupture between the two Republics.

   This accusation is a perfidious and calumnious one; since the main point
   in this affair is not so much the recall of a worthy, enlightened and
   Republican Minister, as the ingratitude and clandestine maneuvering of the
   Government of Washington, who caused the misunderstanding by signing a
   treaty injurious to the French Republic.

   James Monroe, in his letters, does not deny the right of government to
   withdraw its confidence from any one of its delegates, representatives or
   agents. He has hinted, it is true, that caprice and temper are not in
   accordance with the spirit of paternal rule, and that whenever a
   representative government punishes or rewards good faith, integrity and
   justice should replace the good pleasure of kings.

   In the present case they have done more than recall an agent. Had they
   confined themselves to depriving him of his appointment, James Monroe
   would have kept silence; but he has been accused of lighting the torch of
   discord in both Republics. The refutation of this absurd and infamous
   reproach is the chief object of his correspondence. If he did not
   immediately complain of these slanders in his letters of the sixth and
   eighth [July], it is because he wished to use at first a certain degree of
   caution, and, if it were possible, to stifle intestine troubles at their
   birth. He wished to reopen the way to peaceful negotiations to be
   conducted with good faith and justice.

   The arguments of the Secretary of State on the rights of the supreme
   administration of the United States are peremptory; but the observations
   of Monroe on the hidden causes of his recall are touching; they come from
   the heart; they are characteristic of an excellent citizen.

   If he does more than complain of his unjust recall as a man of feeling
   would;  if he proudly asks for proofs of a grave accusation, it is after
   he has tried in vain every honest and straightforward means. He will not
   suffer that a government, sold to the enemies of freedom, should discharge
   upon him its shame, its crimes, its ingratitude, and all the odium of its
   unjust dealings.

   Were Monroe to find himself an object of public hatred, the Republican
   party in the United States, that party which is the sincere ally of
   France, would be annihilated, and this is the aim of the English
   Government.

   Imagine the triumph of Pitt, if Monroe and the other friends of freedom in
   America, should be unjustly attacked in France!

   Monroe does not lay his cause before the Senate since the Senate itself
   ratified the unconstitutional treaty; he appeals to the House of
   Representatives, and at the same time lays his cause before the upright
   tribunal of the American nation.
