   WORSHIP AND CHURCH BELLS, A LETTER TO CAMILLE JORDAN

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   This pamphlet, published in the summer of 1797 in Paris and London, was
   Paine's reply to a Report made to the French Convention by Camille Jordan,
   a royalist lawyer and member of the Council of Five Hundred, recommending
   the restoration of certain Catholic privileges, especially the church
   bells. The petition was rejected by the Convention.

   One sentence in particular stands out in the article: "It is a want of
   feeling to talk of priests and bells while so many infants are perishing
   in the hospitals, and aged and infirm poor in the streets, from the want
   of necessaries."

   ***

   CITIZEN REPRESENTATIVE: As everything in your Report, relating to what you
   call worship, connects itself with the books called the Scriptures, I
   begin with a quotation therefrom. It may serve to give us some idea of the
   fanciful origin and fabrication of those books, II Chronicles xxxiv, 14,
   etc. "Hilkiah, the priest, found the book of the law of the Lord given by
   Moses. And Hilkiah, the priest, said to Shaphan, the scribe, I have found
   the book of the law in the house of the Lord, and Hilkiah delivered the
   book to Shaphan. And Shaphan, the scribe, told the king (Josiah), saying,
   Hilkiah, the priest, hath given me a book."

   This pretended finding was about a thousand years after the time that
   Moses is said to have lived. Before this pretended finding there was no
   such thing practised or known in the world as that which is called the Law
   of Moses.

   This being the case, there is every apparent evidence that the books
   called the books of Moses (and which make the first part of what are
   called the Scriptures) are forgeries contrived between a priest and a limb
   of the law, Hilkiah, and Shaphan the scribe, a thousand years  after Moses
   is said to have been dead. (It happens that Camille Jordan is a limb of
   the law.-Author.)

   Thus much for the first part of the Bible. Every other part is marked with
   circumstances equally as suspicious. We ought therefore to be
   reverentially careful how we ascribe books as His Word, of which there is
   no evidence, and against which there is abundant evidence to the contrary,
   and every cause to suspect imposition.

   In your Report you speak continually of something by the name of worship,
   and you confine yourself to speak of one kind only, as if there were but
   one, and that one was unquestionably true.

   The modes of worship are as various as the sects are numerous; and amidst
   all this variety and multiplicity there is but one article of belief in
   which every religion in the world agrees. That article has universal
   sanction. It is the belief of a God, or what the Greeks described by the
   word Theism, and the Latins by that of Deism. 

   Upon this one article have been erected all the different superstructures
   of creeds and ceremonies continually warring with each other that now
   exist or ever existed. But the men most and best informed upon the subject
   of theology rest themselves upon this universal article, and hold all the
   various superstructures erected thereon to be at least doubtful, if not
   altogether artificial.

   The intellectual part of religion is a private affair between every man
   and his Maker, and in which no third party has any right to interfere. The
   practical part consists in our doing good to each other. But since
   religion has been made into a trade, the practical part has been made to
   consist of ceremonies performed by men called priests; and the people have
   been amused with ceremonial shows, processions and bells.

   By devices of this kind true religion has been banished; and such means
   have been found out to extract money even from the pockets of the poor,
   instead of contributing to their relief.

   No man ought to make a living by religion. It is dishonest so to do.
   Religion is not an act that can be performed by proxy. One person cannot
   act religion for another. Every person must perform it for himself; and
   all that a priest can do is to take from him; he wants nothing but his
   money and then to riot in the spoil and laugh at his credulity.

   The only people who, as a professional sect of Christians provide for the
   poor of their society, are people known by the name of Quakers. Those men
   have no priests. They assemble quietly in their places of meeting, and do
   not disturb their neighbors with shows and noise of bells. Religion does
   not unite itself to show and noise. True religion is without either. Where
   there is both there is no true religion.

   The first object for inquiry in all cases, more especially in matters of
   religious concern, is TRUTH. We ought to inquire into the truth of
   whatever we are taught to believe, and it is certain that the books called
   the Scriptures stand in this respect in more than a doubtful predicament.

   They have been held in existence, and in a sort of credit among the common
   class of people, by art, terror and persecution. They have little or no
   credit among the enlightened part, but they have been made the means of
   encumbering the world with a numerous priesthood, who have fattened on the
   labor of the people and consumed the sustenance that ought to be applied
   to the widows and the poor.

   It is a want of feeling to talk of priests and bells while so many infants
   are perishing in the hospitals, and aged and infirm poor in the streets,
   from the want of necessaries. The abundance that France produces is
   sufficient for every want, if rightly applied; but priests and bells, like
   articles of luxury, ought to be the least articles of consideration.

   We talk of religion. Let us talk of truth; for that which is not truth is
   not worthy of the name of religion.

   We see different parts of the world overspread with different books, each
   of which, though contradictory to the other, is said by its partisans to
   be of divine origin, and is made a rule of faith and practise.

   In countries under despotic governments, where inquiry is always
   forbidden, the people are condemned to believe as they have been taught by
   their priests. This was for many centuries the case in France: but this
   link in the chain of slavery is happily broken by the Revolution; and,
   that it may never be riveted again, let us employ a part of the liberty we
   enjoy in scrutinizing into the truth.

   Let us leave behind us some monument that we have made the cause and honor
   of our Creator an object of our care. If we have been imposed upon by the
   terrors of government and the artifice of priests in matters of religion,
   let us do justice to our Creator by examining into the case. His name is
   too sacred to be affixed to anything which is fabulous; and it is our duty
   to inquire whether we believe, or encourage the people to believe, in
   fables or in facts.

   It would be a project worthy the situation we are in to invite an inquiry
   of this kind. We have committees for various objects; and among others, a
   committee for bells. We have institutions, academies and societies for
   various purposes; but we have none for inquiring into the historical truth
   in matters of religious concern.

   They show us certain books which they call the Holy Scriptures, the Word
   of God, and other names of that kind; but we ought to know what evidence
   there is for our believing them to be so, and at what time they originated
   and in what manner. We know that men could make books, and we know that
   artifice and superstition could give them a name-could call them sacred.
   But we ought to be careful that the name of our Creator be not abused. Let
   then all the evidence with respect to those books be made a subject of
   inquiry. If there be evidence to warrant our belief in them, let us
   encourage the propagation of it; but if not, let us be careful not to
   promote the cause of delusion and falsehood.

   I have already spoken of the Quakers-that they have no priests, no
   bells-and that they are remarkable for their care of the poor of their
   Society. They are equally as remarkable for the education of their
   children. I am a descendant of a family of that profession; my father was
   a Quaker; and I presume I may be admitted an evidence of what I assert.

   The seeds of good principles, and the literary means of advancement in the
   world, are laid in early life. Instead, therefore, of consuming the
   substance of the nation upon priests, whose life at best is a life of
   idleness, let us think of providing for the education of those who have
   not the means of doing it themselves. One good schoolmaster is of more use
   than a hundred priests.

   If we look back at what was the condition of France under the ancien
   regime, we cannot acquit the priests of corrupting the morals of the
   nation. Their pretended celibacy led them to carry debauchery and domestic
   infidelity into every family where they could gain admission; and their
   blasphemous pretensions to forgive sins encouraged the commission of them.
   Why has the Revolution of France been stained with crimes, which the
   Revolution of the United States of America was not? Men are physically the
   same in all countries; it is education that makes them different. Accustom
   a people to believe that priests or any other class of men can forgive
   sins, and you will have sins in abundance.

   I come now to speak more particularly to the object of your report.

   You claim a privilege incompatible with the Constitution and with rights.
   The Constitution protects equally, as it ought to do, every profession of
   religion; it gives no exclusive privilege to any. The churches are the
   common property of all the people; they are national goods, and cannot be
   given exclusively to any one profession, because the right does not exist
   of giving to any one that which appertains to all.

   It would be consistent with right that the churches be sold, and the money
   arising therefrom be invested as a fund for the education of children of
   poor parents of every profession, and, if more than sufficient for this
   purpose, that the surplus be appropriated to the support of the aged poor.
   After this, every profession can erect its own place of worship, if it
   choose-support its own priests, if it choose to have any-or perform its
   worship without priests, as the Quakers do.

   As to bells, they are a public nuisance. If one profession is to have
   bells, and another has the right to use the instruments of the same kind,
   or any other noisy instrument, some may choose to meet at the sound of
   cannon, another at the beat of drum, another at the sound of trumpets, and
   so on, until the whole becomes a scene of general confusion. But if less
   nights and days they undergo, we shall feel the impropriety of increasing
   their distress by the noise of bells, or any other noisy instruments.

   Quiet and private domestic devotion neither offends nor incommodes
   anybody; and the Constitution has wisely guarded against the use of
   externals. Bells come under this description, and public processions still
   more so. Streets and highways are for the accommodation of persons
   following their several occupations, and no sectary has a right to
   incommode them. If anyone has, every other has the same; and the meeting
   of various and contradictory processions would be tumultuous.

   Those who formed the Constitution had wisely reflected upon these cases;
   and, while they were careful to preserve the equal right of everyone, they
   restrained everyone from giving offense, or incommoding another.

   Men who, through a long and tumultuous scene, have lived in retirement as
   you have done, may think, when they arrive at power, that nothing is more
   easy than to put the world to rights in an instant; they form to
   themselves gay ideas at the success of their projects; but they forget to
   contemplate the difficulties that attend them and the dangers with which
   they are pregnant.

   Alas! nothing is so easy as to deceive one's self. Did all men think as
   you think, or as you say, your plan would need no advocate, because it
   would have no opposer; but there are millions who think differently to
   you, and who are determined to be neither the dupes nor the slaves of
   error or design.

   It is your good fortune to arrive at power, when the sunshine of
   prosperity is breaking forth after a long and stormy night. The firmness
   of your colleagues, and of those you have succeeded-the unabated energy of
   the Directory, and the unequaled bravery of the armies of the
   Republic-have made the way smooth and easy to you.

   If you look back at the difficulties that existed when the Constitution
   commenced, you cannot but be confounded with admiration at the difference
   between that time and now. At that moment the Directory were placed like
   the forlorn hope of an army, but you were in safe retirement. They
   occupied the post of honorable danger, and they have merited well of their
   country.

   You talk of justice and benevolence, but you begin at the wrong end. The
   defenders of your country, and the deplorable state of the poor, are
   objects of prior consideration to priests and bells and gaudy processions.

   You talk of peace, but your manner of talking of it embarrasses the
   Directory in making it, and serves to prevent it. Had you been an actor in
   all the scenes of government from its commencement, you would have been
   too well informed to have brought forward projects that operate to
   encourage the enemy.

   When you arrived at a share in the government, you found everything
   tending to a prosperous issue. A series of victories unequaled in the
   world, and in the obtaining of which you had no share, preceded your
   arrival. Every enemy but one was subdued; and that one (the Hanoverian
   Government of England), deprived of every hope, and a bankrupt in all its
   resources, was suing for peace. In such a state of things, no new question
   that might tend to agitate and anarchize the interior ought to have had
   place; and the project you propose tends directly to that end.

   While France was a monarchy, and under the government of those things
   called kings and priests, England could always defeat her; but since
   France has RISEN TO BE A REPUBLIC, the GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND crouches
   beneath her, so great is the difference between a government of kings and
   priests, and that which is founded on the system of representation.

   But, could the Government of England find a way, under the sanction of
   your report, to inundate France with a flood of emigrant priests, she
   would find also the way to domineer as before; she would retrieve her
   shattered finances at your expense, and the ringing of bells would be the
   tocsin of your downfall.

   Did peace consist in nothing but the cessation of war, it would not be
   difficult; but the terms are yet to be arranged; and those terms will be
   better or worse, in proportion as France and her counsels be united or
   divided. That the Government of England counts much upon your Report, and
   upon others of a similar tendency, is what the writer of this letter, who
   knows that government well, has no doubt.

   You are but new on the theater of government, and you ought to suspect
   yourself of misjudging; the experience of those who have gone before you,
   should be of some service to you. But if, in consequence of such measures
   as you propose, you put it out of the power of the Directory to make a
   good peace, and force them to accept of terms you would afterwards
   reprobate, it is yourself that must bear the censure.

   You conclude your Report by the following address to your colleagues:

   Let us hasten, representatives of the people! to affix to these tutelary
   laws the seal of our unanimous approbation. All our fellow-citizens will
   learn to cherish political liberty from the enjoyment of religious
   liberty: you will have broken the most powerful arm of your enemies; you
   will have surrounded this assembly with the most impregnable
   rampart-confidence, and the people's love.

   O my colleagues, how desirable is that popularity which is the offspring
   of good laws! What a consolation it will be to us hereafter, when returned
   to our own firesides, to hear from the mouths of our fellow-citizens these
   simple expressions-Blessings reward you, men of peace! you have restored
   to us our temples, our ministers, the liberty of adoring the God of our
   fathers: you have recalled harmony to our families-morality to our hearts:
   you have made us adore the legislature and respect all its laws!

   Is it possible, citizen representative, that you can be serious in this
   address? Were the lives of the priests under the ancien regime such as to
   justify anything you say of them? Were not all France convinced of their
   immorality? Were they not considered as the patrons of debauchery and
   domestic infidelity, and not as the patrons of morals ? What was their
   pretended celibacy but perpetual adultery? What was their blasphemous
   pretension to forgive sins but an encouragement to the commission of them,
   and a love for their own?

   Do you want to lead again into France all the vices of which they have
   been the patrons, and to overspread the Republic with English pensioners?
   It is cheaper to corrupt than to conquer; and the English Government,
   unable to conquer, will stoop to corrupt. Arrogance and meanness, though
   in appearance opposite, are vices of the same heart.

   Instead of concluding in the manner you have done, you ought rather to
   have said:

   "O my colleagues! we are arrived at a glorious period-a period that
   promises more than we could have expected, and all that we could have
   wished. Let us hasten to take into consideration the honors and rewards
   due to our brave defenders. Let us hasten to give encouragement to
   agriculture and manufactures, that commerce may reinstate itself, and our
   people have employment. Let us review the condition of the suffering poor,
   and wipe from our country the reproach of forgetting them.

   "Let us devise means to establish schools of instruction, that we may
   banish the ignorance that the ancien regime of kings and priests had
   spread among the people. Let us propagate morality, unfettered by
   superstition. Let us cultivate justice and benevolence, that the God of
   our fathers may bless us. The helpless infant and the aged poor cry to us
   to remember them. Let not wretchedness be seen in our streets. Let France
   exhibit to the world the glorious example of expelling ignorance and
   misery together.

   "Let these, my virtuous colleagues, be the subject of our care that, when
   we return among our fellow-citizens they may say, Worthy representatives!
   you have done well. You have done justice and honor to our brave
   defenders. You have encouraged agriculture, cherished our decayed
   manufactures, given new life to commerce, and employment to our people.

   "You have removed from our country the reproach of forgetting the poor-
   You have caused the cry of the orphan to cease- You have wiped the tear
   from the eye of the suffering mother- You have given comfort to the aged
   and infirm- You have penetrated into the gloomy recesses of wretchedness,
   and have banished it.

   "Welcome among us, ye brave and virtuous representatives, and may your
   example be followed by your successors!"

   THOMAS PAINE.

   PARIS, 1797.
