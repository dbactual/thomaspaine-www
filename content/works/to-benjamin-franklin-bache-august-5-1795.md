   To Benjamin Franklin Bache  August 5, 1795

   PARIS,

   SIR:

   I have lately published a small tract entitled Dissertations upon first
   Principles of Government. As the press was set in English as well as in
   French I have struck off an additional quantity. You will receive a
   package containing 5000 about three hundred of which are French. Please to
   advertise them at not more than twenty cents and wholesale according what
   the custom is with you. If there are more than you have occasion for send
   some to Mr. Fellows of New York.

   The package was sent from the Printers to the care of Mr. Skipwith
   American Consul at Paris. Two other packages which belong to the printer,
   Mr. Stine, were sent at the same time, intended for Mr. John Vaughn,
   Philadelphia. I believe that the clerk at Mr. Skipwith's has put your
   address on all three. Should this be the case, please to rectify the
   mistake, and send the packages that do not contain the publications that
   are mine to Mr. Vaughn. I have enclosed you a letter in the Package. I do
   not yet learn what vessel they are shipped in, but the packages were sent
   to Havre. I hope to be in America before next spring.

   Your Friend, etc.,

   THOMAS PAINE.
