   To Citizen Le Brun  December 4, 1792

   MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

   Auteuil, Friday, the 4th December, 1792.

   I enclose an Irish newspaper which has been sent me from Belfast. It
   contains the Address of the Society of United Irishmen of Dublin (of which
   Society I am a member) to the volunteers of Ireland. None of the English
   newspapers that I have seen have ventured to republish this Address, and
   as there is no other copy of it than this which I send you, I request you
   not to let it go out of your possession. Before I received this newspaper
   I had drawn up a statement of the affairs of Ireland, which I had
   communicated to my friend General Ducatelet at Auteuil, where I now am. I
   wish to confer with you on that subject, but as I do not speak French, and
   as the matter requires confidence, General Duchatelet has desired me to
   say that if you can make it convenient to dine with him and me at Auteuil,
   he will with pleasure do the office of interpreter. I send this letter by
   my servant, but as it may not be convenient to you to give an answer
   directly, I have told him not to wait. THOMAS PAINE.
