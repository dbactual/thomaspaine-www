   To Benjamin Franklin  June 22, 1787

   PARIS,

   MY DEAR SIR:

   We left New York on the 26th of April, and arrived at Havre de Grace on
   the 26th of May. I set off in company with M. Germon, a French gentleman,
   passenger from America, for Paris. I stayed one day at Rouen to take a
   view of the place from whence the kings of England date their origin.
   There are yet some remains of the palaces of the dukes of Normandy; but
   the Parliament House has such a resemblance to Westminster Hall, I mean
   the great hall as you enter, that, had I not known I had been in Normandy,
   I might have supposed myself at London. The breadth of the room is nearly
   seventy feet, and the roof is constructed exactly in the manner of that at
   Westminster. The country from Havre to Rouen is the richest I ever saw.
   The crops are abundant, and the cultivation in nice and beautiful order.
   Everything appeared to be in fullness; the people are very stout, the
   women exceedingly fair, and the horses of a vast size and very fat. I saw
   several at Havre that were seventeen hands high. I deposited the model of
   the bridge at the custom-house, the superintendent of which undertook to
   send it to Paris as soon as an order should be procured for that purpose,
   as he did not think himself authorized to do it without, it being an
   imported article.

   I arrived at Paris on the 30th of May, and the next day began delivering
   the letters you were so kind as to honor me with. My reception here, in
   consequence of them, has been abundantly cordial and friendly. I have
   received visits and invitations from all who were in town. The Duke de
   Rochefoucauld and General Chastellux are in the country. I dined yesterday
   with an old friend of yours, M. Malesherbes, who is of the new Council of
   Finances, and who received me with a heartiness of friendship. It must
   have been a very strong attachment to America that drew you from this
   country, for your friends are very numerous and very affectionate.

   Mr. Le Roy has been most attentively kind to me. As he speaks English,
   there is scarcely a day passes without an interview. He took me a few days
   ago to see an old friend of yours, M. Buffon, but we were informed by the
   servant that he was very ill, and under the operation of medicine, on
   which we deferred our intention. In the evening he sent me an invitation
   to see an exhibition of fireworks of a new kind, made of inflammable air.
   It was done as an experiment. The exhibition was in a room. The performer
   had two large bladders of air, one under each arm, with pipes from them
   communicating with the figures to be represented, such as suns, moons,
   stars, flowers, architecture, and figures of moving machinery. By
   compressing the bladders and mixing the air, he produced the most
   beautiful and sudden transitions of light and colors, increased or
   diminished the motion, and exhibited the most pleasing scene of that kind
   that can be imagined.

   The model from Havre is not yet arrived, but a letter received from thence
   yesterday informs me that it is on the road, and will be here in about
   eight days. There is a great curiosity here to see it, as bridges have
   lately been a capital subject. A new bridge is begun over the Seine,
   opposite the Palais de Bourbon and the Place de Louis Quinze. It is about
   the breadth of the Schuylkill, and the Abbe Morley tells me, will cost
   five millions of livres. It is on piers.

   Your old friend, M. Terenet, the bridge architect, is yet living. I was
   introduced to him by M. Le Roy. He has taken a residence in the Elysian
   Fields for the purpose of being near the works. He has invited me to see
   his house at Paris, where all his drawings and models are. By the next
   packet I will write to you respecting the opinion of the Academy on the
   model. I shall be obliged to Mr. Clymer to send me some Philadelphia and
   American news. Please to present me with much respect to your family, and
   to all my good friends around you.

   I am, dear sir, your affectionate and obedient servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
