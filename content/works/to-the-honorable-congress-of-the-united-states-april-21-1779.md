   To the Honorable Congress of the United States  April 21, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   Congress having resolved to publish their Journals weekly, beginning with
   the first of January 1779, and as the proceedings respecting me form a
   considerable part of the first business in the Journals, and as the
   publication thereof is intended to give information to your constituents I
   have the request that the purport, at least, of my letters of January 6th,
   7th and 8th be inserted.

   The substance of the letter of the 6th is sufficiently contained in the
   first paragraph.

   The substance of that of the 7th, is, requesting as your servant and
   demanding as a citizen of the United States an attested copy of the
   complaint against me, that I might answer it, and informing this Honorable
   House that I had evidence that I presumed would justify me, and entreating
   them not to do an act which they could not justify by proceeding to
   judgment in the matter without hearing me.

   The substance of that of the 8th is, my resignation of the office of
   Secretary to the Committee for foreign affairs, because a motion for
   hearing me had been negatived; with my reasons for the part I had acted.

   Unless the purport, at least, of those letters be inserted I conceive that
   the Journals cannot be understood, and will require an explanation from me
   disagreeable to this Honorable House.

   But that which would prevent all future controversy would be to insert the
   whole of the letters, and it is my request that they may be inserted, and
   the more so, because they have been represented by some gentlemen of this
   Honorable House as forming a part of the complaint against me, and
   consequently those gentlemen can have no objection to their appearance;
   and I request that no member of this Honorable House, out of tenderness to
   me, will negative a motion for their being inserted at length; for as
   without them, the proceedings of Congress, by having frequent reference
   thereto, must appear obscure and partial.

   Congress will please to remember, they began their hard treatment of me
   while I was defending their injured and insulted honor, and which I cannot
   account for, on any other ground, than supposing, that a private
   unwarrantable connection was formed between Mr. Deane and certain members
   of this Honorable House.

   I am Honorable Sirs, your Honors Obedient, Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
