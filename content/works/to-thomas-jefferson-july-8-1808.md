   To Thomas Jefferson July 8, 1808

   DEAR SIR:

   On the 21st of January I presented a Memorial to Congress and after
   waiting a considerable time and hearing nothing of it, I wrote to George
   Clinton junior who presented the Memorial to Congress desiring some
   information of it. In his answers of March 19 he says, "I am desired by
   Mr. Holmes chairman of the Committee of Claims to inform you that the
   business of the Memorial is progressing and that as soon as they received
   certain information from the President and Vice President a report would
   be made." (1) No report however has been made, and I write this letter to
   request you to inform Mr. Holmes or the Committee of Claims have made any
   application to you on this subject.

   I now pass on from this disagreeable affair to what I like much
   better-Public Affairs. The British ministry have outschemed themselves. It
   is not difficult to see what the motive and object of that Ministry were
   in issuing the Orders of Council. They expected those orders would giving
   permission to such cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart
   for the Continent Europe to raise a revenue out of those countries and
   America. But instead of this they have lost the revenue they used to
   receive from American imports, and instead of gaining all the commerce
   they have lost it all.

   This being the case with the British Ministry it is natural to suppose
   they would be glad to tread back their steps, if they could do it without
   too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy. The Embargo law empowers
   the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be satisfied that
   our ships can pass in safety. It therefore includes the idea of empowering
   him to use means for arriving at that event. Suppose the President were to
   authorize Mr. Pinckney to propose to the British Ministry that the United
   States would negotiate with France for rescinding the Milan Decree, on
   condition the English Ministry would rescind their Orders of Council; and
   in that case the United States would recall their Embargo. France and
   England stand now at such a distance that neither can propose anything to
   the other, neither are there any neutral powers to act as mediators. The
   United States is the only power that can act.

   Perhaps the British Ministry if they listen to the proposal will want to
   add to it the Berlin decree, which excludes English commerce from the
   continent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it
   anything to do with the Embargo. The British Orders of Council and the
   Milan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.

   Yours in friendship,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   1. The Committee of Claims submitted its report on Paine's memorial on
   February 1, 1809. It rejected Paine's request for compensation on the
   grounds that his memorial had been "unaccompanied with any evidence in
   support of the statement of facts"; that the Journals of Congress revealed
   no evidence that Paine "was in any manner connected with the mission of
   Colonel Laurens," and that while Paine did accompany Colonel Laurens on
   his mission, it did "not appear that he was employed by the Government, or
   even solicited by any officer thereof to aid in the accomplishment of the
   mission with which Colonel Laurens was intrusted, or that he took any part
   whatever, after his arrival in France, in forwarding the negotiation." The
   Committee, however, added: "That Mr. Paine rendered great and eminent
   services to the United States, during their struggle for liberty and
   independence, cannot be doubted by any person acquainted with his labors
   in the cause, and attached to the principles of the contest. Whether he
   has been generously requited by his country for his meritorious exertions,
   is a question not submitted to your Committee, or within their province to
   decide." Annals of Congress, 10th Congress, Second Session, 1808-1809, pp.
