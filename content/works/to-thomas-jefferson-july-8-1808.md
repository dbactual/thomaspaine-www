   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.
   
   New York Partition Street No 63 July 8th, 1808.

   Dear Sir

   On the 21st Jany I presented a Memorial to Congress and after
   waiting a considerable time and hearing nothing of it, I wrote to George
   Clinton Junior who presented the Memorial to Congress desiring some
   information of it. In his answers of March 19 he says, "I am desired by
   Mr. Holmes Chairman of the Committee of Claims to inform you That the
   business of the Memorial is progressing and that as soon as they received
   certain information from the President and Vice President a report would
   be made."&mdash; No report however has been made, and I write this letter to
   request you to inform Mr. Holmes or the Committee of Claims have made any
   application to you on this subject.

   I now pass on from this disagreeable affair to what I like much
   better - Public Affairs. The british Ministry have outschemed themselves. It
   is not difficult to see what the motive and object of that Ministry were
   in issuing the orders of Council. They expected those orders would force all
   the Commerce of the United States to England and then by giving permission to such 
   Cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart
   for the Continent of Europe, to raise a revenue out of those Countries and
   America. But instead of this they have lost revenue, that is they lost the revenue 
   they used to receive from American imports, and instead of gaining all the commerce
   they have lost it all.

   This being the case with the british Ministry it is natural to suppose
   they would be glad to tread back their steps if they could do it without
   too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy. The Embargo law empowers
   the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be satisfied that
   our ships can pass in safety. It therefore includes the Idea of empowering
   him to use means for arriving at that event. Suppose the President were to
   authorize Mr. Pinckney to propose to the british Ministry that the United
   States would negociate with France for rescinding the Milan Decree, on
   Condition the english Ministry would rescind their orders of Council and
   in that case the United States would recall their Embargo. France and
   England stand now at such a distance that neither can propose any thing to
   the other, neither are there any neutral powers to act as mediator. The
   U. S. is the only power that can act.

   Perhaps the british Ministry, if they listen to the proposal will want to
   add to it the Berlin decree which excludes english Commerce from the
   Continent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it
   any thing to do with the Embargo. The british orders of Council and the
   Milan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.

   Yours in friendship

   Thomas Paine
