   FROM THE CASTLE IN THE AIR TO THE LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD*

    

    

   THE God that Moses writes about

   Is one that I refuse,

   He for his chosen People took

   The disobedient Jews.

    

   Their country often he laid waste,

   Their little ones he slew;

    But I have shown a better taste

   In chusing Y, O, U.

    

   Then be you gay, or be you grave,

   Or wheresoe'er you be,

    Mind this command, that "Thou shalt have

   No other Gods than me."

    

   All Idols thou shalt put away

   Thine Eye no Evil see,

   And if thou'lt love the Lord thy God

   Thy Lord God will love thee.
