   From the original letter at the Library of Congress.

   Sepr. 15th &mdash;
   
   This letter was intended to go by the last dispatches of Mr, Bartholemey 
   but was late &mdash; I have since seen a New-York paper of the 8th of August 
   in which there is a circular letter from the Convention of New-York signed 
   by the President (Governor Clinton) to the several Legislatures which 
   states, that altho' they had acceded to the federal Constitution, from 
   principles of regard to the Union, it was, in the opinion of the majority of 
   them, exceptionable in many points, and recommending that another Convention 
   be hereafter assembled &mdash; agreeable to the precision made in the Bens 
   Whetson, for the purpose of reforming altering &c &mdash; nothing 
   particular, as to defect, is provided at in the Circular letter, the 
   aspersions are general, and they disclaim all local Ideas.
   
   A motion was made in Congress that the new Congress meet at Baltimore 
   which was carried 7 States 6 6 &mdash; the question was reconsidered 
   the next day &mdash; and carried 7 6 6 for New York, in this State it 
   stood when she Expel Yates.
   
   It was said sometime ago in the English News papers, that five officers 
   of the Swedish Army had withdrawn and refused to serve, because the King had 
   undertaken an *offensive* War, without consulting and having the concurrence 
   of the Senate, agreeabke to an Article in this term of government; but 
   a gentleman who is intimate of Baron Nolkins the Swedish Minister tells 
   me that a *third* of the officers have made that objection, which has 
   disabled the progress of the Swedish Army in Finland.
   
   Whether I shall set off a Catenarian Arch or an Arch of a Circle I have 
   not yet determined, but I mean to set off both and take my choice &mdash; 
   There is one objection against a Catenarian Arch, which is that the Iron 
   tubes being all cast in one form will not usually fit every part of it.
   
   An Arch of a Circle may be sett off to any extent by calculating the 
   Ordinates, at equal distances on the diameter. In this case, the Radius 
   will always be the Hypotenuse. The portion of the diameter be the Base, and 
   the Ordinate the perpendicular or the Ordinate may be found by Trigonometry 
   in which the Base, Hypotenuse & right angle will be always given &mdash; 
   
   I think the Arch will appear rather handsome if the direction of the Blocks 
   and Walls were always in the direction of the Radius as I first proposed 
   but which I changed in the drawing and placed as perpendicular to the 
   Cord instead of the Curve to remedy the inconvenience of the diverging of 
   the Bolts as you mentioned &mdash; 
   
   In a very large Arch of 5 or 600 feet Cord, this diverging will 
   be considerable about 3 or 4 tenths of an inch on every two feet &mdash; 
   but this difficulty may be effectually remedied, and the direction of 
   the radius preserved by making the Bar in line halves, with half a hole 
   in each; they will then be put on sideways and may be united by clamps. 
   This method will exceedingly facilitate the raising or pulling the Arch 
   together, shorten the time of the Work on the River very considerably. I 
   am not fond of hazarding opinions, neither is it proper or prudent to do it, 
   but I think that after every thing is prepared, a Bridge over such a River 
   as the Seine, might be put in three months time or less, as all the Arches 
   would be began on at once, and the work would admit of as many hands being 
   emplyed at the same time as you please.

   I have not heard any thing of Mr. Littlepage since I left Paris &mdash; 
   if you have, I shall be glad to know it &mdash; As he dined sometimes 
   at Mr. Neckar's, he undertook to describe the Bridge to him &mdash; Mr. 
   Neckar very readily conceived it &mdash; if you have an opportunity of 
   seeing Mr. Neckar, and see it
   convenient to renew the subject you might mention that I am going forward
   with an experiment Arch &mdash; 
   
   Mr. Le Couteulx desired me to examine the
   construction of the Albion Steam Mills erected by Bolton and Watts &mdash; 
   I have not yet written to him because I had nothing to write about &mdash; 
   I have talked
   with Mr. Rumsey who is here, upon this matter, and who appears to me to
   be master of that subject and who has procured a model of the Mill, which
   is worked originally from the Steam, but it will be necessary to know what 
   proposals Mr. Le Coaleulx will make to any person who will undertake to 
   construct his spare Steam Engines, of which he has one always in each 
   Building, into a Mill, and conduct the operation &mdash; in this case Mr. 
   Rumsey appears to me the very person Mr. Le Coaleulx wants &mdash; the 
   enclosed letter to Mr. Le Coaleulx is on thsi subject.
   
   There has been some proposals passed on each side between Dalton and Rumsey 
   in which I thank the former has taken advantage of the unsuspicious openess 
   of the latter.
   
   I have again enquired about the map, and find it is engraving at the place 
   you mentioned &mdash; It will be 8 feet by 6 and the price about 2 guineas, 
   but they cannot tell me the time it will be finished &mdash; I informed you 
   of the Air pumb in my letter to you by Mr. Quesney &mdash;  When you see 
   Mr. Le Roy please to present my compliments &mdash; I hope I shall now 
   realize the opinion of the Academy on the Model &mdash; in which case I shall
   give the Academy the proper information &mdash; 
   
   We have no certain accounts here
   of the arrangement of the new Ministry &mdash; the papers mention Count St.
   Priest for foreign Affairs &mdash; when you see him please to present my
   Compliments. 
   
   The New York Packet is arrived this morning she sailed the eighth of Augt 
   and brings nothing new &mdash; The majority on the Convention of N. York 
   was but three &mdash; 
   
   The question for the meeting of Congress at Philadelphia was put and lost 
   &mdash; 
   
   Please to present my compliment to M. and Madame de Corney.
