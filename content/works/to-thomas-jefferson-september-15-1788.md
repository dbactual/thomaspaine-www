   To Thomas Jefferson September 15, 1788

   LONDON,

   DEAR SIR :

   I have not heard of Mr. [Lewis] Littlepage since I left Paris, if you
   have, I shall be glad to know it. As he dined sometimes at Mr. Neckar's,
   he undertook to describe the Bridge to him. Mr. Neckar very readily
   conceived it. If you have an opportunity of seeing Mr. Neckar, and see it
   convenient to renew the subject, you might mention that I am going forward
   with an experiment arch. Mr. Le Couteulx desired me to examine the
   construction of the Albion Steam Mills erected by Bolton and Watt. I have
   not yet written to him because I had nothing to write about. I have talked
   with Mr. Rumsey, who is here, upon this matter, and who appears to me to
   be master of that subject, and who has procured a model of the Mill, which
   is worked originally from the steam [illegible].

    When you see Mr. Le Roy please to present my compliments. I hope to
   realize the opinion of the Academy on the Model, in which case I shall
   give the Academy the proper information. We have no certain accounts here
   of the arrangement of the new Ministry. The papers mention Count St.
   Priest for Foreign Affairs. When you see him please to present my
   compliments [illegible]. Please to present my compliments to M. and Madame
   de Corney.
