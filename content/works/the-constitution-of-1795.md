   SPEECH IN THE FRENCH NATIONAL CONVENTION, JULY 7, 1795

   Philip Foner's introduction:

   On the 19th of Messidor of the year III, Paine had read from the tribune
   in the French National Convention the translation of this speech, which he
   had written in English, pointing sharply to the contradictions between the
   principles of 1789 and the property requirements for suffrage in the
   proposed Constitution of 1795. The Convention, dominated by the wealthy
   bourgeoisie who were determined to keep political power in their own
   hands, listened impatiently to Paine's fervent call for universal
   suffrage. No one arose to speak in support of Paine, and the Convention
   went on to adopt the conservative Constitution on September 23, 1795.

   Paine never appeared again in the Convention after the reading of the
   speech.

   ON the motion of Lanthenas, "That permission be granted to Thomas Paine,
   to deliver his sentiments on the Declaration of Rights and the
   Constitution," Thomas Paine ascended the tribune; and no opposition being
   made to the motion, one of the secretaries, who stood by Mr. Paine, read
   his speech, of which the following is a literal translation:

   CITIZENS :

   The effects of a malignant fever with which I was afflicted during a
   rigorous confinement in the Luxembourg, have thus long prevented me from
   attending at my post in the bosom of the Convention, and the magnitude of
   the subject under discussion, and no other consideration on earth, could
   induce me now to repair to my station.

   A recurrence to the vicissitudes I have experienced, and the critical
   situations in which I have been placed in consequence of the French
   Revolution, will throw upon what I now propose to submit to the Convention
   the most unequivocal proofs of my integrity, and the rectitude of those
   principles which have uniformly influenced my conduct.

   In England I was proscribed for having vindicated the French Revolution,
   and I have suffered a rigorous imprisonment in France for having pursued a
   similar mode of conduct. During the reign of terrorism, I was a close
   prisoner for eight long months, and remained so above three months after
   the era of the tenth Thermidor. I ought, however, to state, that I was not
   persecuted by the people either of England or France. The proceedings in
   both countries were the effects of the despotism existing in their
   respective governments. But, even if my persecution had originated in the
   people at large, my principles and conduct would still have remained the
   same. Principles which are influenced and subject to the control of
   tyranny have not their foundation in the heart.

   A few days ago I transmitted to you by the ordinary mode of distribution a
   short treatise entitled "Dissertation on the First Principles of
   Government." This little work I did intend to have dedicated to the people
   of Holland, who, about the time I began to write it, were determined to
   accomplish a revolution in their government, rather than to the people of
   France, who had long before effected that glorious object. But there are,
   in the Constitution which is about to be ratified by the Convention,
   certain articles, and in the report which preceded it certain points so
   repugnant to reason and incompatible with the true principles of liberty
   as to render this treatise, drawn up for another purpose, applicable to
   the present occasion, and under this impression I presumed to submit it to
   your consideration.

   If there be faults in the Constitution, it were better to expunge them now
   than to abide the event of their mischievous tendency; for certain it is
   that the plan of the Constitution which has been presented to you is not
   consistent with the grand object of the Revolution, nor congenial to the
   sentiments of the individuals who accomplished it.

   To deprive half the people in a nation of their rights as citizens is an
   easy matter in theory or on paper; but it is a most dangerous experiment,
   and rarely practicable in the execution.

   I shall now proceed to the observations I have to offer on this important
   subject; and I pledge myself that they shall be neither numerous nor
   diffusive.

   In my apprehension, a constitution embraces two distinct parts or objects,
   the Principle and the Practise; and it is not only an essential but an
   indispensable provision that the practise should emanate from, and accord
   with, the principle. Now I maintain, that the reverse of this proposition
   is the case in the plan of the Constitution under discussion. The first
   article, for instance, of the political state of citizens (v. Title ii. of
   the Constitution), says:

   "Every man born and resident in France, who, being twenty-one years of
   age, has inscribed his name on the civic register of his canton, and who
   has lived afterwards one year on the territory of the Republic, and who
   pays any direct contribution whatever, real or personal, is a French
   citizen."

   I might here ask, if those only who come under the above description are
   to be considered as citizens, what designation do you mean to give the
   rest of the people ? I allude to that portion of the people on whom the
   principal part of the labor falls, and on whom the weight of indirect
   taxation will in the event chiefly press. In the structure of the social
   fabric this class of people are infinitely superior to that privileged
   order whose only qualification is their wealth or territorial possessions.
   For what is trade without merchants? What is land without cultivation? And
   what is the produce of the land without manufactures? But to return to the
   subject.

   In the first place, this article is incompatible with the three first
   articles of the Declaration of Rights which precede the Constitutional
   Act.

   The first article of the Declaration of Rights says:

   "The end of society is the public good; and the institution of government
   is to secure to every individual the enjoyment of his rights."

   But the article of the Constitution to which I have just adverted proposes
   as the object of society, not the public good, or in other words, the good
   of all, but a partial good; or the good only of a few; and the
   Constitution provides solely for the rights of this few, to the exclusion
   of the many.

   The second article of the Declaration of Rights says:

   "The rights of man in society are liberty, equality, security of his
   person and property."

   But the article alluded to in the Constitution has a direct tendency to
   establish the reverse of this position, inasmuch as the persons excluded
   by this inequality can neither be said to possess liberty, nor security
   against oppression. They are consigned totally to the caprice and tyranny
   of the rest.

   The third article of the Declaration of Rights says:

   "Liberty consists in such acts of volition as are not injurious to
   others."

   But the article of the Constitution, on which I have observed, breaks down
   this barrier. It enables the liberty of one part of society to destroy the
   freedom of the other.

   Having thus pointed out the inconsistency of this article to the
   Declaration of Rights, I shall proceed to comment on that of the same
   article which makes a direct contribution a necessary qualification to the
   right of citizenship.

   A modern refinement on the object of public revenue has divided the taxes,
   or contributions, into two classes, the direct and the indirect, without
   being able to define precisely the distinction or difference between them,
   because the effect of both is the same.

   Those are designated indirect taxes which fall upon the consumers of
   certain articles on which the tax is imposed because, the tax being
   included in the price, the consumer pays it without taking notice of it.

   The same observation is applicable to the territorial tax. The land
   proprietors, in order to reimburse themselves, will rack-rent their
   tenants: the farmer, of course, will transfer the obligation to the miller
   by enhancing the price of grain; the miller to the baker by increasing the
   price of flour; and the baker to the consumer by raising the price of
   bread. The territorial tax, therefore, though called direct, is, in its
   consequences, indirect.

   To this tax the land proprietor contributes only in proportion to the
   quantity of bread and other provisions that are consumed in his own
   family. The deficit is furnished by the great mass of the community, which
   comprehends every individual of the nation.

   From the logical distinction between the direct and indirect taxation some
   emolument may result, I allow, to auditors of public accounts, etc., but
   to the people at large I deny that such a distinction (which by the by is
   without a difference) can be productive of any practical benefit. It ought
   not, therefore, to be admitted as a principle in the Constitution.

   Besides this objection the provision in question does not affect to
   define, secure, or establish the right of citizenship. It consigns to the
   caprice or discretion of the legislature the power of pronouncing who
   shall, or shall not, exercise the functions of a citizen; and this may be
   done effectually, either by the imposition of a direct or indirect tax,
   according to the selfish views of the legislators, or by the mode of
   collecting the taxes so imposed.

   Neither a tenant who occupies an extensive farm, nor a merchant or
   manufacturer who may have embarked a large capital in their respective
   pursuits, can ever, according to this system, attain the preemption of a
   citizen.

   On the other hand, any upstart, who has, by succession or management, got
   possession of a few acres of land or a miserable tenement, may exultingly
   exercise the functions of a citizen, although perhaps neither possesses a
   hundredth part of the worth or property of a simple mechanic, nor
   contributes in any proportion to the exigencies of the state.

   The contempt in which the old Government held mercantile pursuits, and the
   obloquy that attached on merchants and manufacturers, contributed not a
   little to its embarrassments and its eventual subversion; and, strange to
   tell, though the mischiefs arising from this mode of conduct are so
   obvious, yet an article is proposed for your adoption which has a manifest
   tendency to restore a defect inherent in the monarchy.

   I shall now proceed to the second article of the same title, with which I
   shall conclude my remarks.

   The second article says, "Every French soldier, who shall have served one
   or more campaigns in the cause of liberty, is deemed a citizen of the
   Republic, without any respect or reference to other qualifications."

   It would seem that in this article the Committee were desirous of
   extricating themselves from a dilemma into which they had been plunged by
   the preceding article. When men depart from an established principle they
   are compelled to resort to trick and subterfuge, always shifting their
   means to preserve the unity of their objects; and as it rarely happens
   that the first expedient makes amends for the prostitution of principle
   they must call in aid a second, of a more flagrant nature, to supply the
   deficiency of the former.

   In this manner legislators go on accumulating error upon error, and
   artifice upon artifice, until the mass becomes so bulky and incongruous,
   and their embarrassment so desperate, that they are compelled, as their
   last expedient, to resort to the very principle they had violated. The
   Committee were precisely in this predicament when they framed this
   article; and to me, I confess, their conduct appears specious rather than
   efficacious.

   It was not for himself alone, but for his family, that the French citizen,
   at the dawn of the Revolution (for then indeed every man was considered a
   citizen), marched soldier-like to the frontiers, and repelled a foreign
   invasion. He had it not in his contemplation, that he should enjoy liberty
   for the residue of his earthly career, and by his own act preclude his
   offspring from that inestimable blessing. No! He wished to leave it as an
   inheritance to his children, and that they might hand it down to their
   latest posterity.

   If a Frenchman, who united in his person the character of a soldier and a
   citizen, was now to return from the army to his peaceful habitation, he
   must address his small family in this manner: "Sorry I am, that I cannot
   leave to you a small portion of what I have acquired by exposing my person
   to the ferocity of our enemies and defeating their machinations. I have
   established the Republic, and, painful the reflection, all the laurels
   which I have won in the field are blasted, and all the privileges to which
   my exertions have entitled me extend not beyond the period of my own
   existence!" Thus the measure that has been adopted by way of subterfuge
   falls short of what the framers of it speculated upon; for in conciliating
   the affections of the soldier, they have subjected the father to the most
   pungent sensations, by obliging him to adopt a generation of slaves.

   Citizens, a great deal has been urged respecting insurrections. I am
   confident that no man has a greater abhorrence of them than myself, and I
   am sorry that any insinuations should have been thrown out upon me as a
   promoter of violence of any kind. The whole tenor of my life and
   conversation gives the lie to those calumnies, and proves me to be a
   friend to order, truth and justice.

   I hope you will attribute this effusion of my sentiments to my anxiety for
   the honor and success of the Revolution. I have no interest distinct from
   that which has a tendency to meliorate the situation of mankind. The
   Revolution, as far as it respects myself, has been productive of more loss
   and persecution than it is possible for me to describe or for you to
   indemnify. But with respect to the subject under consideration, I could
   not refrain from declaring my sentiments.

   In my opinion, if you subvert the basis of the Revolution, if you dispense
   with principles, and substitute expedients, you will extinguish that
   enthusiasm and energy which have hitherto been the life and soul of the
   Revolution; and you will substitute in its place nothing but a cold in-
   difference and self-interest, which will again degenerate into intrigue,
   cunning and effeminacy.

   But to discard all considerations of a personal and subordinate nature, it
   is essential to the well-being of the Republic that the practical or
   organic part of the Constitution should correspond with its principles;
   and as this does not appear to be the case in the plan that has been
   presented to you, it is absolutely necessary that it should be submitted
   to the revision of a committee, who should be instructed to compare it
   with the Declaration of Rights in order to ascertain the difference
   between the two, and to make such alterations as shall render them
   perfectly consistent and compatible with each other.
