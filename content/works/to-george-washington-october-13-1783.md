   To George Washington  October 13, 1783

   BORDENTOWN,

   SIR:

   I returned to this place last Saturday from Philadelphia, but not in a
   condition of health fit to wait on you at Rocky hill. I was taken with a
   severe attack of the fever last Wednesday while at Col. Biddle's,
   accompanied, as is usual in the complaint, with extreme pains in the back.
   But as the fever has been but of short duration with those who caught it
   late in the season, I am in hopes that a few days will terminate mine, as
   I feel less of it this morning, than at any time since I was first taken,
   and I shall be very happy when I find myself well enough to wait on you.

   I am, your Excellency's Obliged and obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
