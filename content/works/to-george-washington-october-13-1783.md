   From the original letter at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

   Sir
   
   Borden Town Oct. 13th 1783

   I returned to this place last Saturday from Philadelphia, but not in a
   condition of health fit to wait on you at Rocky hill. &mdash; I was taken with a
   severe attack of the fever last Wednesday while at Col. Biddle's,
   accompanied, as is usual in the complaint, with extreme pains in the back.
   &mdash; But as the fever has been but of short duration with those who caught it
   late in the season, I am in hopes that a few days will terminate mine, as
   I feel less of it this morning, than at any time since I was first taken,
   and I shall be very happy when I find myself well enough to wait on you.

   I am, your Excellency's Obliged and obt Humble Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
