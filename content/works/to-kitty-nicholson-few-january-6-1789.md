   To Kitty Nicholson Few  January 6, 1789

   LONDON,

   I sincerely thank you for your very friendly and welcome letter. I was in
   the country when it arrived and did not receive it soon enough to answer
   it by the return of the vessel.

   I very affectionately congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Few on their happy
   marriage, and every branch of the families allied by that connection; and
   I request my fair correspondent to present me to her partner, and to say,
   for me, that he has obtained one of the highest prizes on the wheel.
   Besides the pleasure which your letter gives me to hear you are all happy
   and well, it relieves me from a sensation not easy to be dismissed; and if
   you will excuse a few dull thoughts for obtruding themselves into a
   congratulatory letter I will tell you what it is. When I see my female
   friends drop off by matrimony I am sensible of something that affects me
   like a loss in spite of all the appearances of joy: I cannot help mixing
   the sincere compliment of regret with that of congratulation. It appears
   as if I had outlived or lost a friend. It seems to me as if the original
   was no more, and that which she is changed to forsakes the circle and
   forgets the scenes of former society. Felicities are cares superior to
   those she formerly cared for, create to her a new landscape of life that
   excludes the little friendships of the past. It is not every lady's mind
   that is sufficiently capacious to prevent those greater objects crowding
   out the less, or that can spare a thought to former friendships after she
   has given her hand and heart to the man who loves her. But the sentiment
   your letter contains has prevented these dull ideas from mixing with the
   congratulation I present you, and is so congenial with the enlarged
   opinion I have always formed of you, that at the time. I read your letter
   with pleasure I read it with pride, because it convinces me that I have
   some judgment in that most difficult science-a lady's mind. Most sincerely
   do I wish you all the good that heaven can bless you with, and as you have
   in your own family an example of domestic happiness you are already in the
   knowledge of obtaining it. That no condition we can enjoy is an exemption
   from care-that some shade will mingle itself with the brightest sunshine
   of life-that even our affections may become the instruments of our
   sorrows-that the sweet felicities of home depend on good temper as well as
   on good sense, and that there is always something to forgive even in the
   nearest and dearest of our friends,-are truths which, though too obvious
   to be told, ought never to be forgotten; and I know you will not esteem my
   friendship the less for impressing them upon you.

   Though I appear a sort of wanderer, the married state has not a sincerer
   friend than I am. It is the harbor of human life, and is, with respect to
   the things of this world, what the next world is to this. It is home; and
   that one word conveys more than any other word can express. For a few
   years we may glide along the tide of youthful single life and be
   wonderfully delighted; but it is a tide that flows but once, and what is
   still worse, it ebbs faster than it flows, and leaves many a hapless
   voyager aground. I am one, you see, that have experienced the fate I am
   describing. I have lost my tide; it passed by while every thought of my
   heart was on the wing for the salvation of my dear America, and I have
   now, as contentedly as I can, made myself a little bower of willows on the
   shore that has the solitary resemblance of a home. Should I always
   continue the tenant of this home, I hope my female acquaintance will ever
   remember that it contains not the churlish enemy of their sex, not the
   inaccessible cold hearted mortal, nor the capricious tempered oddity, but
   one of the best and most affectionate of their friends.

   I did not forget the Dunstable hat, but it was not on wear here when I
   arrived. That I am a negligent correspondent I freely confess, and I
   always reproach myself for it. You mention only one letter, but I wrote
   twice; once by Dr. Derby, and another time by the.Chevalier St. Triss- by
   whom I also wrote to Gen. Morris, Col. Kirkbride, and several friends in
   Philadelphia, but have received no answers. I had one letter from Gen.
   Morris last winter, which is all I have received from New York till the
   arrival of yours.

   I thank you for the details of news you give. Kiss Molly Field for me and
   wish her joy,-and all the good girls of Bordentown. How is my favorite
   Sally Morris, my boy Joe, and my horse Button? pray let me know. Polly and
   Nancy Rogers,-are they married? or do they intend to build bowers as I
   have done ? If they do, I wish they would twist their green willows
   somewhere near to mine.

   I am very much engaged here about my bridge- There is one building of my
   construction at Messrs. Walker's Iron Works in Yorkshire, and I have
   direction of it. I am lately come from thence and shall return again in
   two or three weeks.

   As to news on this side the water, the King is mad, and there is great
   bustle about appointing a Regent. As it happens, I am in pretty close
   intimacy with the heads of the opposition-the Duke of Portland, Mr. Fox
   and Mr. Burke. I have sent your letter to Mrs. Burke as a specimen of the
   accomplishments of the American ladies. I sent it to Miss Alexander, a
   lady you have heard me speak of, and I asked her to give me a few of her
   thoughts how to answer it. She told me to write as I felt, and I have
   followed her advice.

   I very kindly thank you for your friendly invitation to Georgia and if I
   am ever within a thousand miles of you, I will come and see you; though it
   be but for a day.

   You touch me on a very tender part when you say my friends on your side
   the water "cannot be reconciled to the idea of my resigning my adopted
   America, even for my native England." They are right. Though I am in as
   elegant style of acquaintance here as any American that ever came over, my
   heart and myself are 3000 miles apart; and I had rather see my horse
   Button in his own stable, or eating the grass of Bordentown or Morrisania,
   than see all the pomp and show of Europe.

   A thousand years hence (for I must indulge in a few thoughts), per- haps
   in less, America maybe what England now is! The innocence of her character
   that won the hearts of all nations in her favor may sound like a romance,
   and her inimitable virtue as if it had never been. The ruins of that
   liberty which thousands bled for, or suffered to obtain, may just furnish
   materials for a village tale or extort a sigh from rustic sensibility,
   while the fashionable of that day, enveloped in dissipation, shall deride
   the principle and deny the fact.

   When we contemplate the fall of empires and the extinction of nations of
   the ancient world, we see but little to excite our regret than the
   mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty
   pyramids, and walls and towers of the most costly workmanship. But when
   the empire of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow
   will be infinitely greater than crumbling brass or marble can inspire. It
   will not then be said, here stood a temple of vast antiquity,-here rose a
   Babel of invisible height, or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance;
   but here, ah painful thought! the noblest work of human wisdom, the
   grandest scene of human glory, the fair cause of freedom rose and fell!

   Read this and then ask if I forget America- But I'll not be dull if I can
   help it, so I leave off, and close my letter to-morrow, which is the day
   the mail is made up for America.

   January 7th. I have heard this morning with extreme concern of the death
   of our worthy friend Capt. Reed. Mrs. Reed lives in a house of mine at
   Bordentown, and you will much oblige me by telling her how much I am
   affected by her loss; and to mention to her, with that delicacy which such
   an offer and her situation require, and which no one knows better how to
   convey than yourself, that the two years' rent which is due I request her
   to accept of, and to consider herself at home till she hears further from
   me.

   This is the severest winter I ever knew in England; the frost has
   continued upwards of five weeks, and is still likely to continue. All the
   vessels from America have been kept off by contrary winds. The Polly and
   the Pigeon from Philadelphia and the Eagle from Charleston are just got
   in.

   If you should leave New York before I arrive (which I hope will not be the
   case) and should pass through Philadelphia, I wish you would do me the
   favor to present my compliments to Mrs. Powell, the lady whom I wanted an
   opportunity. to introduce you to when you were in Philadelphia, but was
   prevented by your being at a house where I did not visit.

   There is a Quaker favorite of mine at New York, formerly Miss Watson of
   Philadelphia; she is now married to Dr. Lawrence, and is an acquaintance
   of Mrs. Oswald: be so kind as to make her a visit for me. You will like
   her conversation. She has a little of the Quaker primness-but of the
   pleasing kind-about her.

   I am always distressed at closing a letter, because it seems like taking
   leave of my friends after a parting conversation.-Captain Nicholson, Mrs.
   Nicholson, Hannah, Fanny, James, and the little ones, and you my dear
   Kitty, and your partner for life-God bless you all! and send me safe back
   to my much loved America!

   THOMAS PAINE- aet. 52.

   or if you better like it

   Common Sense.

   This comes by the packet which sails from Falmouth, 300 miles from London;
   but by the first vessel from London to New York I will send you some
   magazines. In the meantime be so kind as to write to me by the first
   opportunity. Remember me to the family at Morrisania, and all my friends
   at New York and Bordentown. Desire Gen. Morris to take another guinea of
   Mr. Constable, who has some money of mine in his hands, and give it to my
   boy Joe. Tell Sally to take care of Button. Then direct for me at Mr.
   Peter Whiteside's London. When you are at Charleston remember me to my
   dear old friend Mrs. Lawrence, Col. and Mrs.

   L. Morris, and Col. Washington; and at. Georgia, to Col. Walton. Adieu.
