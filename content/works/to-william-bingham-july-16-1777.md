   To William Bingham  July 16, 1777.

   PHILADELPHIA,

   SIR:

   A very sudden opportunity offers of sending you the newspapers, from which
   you will collect the situation of our Affairs. The enemy finding their
   attempt of marching through the Jersies to this city impracticable, have
   retreated to Staten Island seemingly discontented and dispirited and quite
   at a loss what step next to pursue. Our army is now well recruited and
   formidable. Our militia in the several States ready at a day's notice to
   turn out and support the army when occasion requires; and though we
   cannot, in the course of a campaign, expect everything in the several
   parts of the continent to go just as we wish it; yet the general face of
   our affairs assures us of final success.

   In the papers of June 18th and 25 and July 2d you will find General
   Washington and Arnold's letters of the enemy's movement in, and retreat
   from the Jersies. We are under some apprehensions for Ticonderoga, as we
   find the enemy are unexpectedly come into that quarter. The Congress have
   several times had it in contemplation to remove the garrison from that
   place, as by experience we find that men shut up in forts are not of so
   much use as in the field, especially in the highlands, where every hill is
   a natural fortification.

   I am Sir, Your Obedient Humble Servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.
