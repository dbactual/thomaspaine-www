   LETTER TO GEORGE WASHINGTON



   Philip Foner's introduction:

   The background which led to the sending of this celebrated Letter to
   Washington must constantly be kept in mind in reading the document. For
   ten months, from December 28, 1793, until November 4, 1794, Paine remained
   in the Luxembourg prison, living in daily fear of being executed. To every
   appeal for his release he received the reply that he was considered an
   Englishman, not an American citizen, by the French officials, and that the
   government of the United States refused to regard him as citizen and
   authorize his release. Unaware of the role Gouverneur Morris was playing
   in conspiring to keep him in prison and at the same time leading the
   government of the United States to believe that he had done everything
   possible to help him, Paine grew more and more bitter toward Washington
   and interpreted the American President's silence as the most brutal type
   of ingratitude. He had ample time, moreover, to recall his past services
   to Washington, and especially remembered that in the fifth Crisis he had
   leaped to the defense of the commander-in-chief of the Continental army
   when he was attacked by enemies in Congress and was in danger of losing
   his command. The more he brooded on the subject, the more Paine was
   determined to expose Washington. James Monroe urged Paine not to write the
   letters, and dissuaded him from sending the one dated February 22, 1795.
   But on July 30, 1796, Paine sent the document to America.

   The publication of the Letter to Washington aroused a storm in America.
   The Federalists seized upon it as one further proof of the determination
   of the French revolutionists to overthrow American institutions by using
   Paine to undermine popular respect for the "father of the country."
   Furthermore, the fact that the Letter had been written at the home of
   James Monroe, a leading Jeffersonian, was proof positive, they cried, that
   the radical forces in America were involved in this gigantic conspiracy.
   Finally, all who were intent upon destroying the popular influence exerted
   by Paine's Age of Reason pointed to the Letter as an illustration of
   Paine's warped mind.

   The extremes to which the Federalists went in denouncing Paine roused
   popular support for the man who had rendered America great services during
   her darkest hours and whose writings were widely read in this country.
   Moreover, many people felt that Paine was justified in charging Washington
   with ingratitude, and excused the bitterness of his language by pointing
   to his physical suffering while in prison and his precarious state of
   health. In Joel Barlow's notebook in the Harvard University Library is a
   quatrain entitled "Thomas Paine's direction to the Sculptor who should
   make the statue of Washington," which reads:

   "Take from the mine the coldest, hardest stone

   It needs no fashion, it is Washington;

   But if you chisel, let your strokes be rude

   And on his breast engrave Ingratitude!"

   LETTER TO GEORGE WASHINGTON

   DATED PARIS, JULY 30,

   AS censure is but awkwardly softened by apology, I shall offer to you no
   apology for this letter. The eventful crisis to which your double politics
   have conducted the affairs of your country, requires an investigation
   uncramped by ceremony.

   There was a time when the fame of America, moral and political, stood fair
   and high in the world. The lustre of her Revolution extended itself to
   every individual; and to be a citizen of America gave a title to respect
   in Europe. Neither meanness nor ingratitude had been mingled in the
   composition of her character. Her resistance to the attempted tyranny of
   England left her unsuspected of the one, and her open acknowledgment of
   the aid she received from France precluded all suspicion of the other. The
   Washington of politics had not then appeared.

   At the time I left America (April, 1787) the Continental Convention, that
   formed the Federal Constitution was on the point of meeting. Since that
   time new schemes of politics, and new distinctions of parties, have
   arisen. The term Anti-federalist has been applied to all those who
   combated the defects of that Constitution, or opposed the measures of your
   administration.

   It was only to the absolute necessity of establishing some Federal
   authority, extending equally over all the States, that an instrument so
   inconsistent as the present Federal Constitution is, obtained a suffrage.
   I would have voted for it myself, had I been in America, or even for a
   worse, rather than have had none, provided it contained the means of
   remedying its defects by the same appeal to the people by which it was to
   be established. It is always better policy to leave removable errors to
   expose themselves than to hazard too much in contending against them
   theoretically.

   I have introduced these observations, not only to mark the general
   difference between Anti-federalist and Anti-constitutionalist, but to
   preclude the effect, and even the application, of the former of these
   terms to myself.

   I declare myself opposed to several matters in the Constitution,
   particularly to the manner in which what is called the Executive is
   formed, and to the long duration of the Senate; and if I live to return to
   America, I will use all my endeavors to have them altered. (I have always
   been opposed to the mode of refining government up to an individual, or
   what is called a single executive. Such a man will always be the' chief of
   a party. A plurality is far better: It combines the mass of a nation
   better together: And besides this, it is necessary to the manly mind of a
   republic that it loses the debasing idea of obeying an
   individual.-Author.) I also declare myself opposed to almost the whole of
   your administration; for I know it to have been deceitful, if not
   perfidious, as I shall show in the course of this letter.

   But as to the point of consolidating the States into a Federal Government,
   it so happens, that the proposition for that purpose came originally from
   myself. I proposed it in a letter to Chancellor Livingston in the spring
   of 1782, while that gentleman was Minister for Foreign Affairs. The five
   per cent, duty recommended by Congress had then fallen through, having
   been adopted by some of the States, altered by others, rejected by Rhode
   Island, and repealed by Virginia after it had been consented to.

   The proposal in the letter I allude to, was to get over the whole
   difficulty at once, by annexing a Continental legislative body to
   Congress; for in order to have any law of the Union uniform, the case
   could only be that either Congress, as it then stood, must frame the law,
   and the States severally adopt it without alteration, or the States must
   erect a Continental legislature for the purpose.

   Chancellor Livingston, Robert Morris, Gouverneur Morris and myself had a
   meeting at the house of Robert Morris on the subject of that letter. There
   was no diversity of opinion on the proposition for a Continental
   legislature: the only difficulty was on the manner of bringing the
   proposition forward. For my own part, as I considered it as a remedy in
   reserve, that could be applied at any time when the states saw themselves
   wrong enough to be put right (which did not appear to be the case at that
   time), I did not see the propriety of urging it precipitately, and
   declined being the publisher of it myself.

   After this account of a fact, the leaders of your party will scarcely have
   the hardiness to apply to me the term of Anti-federalist. But I can go to
   a date and to a fact beyond this; for the proposition for electing a
   Continental convention to form the Continental Government is one of the
   subjects treated of in the pamphlet "Common Sense."

   Having thus cleared away a little of the rubbish that might otherwise have
   lain in my way, I return to the point of time at which the present Federal
   Constitution and your administration began.

   It was very well said by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a year
   before that period, that "thirteen staves and ne'er a hoop will not make a
   barrel!' and as any kind of hooping the barrel, however defectively
   executed, would be better than none, it was scarcely possible but that
   considerable advantages must arise from the Federal hooping of the States.
   It was with pleasure that every sincere friend of America beheld, as the
   natural effect of union, her rising prosperity; and it was with grief they
   saw that prosperity mixed, even in the blossom, with the germ of
   corruption.

   Monopolies of every kind marked your administration almost in the moment
   of its commencement. The lands obtained by the Revolution were lavished
   upon partisans; the interest of the disbanded soldier was sold to the
   speculator; injustice was acted under the pretense of faith; and the chief
   of the army became the patron of the fraud. From such a beginning what
   else could be expected than what has happened? A mean and servile
   submission to the insults of one nation; treachery and ingratitude to
   another.

   Some vices make their approach with such a splendid appearance that we
   scarcely know to what class of moral distinctions they belong. They are
   rather virtues corrupted than vices, originally. But meanness and
   ingratitude have nothing equivocal in their character. There is not a
   trait in them that renders them doubtful. They are so originally vice that
   they are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into existence
   with the filth upon their back. The fugitives have found protection in
   you, and the levee-room is their place of rendezvous.

   As the Federal Constitution is a copy, though not quite so base as the
   original, of the form of the British Government, an imitation of its vices
   was naturally to be expected. So intimate is the connection between form
   and practise, that to adopt the one is to invite the other. Imitation is
   naturally progressive and is rapidly so in matters that are vicious.

   Soon after the Federal Constitution arrived in England, I received a
   letter from a female literary correspondent (a native of New York), very
   well mixed with friendship, sentiment and politics. In my answer to that
   letter, I permitted myself to ramble into the wilderness of imagination,
   and to anticipate what might hereafter be the condition of America. I had
   no idea that the picture I then drew was realizing so fast, and still less
   that Mr. Washington was hurrying it on. As the extract I allude to is
   congenial with the subject I am upon, I here transcribe it:

   You touch me on a very tender point when you say that my friends on your
   side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of my abandoning America.
   They are right. I had rather see my horse Button eating the grass of
   Bordentown or Morrisania than see all the pomp and show of Europe.

   A thousand years hence (for I must indulge a few thoughts), perhaps in
   less, America may be what Europe now is. The innocence of her character,
   that won the hearts of all nations in her favor, may sound like a romance
   and her inimitable virtue as if it had never been. The ruin of that
   liberty which thousands bled for or struggled to obtain may just furnish
   materials for a village tale or extort a sigh from rustic sensibility,
   whilst the fashionable of that day, enveloped in dissipation, shall deride
   the principle and deny the fact.

   When we contemplate the fall of empires and the extinction of the nations
   of the Ancient World, we see but little to excite our regret than the
   mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent museums, lofty pyramids
   and walls and towers of the most costly workmanship; but when the empire
   of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow will be
   infinitely greater than crumbling brass and marble can inspire. It will
   not then be said, here stood a temple of vast antiquity; here rose a babel
   of invisible height; or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance; but
   here, Ah, painful thought! the noblest work of human wisdom, the grandest
   scene of human glory, the fair cause of Freedom rose and fell. Read this,
   and then ask if I forget America.

   Impressed, as I was, with apprehensions of this kind, I had America
   constantly in my mind in all the publications I afterwards made. The first
   and still more the second part of the "Rights of Man" bear evident marks
   of this watchfulness; and the "Dissertation on First Principles of
   Government" goes more directly to the point than either of the former. I
   now pass on to other subjects.

   It will be supposed by those into whose hands this letter may fall that I
   have some personal resentment against you; I will therefore settle this
   point before I proceed further.

   If I have any resentment you must acknowledge that I have not been hasty
   in declaring it; neither would it now be declared (for what are private
   resentments to the public) if the cause of it did not unite itself as well
   with your public as with your private character, and with the motives of
   your political conduct.

   The part I acted in the American Revolution is well known; I shall not
   here repeat it. I know also that had it not been for the aid received from
   France, in men, money and ships, that your cold and unmilitary conduct (as
   I shall show in the course of this letter) would in all probability have
   lost America; at least she would not have been the independent nation she
   now is. You slept away your time in the field, till the finances of the
   country were completely exhausted, and you have but little share in the
   glory of the final event. It is time, Sir, to speak the undisguised
   language of historical truth.

   Elevated to the chair of the Presidency, you assumed the merit of
   everything to yourself, and the natural ingratitude of your constitution
   began to appear. You commenced your Presidential career by encouraging and
   swallowing the grossest adulation, and you traveled America from one end
   to the other to put yourself in the way of receiving it. You have as many
   addresses in your chest as James II. As to what were your views, for, if
   you are not great enough to have ambition, you are little enough to have
   vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from expressions of your own; but
   the partisans of your politics have divulged the secret.

   John Adams has said (and John it is known was always a speller after
   places and offices, and never thought his little services were highly
   enough paid) John has said, that as Mr. Washington had no child, the
   Presidency should be made hereditary in the family of Lund Washington.
   John might then have counted upon some sinecure himself, and a provision
   for his descendants. He did not go so far as to say, also, that the
   Vice-Presidency should be hereditary in the family of John Adams. He
   prudently left that to stand on the ground that one good turn deserves
   another. (Two persons to whom John Adams said this, told me of it. The
   secretary of Mr. Jay was present when it was told to me.-Author.)

   John Adams is one of those men who never contemplated the origin of
   government, or comprehended anything of first principles. If he had, he
   might have seen that the right to set up and establish hereditary
   government never did, and never can, exist in any generation at any time
   whatever; that it is of the nature of treason; because it is an attempt to
   take away the rights of all the minors living at that time, and of all
   succeeding generations. It is of a degree beyond common treason. It is a
   sin against nature. The equal right of every generation is a right fixed
   in the nature of things. It belongs to the son when of age, as it belonged
   to the father before him.

   John Adams would himself deny the right that any former deceased
   generation could have to decree authoritatively a succession of governors
   over him, or over his children; and yet he assumes the pretended right,
   treasonable as it is, of acting it himself. His ignorance is his best
   excuse.

   John Jay has said (and this John was always the sycophant of everything in
   power, from Mr. Gerard in America, to Grenville in England), -John Jay has
   said that the Senate should have been appointed for life.He would then
   have been sure of never wanting a lucrative appointment for himself, and
   have had no fears about impeachment. These are the disguised traitors that
   call themselves Federalists. (If Mr. John Jay desires to know on what
   authority I say this, I will give that authority publicly when he chooses
   to call for it.-Author.)

   Could I have known to what degree of corruption and perfidy the
   administrative part of the Government of America had descended, I could
   have been at no loss to have understood the reservedness of Mr. Washington
   toward me, during my imprisonment in the Luxembourg. There are cases in
   which silence is a loud language. I will here explain the cause of that
   imprisonment, and return to Mr. Washington afterwards.

   In the course of that rage, terror and suspicion which the brutal letter
   of the Duke of Brunswick first started into existence in France, it
   happened that almost every man who was opposed to violence, or who was not
   violent himself, became suspected. I had constantly been opposed to
   everything which was of the nature or of the appearance of violence; but
   as I had always done it in a manner that showed it to be a principle
   founded in my heart, and not a political maneuver, it precluded the
   pretense of accusing me. I was reached, however, under another pretense.

   A decree was passed to imprison all persons born in England; but as I was
   a member of the convention, and had been complimented with the honorary
   style of Citizen of France, as Mr. Washington and some other Americans had
   been, this decree fell short of reaching me. A motion was afterwards made
   and carried, supported chiefly by Bourdon de Toise, for expelling
   foreigners from the Convention. My expulsion being thus effected, the two
   committees of Public Safety and of General Surety, of which Robespierre
   was the dictator, put me in arrestation under the former decree for
   imprisoning persons born in England. Having thus shown under what pretense
   the imprisonment was effected, I come to speak of such parts of the case
   as apply between me and Mr. Washington, either as a President or as an
   individual.

   I have always considered that a foreigner, such as I was in fact, with
   respect to France, might be a member of a convention for framing a
   constitution, without affecting his right of citizenship in the country to
   which he belongs, but not a member of a government after a constitution is
   formed; and I have uniformly acted upon this distinction. To be a member
   of a government requires that a person be in allegiance to that government
   and to the country locally. But a constitution, being a thing of
   principle, and not of action, and which, after it is formed, is to be
   referred to the people for their approbation or rejection, does not
   require allegiance in the persons forming and proposing it; and besides
   this, it is only to the thing after it be formed and established, and to
   the country after its governmental character is fixed by the adoption of a
   constitution, that the allegiance can be given.

   No oath of allegiance or of citizenship was required of the members who
   composed the Convention: there was nothing existing in form to swear
   allegiance to. If any such condition had been required, I could not, as
   citizen of America in fact, though citizen of France by compliment, have
   accepted a seat in the Convention.

   As my citizenship in America was not altered or diminished by anything I
   had done in Europe (on the contrary, it ought to be considered as
   strengthened, for it was the American principle of government that I was
   endeavoring to spread in Europe), and as it is the duty of every
   government to charge itself with the care of any of its citizens who may
   happen to fall under an arbitrary persecution abroad, and is also one of
   the reasons for which ambassadors or ministers are appointed-it was the
   duty of the Executive Department in America, to have made (at least) some
   inquiries about me, as soon as it heard of my imprisonment.

   But if this had not been the case, that government owed it to me on every
   ground and principle of honor and gratitude. Mr. Washington owed it to me
   on every score of private acquaintance, I will not now say, friendship;
   for it has some time been known by those who know him, that he has no
   friendships; that he is incapable of forming any; he can serve or desert a
   man, or a cause, with constitutional indifference; and it is this cold,
   hermaphrodite faculty that imposed itself upon the world and was credited
   for a while, by enemies as by friends, for prudence, moderation and
   impartiality.

   Soon after I was put into arrestation and imprisonment in the Luxembourg,
   the Americans who were then in Paris went in a body to the bar of the
   Convention to reclaim me. They were answered by the then President Vadier,
   who has since absconded, that / was born in England, and it was signified
   to them by some of the Committee of General Surety to whom they were
   referred (I have been told it was Billaud Varennes) that their reclamation
   of me was only the act of individuals, without any authority from the
   American Government.

   A few days after this, all communication from persons imprisoned to any
   person without the prison was cut off by an order of the police. I neither
   saw, nor heard from, anybody for six months; and the only hope that
   remained to me was that a new Minister would arrive from America to
   supersede Morris, and that he would be authorized to inquire into the
   cause of my imprisonment. But even this hope, in the state to which
   matters were daily arriving, was too remote to have any consolatory
   effect, and I contented myself with the thought that I might be remembered
   when it would be too late.

   There is perhaps no condition from which a man conscious of his own
   uprightness cannot derive consolation; for it is in itself a consolation
   for him to find that he can bear that condition with calmness and
   fortitude.

   From about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Robespierre July
   twenty-ninth (9th of Thermidor), the state of things in the prisons was a
   continued scene of horror. No man could count upon life for twenty-four
   hours. To such a pitch of rage and suspicion were Robespierre and his
   committee arrived, that it seemed as if they feared to leave a man living.
   Scarcely a night passed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
   were not taken out of the prison, carried before a pretended tribunal in
   the morning and guillotined before night.

   One hundred and sixty-nine were taken out of the Luxembourg one night, in
   the month of July, and one hundred and sixty of them guillotined. A list
   of two hundred more, according to the report in the prison, was preparing
   a few days before Robespierre fell. In this last list I have good reason
   to believe I was included. A memorandum in the hand-writing of Robespierre
   was afterwards produced in the Convention, by the committee to whom the
   papers of Robespierre were referred, in these words:

   Demander que Thomas Payne soit Demand that Thomas Paine be dedecrete
   d'accusation pour les inte- creed of accusation for the interests rets de
   l'Amerique, autant que de of America as well as of France, la France.

   I had then been imprisoned seven months, and the silence of the Executive
   part of the Government of America (Mr. Washington) upon the case, and upon
   everything respecting me, was explanation enough to Robespierre that he
   might proceed to extremities.

   A violent fever which had nearly terminated my existence, was, I believe,
   the circumstance that preserved it. I was not in a condition to be
   removed, or to know of what was passing, or of what had passed, for more
   than a month. It makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The first thing
   I was informed of was the fall of Robespierre.

   About a week after this, Mr. Monroe arrived to supersede Gouverneur
   Morris, and as soon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be
   read, I found a way to convey one to him by means of the man who lighted
   the lamps in the prison; and whose unabated friendship to me, from whom he
   had never received any service, and with difficulty accepted any
   recompense, puts the character of Mr. Washington to shame.

   In a few days I received a message from Mr. Monroe, conveyed to me in a
   note from an intermediate person, with assurance of his friendship, and
   expressing a desire that I would rest the case in his hands. After a
   fortnight or more had passed, and hearing nothing further, I wrote to a
   friend who was then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, requesting him to
   inform me what was the true situation of things with respect to me. I was
   sure that something was the matter; I began to have hard thoughts of Mr.
   Washington, but I was unwilling to encourage them.

   In about ten days I received an answer to my letter, in which the writer
   says, "Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no order [meaning from the
   President, Mr. Washington] respecting you, but that he (Mr. Monroe) will
   do everything in his power to liberate you; but, from what I learn from
   the Americans lately arrived in Paris, you are not considered, either by
   the American Government, or by the individuals, as an American citizen."

   I was now at no loss to understand Mr. Washington and his new fangled
   faction, and that their policy was silently to leave me to fall in France.
   They were rushing as fast as they could venture, without awakening the
   jealousy of America, into all the vices and corruptions of the British
   Government; and it was no more consistent with the policy of Mr.
   Washington, and those who immediately surrounded him, than it was with
   that of Robespierre or of Pitt, that I should survive. They have, however,
   missed the mark, and the reaction is upon themselves.

   Upon the receipt of the letter just alluded to, I sent a memorial to Mr.
   Monroe, which the reader will find in the appendix , and I received from
   him the following answer. It is dated the eighteenth of September, but did
   not come to hand till about the fourth of October. I was then falling into
   a relapse, the weather was becoming damp and cold, fuel was not to be had,
   and the abscess in my side (the consequence of these things and of the
   want of air and exercise), was beginning to form, and which has continued
   immovable ever since.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here follows Mr. Monroe's letter:

   PARIS, September 18, 1794.

   DEAR SIR:

   I was favored soon after my arrival here with several letters from you,
   and more latterly with one in the character of a Memorial upon the subject
   of your confinement; and should have answered them at the times they were
   respectively written had I not concluded you would have calculated with
   certainty upon the deep interest I take in your welfare, and the pleasure
   with which I shall embrace every opportunity in my power to serve you. I
   should still pursue the same course, and for reasons which must obviously
   occur, if I did not find that you are disquieted with apprehensions upon
   interesting points, and which justice to you and our country equally
   forbid you should entertain.

   You mention that you have been informed you are not considered as an
   American citizen by the Americans, and that you have likewise heard that I
   had no instructions respecting you by the Government. I doubt not the
   person who gave you the information meant well, but I suspect he did not
   even convey accurately his own ideas on the first point: for I presume the
   most he could say is that you had likewise become a French citizen, and
   which by no means deprived you of being an American one.

   Even this, however, may be doubted, I mean the acquisition of citizenship
   in France, and I confess you have said much to show that it has not been
   made. I really suspect that this was all that the gentleman who wrote to
   you, and those Americans he heard speak upon the subject meant. It becomes
   my duty, however, to declare to you, that I consider you as an American
   citizen, and that you are considered universally in that character by the
   people of America. As such you are entitled to my attention; and so far as
   it can be given consistently with those obligations which are mutual
   between every government and even a transient passenger, you shall receive
   it.

   The Congress have never decided upon the subject of citizenship in a
   manner to regard the present case. By being with us through the Revolution
   you are of our country as absolutely as if you had been born there, and
   you are no more of England than every native American is. This is the true
   doctrine in the present case, so far as it becomes complicated with any
   other consideration. I have mentioned it to make you easy upon the only
   point which could give you any disquietude.

   Is it necessary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I speak
   of the great mass of people, are interested in your welfare? They have not
   forgotten the history of their own Revolution and the difficult scenes
   through which they passed; nor do they review its several stages without
   reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the merits of those who
   served them in that great and arduous conflict. The crime of ingratitude
   has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain, our national character.
   You are considered by them as not only having rendered important service
   in our own Revolution, but as being, on a more extensive scale, the friend
   of human rights, and a distinguished and able advocate in favor of public
   liberty. To the welfare of Thomas Paine, the Americans are not, nor can
   they be, indifferent.

   Of the sense which the President has always entertained of your merits,
   and of his friendly disposition toward you, you are too well assured to
   require any declaration of it from me. That I forward his wishes in
   seeking your safety is what I well know, and this will form an additional
   obligation on me to perform what I should otherwise consider as a duty.

   You are, in my opinion, at present menaced by no kind of danger. To
   liberate you, will be an object of my endeavors, and as soon as possible.
   But you must, until that event shall be accomplished, bear your situation
   with patience and fortitude. You will likewise have the justice to
   recollect, that I am placed here upon a difficult theater, (This I presume
   alludes to the embarrassments which the strange conduct of Gouverneur
   Morris had occasioned, and which, I well know, had created suspicions of
   the sincerity of Mr. Washington.-Author.) many important objects to attend
   to, with few to consult. It becomes me in pursuit of those to regulate my
   conduct in respect to each, as to the manner and the time, as will, in my
   judgment, be best calculated to accomplish the whole.

   With great esteem and respect consider me personally your friend,

   JAMES MONROE.

   The part in Mr. Monroe's letter, in which he speaks of the President (Mr.
   Washington), is put in soft language. Mr. Monroe knew what Mr. Washington
   had said formerly, and he was willing to keep that in view. But the fact
   is, not only that Mr. Washington had given no orders to Mr. Monroe, as the
   letter [of Whiteside] stated, but he did not so much as say to him,
   inquire if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in prison or out, or see if there
   be any assistance we can give him.

   While these matters were passing, the liberations from the prisons were
   numerous; from twenty to forty in the course of almost every twenty-four
   hours. The continuance of my imprisonment after a new Minister had arrived
   immediately from America, which was now more than two months, was a matter
   so obviously strange, that I found the character of the American
   Government spoken of in very unqualified terms of reproach; not only by
   those who still remained in prison, but by those who were liberated, and
   by persons who had access to the prison from without. Under these
   circumstances I wrote again to Mr. Monroe, and found occasion, among other
   things, to say: "It will not add to the popularity of Mr. Washington to
   have it believed in America, as it is believed here, that he connives at
   my imprisonment."

   The case, so far as it respected Mr. Monroe, was, that having to get over
   the difficulties, which the strange conduct of Gouverneur Morris had
   thrown in the way of a successor, and having no authority from the
   American Government to speak officially upon anything relating to me, he
   found himself obliged to proceed by unofficial means with individual
   members; for though Robespierre was overthrown, the Robespierrian members
   of the Committee of Public Safety still remained in considerable force,
   and had they found out that Mr. Monroe had no official authority upon the
   case, they would have paid little or no regard to his reclamation of me.
   In the meantime my health was suffering exceedingly, the dreary prospect
   of winter was coming on, and imprisonment was still a thing of danger.

   After the Robespierrian members of the Committee were removed by the
   expiration of their time of serving, Mr. Monroe reclaimed me, and I was
   liberated the fourth of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris the
   beginning of August before. All that period of my imprisonment, at least,
   I owe not to Robespierre, but to his colleague in projects, George
   Washington.

   Immediately upon my liberation, Mr. Monroe invited me to his house, where
   I remained more than a year and a half; and I speak of his aid and
   friendship, as an open-hearted man will always do in such a case, with
   respect and gratitude.

   Soon after my liberation, the Convention passed an unanimous vote to
   invite me to return to my seat among them. The times were still unsettled
   and dangerous, as well from without as within, for the coalition was
   unbroken, and the Constitution not settled. I chose, however, to accept
   the invitation; for as I undertake nothing but what I believe to be right,
   I abandon nothing that I undertake; and I was willing also to show that,
   as I was not of a cast of mind to be deterred by prospects or retrospects
   of danger, so neither were my principles to be weakened by misfortune or
   perverted by disgust.

   Being now once more abroad in the world, I began to find that I was not
   the only one who had conceived an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Washington;
   it was evident that his character was on the decline as well among
   Americans as among foreigners of different nations. From being the chief
   of the government, he had made himself the chief of a party; and his
   integrity was questioned, for his politics had a doubtful appearance. The
   mission of Mr. Jay to London, notwithstanding there was an American
   Minister there already, had then taken place, and was beginning to be
   talked of. It appeared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped in
   mystery, which every day served either to increase or to explain into
   matter of suspicion.

   In the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Washington, as President, had
   sent Gouverneur Morris to London, as his secret agent to have some
   communication with the British Ministry. To cover the agency of Morris it
   was given out, I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from Robert
   Morris to borrow money in Europe, and the report was permitted to pass
   uncontradicted. The event of Morris's negotiation was, that Mr. Hammond
   was sent Minister from England to America, Pinckney from America to
   England, and himself Minister to France.

   If, while Morris was Minister in France, he was not an emissary of the
   British Ministry and the coalesced powers, he gave strong reasons to
   suspect him of it. No one who saw his conduct, and heard his conversation,
   could doubt his being in their interest; and had he not got off the time
   he did, after his recall, he would have been in arrestation. Some letters
   of his had fallen into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, and
   inquiry was making after him.

   A great bustle had been made by Mr. Washington about the conduct of Genet
   in America, while that of his own Minister, Morris, in France, was
   infinitely more reproachable. If Genet was imprudent or rash, he was not
   treacherous; but Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French
   Revolution, in every stage of it. But notwithstanding this conduct on the
   part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his character, Mr. Washington
   in a letter he wrote to him at the time of recalling him on the complaint
   and request of the Committee of Public Safety, assures him, that though he
   had complied with that request, he still retained the same esteem and
   friendship for him as before.

   This letter Morris was foolish enough to tell of; and, as his own
   character and conduct were notorious, the telling of it could have but one
   effect, which was that of implicating the character of the writer. Morris
   still loiters in Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr. Washington is still
   in correspondence with him. Mr. Washington ought, therefore, to expect,
   especially since his conduct in the affairs of Jay's Treaty, that France
   must consider Morris and Washington as men of the same description. The
   chief difference, however, between the two is (for in politics there is
   none), that the one is profligate enough to profess an indifference about
   moral principles, and the other is prudent enough to conceal the want of
   them.

   About three months after I was at liberty, the official note of Jay to
   Grenville on the subject of the capture of American vessels by the British
   cruisers appeared in the American papers that arrived at Paris. Everything
   was of a-piece. Everything was mean. The same kind of character went to
   all circumstances public or private. Disgusted at this national
   degradation, as well as at the particular conduct of Mr. Washington to me,
   I wrote to him (Mr. Washington) on the twenty-second of February (1795)
   under cover to the then Secretary of State (Mr. Randolph), and entrusted
   the letter to Mr. Letombe, who was appointed French Consul to
   Philadelphia, and was on the point of taking his departure. When I
   supposed Mr. Letombe had sailed, I mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe, and
   as I was then in his house, I showed it to him. He expressed a wish that I
   would recall it, which he supposed might be done, as he had learned that
   Mr. Letombe had not then sailed. I agreed to do so, and it was returned by
   Mr. Letombe under cover to Mr. Monroe.

   The letter, however, will now reach Mr. Washington publicly in the course
   of this work.

   About the month of September following, I had a severe relapse which gave
   occasion to the report of my death. I had felt it coming on a considerable
   time before, which occasioned me to hasten the work I had then in hand,
   the second part of the "Age of Reason." When I had finished that work, I
   bestowed another letter on Mr. Washington, which I sent under cover to

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Mr. Benjamin Franklin Bache of Philadelphia. The letter is as follows:

   PARIS, September 20, 1795.

   SIR:

   I had written you a letter by Mr. Letombe, French Consul, but, at the
   request of Mr. Monroe, I withdrew it, and the letter is still by me. I was
   the more easily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my intention to
   have returned to America the latter end of the present year, 1795; but the
   illness I now suffer prevents me. In case I had come, I should have
   applied to you for such parts of your official letters (and of your
   private ones, if you had chosen to give them) as contained any
   instructions or directions either to Mr. Monroe, or to Mr. Morris, or to
   any other person respecting me; for after you were informed of my
   imprisonment in France, it was incumbent on you to have made some inquiry
   into the cause, as you might very well conclude that I had not the
   opportunity of informing you of it.

   I cannot understand your silence upon this subject upon any other ground,
   than as connivance at my imprisonment; and this is the manner it is
   understood here, and will be understood in America, unless you give me
   authority for contradicting it. I therefore write you this letter, to
   propose to you to send me copies of any letters you have written that may
   remove that suspicion.

   In the preface to the second part of the "Age of Reason," I have given a
   memorandum from the handwriting of Robespierre, in which he proposed a
   decree of accusation against me, "for the interests of America as well as
   of France." He could have no cause for putting America in the case, but by
   interpreting the silence of the American Government into connivance and
   consent.

   I was imprisoned on the ground of being born in England; and your silence
   in not inquiring into the cause of that imprisonment, and reclaiming me
   against it, was tacitly giving me up. I ought not to have suspected you of
   treachery; but whether I recover from the illness I now suffer or not, I
   shall continue to think you treacherous, till you give me cause to think
   otherwise. I am sure you would have found yourself more at your ease had
   you acted by me as you ought; for whether your desertion of me was
   intended to gratify the English Government, or to let me fall into
   destruction in France that you might exclaim the louder against the French
   Revolution, or whether you hoped by my extinction to meet with less
   opposition in mounting up the American Government-either of these will
   involve you in reproach you will not easily shake off.

   THOMAS PAINE.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Here follows the letter above alluded to, which I had stopped in
   complaisance to Mr. Monroe:

   PARIS, February 22, 1795.

   SIR:

   As it is always painful to reproach those one would wish to respect, it is
   not without some difficulty that I have taken the resolution to write to
   you.The dangers to which I have been exposed cannot have been unknown to
   you, and the guarded silence you have observed upon that circumstance is
   what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a friend or as
   President of the United States.

   You knew enough of my character to be assured that I could not have
   deserved imprisonment in France; and, without knowing anything more than
   this, you had sufficient ground to have taken some interest for my safety.
   Every motive arising from recollection of times past ought to have
   suggested to you the propriety of such a measure. But I cannot find that
   you have so much as directed any inquiry to be made whether I was in
   prison or at liberty, dead or alive; what the cause of that imprisonment
   was, or whether there was any service or assistance you could render. Is
   this what I ought to have expected from America, after the part I had
   acted toward her, or will it redound to her honor or to yours, that I tell
   the story?

   I do not hesitate to say that you have not served America with more
   disinterestedness, or greater zeal, or more fidelity, than myself, and I
   know not if with better effect. After the Revolution of America was
   established I ventured into the new scenes of difficulties to extend the
   principles which that Revolution had produced, and you rested at home to
   partake of the advantages. In the progress of events, you beheld yourself
   a President in America, and me a prisoner in France. You folded your arms,
   forgot your friend and became silent.

   As everything I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wishes for
   the prosperity of America, I ought to be the more surprised at this
   conduct on the part of her Government. It leaves me but one mode of
   explanation, which is that everything is not as it ought to be amongst
   you, and that the presence of a man who might disapprove, and who had
   credit enough with the country to be heard and believed, was not wished
   for. This was the operating motive with the despotic faction that
   imprisoned me in France (though the pretense was, that I was a foreigner),
   and those that have been silent and inactive toward me in America, appear
   to me to have acted from the same motive. It is impossible for me to
   discover any other.

   After the part I have taken in the Revolution of America, it is natural
   that I feel interested in whatever relates to her character and
   prosperity. Though I am not on the spot to see what is immediately acting
   there, I see some part of what she is acting in Europe. For your own sake,
   as well as for that of America, I was both surprised and concerned at the
   appointment of Gouverneur Morris to be Minister to France. His conduct has
   proved that the opinion I had formed of that appointment was well founded.
   I wrote that opinion to Mr. Jefferson at the time, and I was frank enough
   to say the same thing to Morris-that it was an unfortunate appointment.
   His prating, insignificant pomposity rendered him at once offensive,
   suspected and ridiculous; and his total neglect of all business had so
   disgusted the Americans that they proposed drawing up a protest against
   him.

   He carried this neglect to such an extreme that it was necessary to inform
   him of it; and I asked him one day if he did not feel himself ashamed to
   take the money of the country, and do nothing for it? But Morris is so
   fond of profit and voluptuousness that he cares nothing about character.
   Had he not been removed at the time he was, I think his conduct would have
   precipitated the two countries into a rupture; and in this case, hated
   systematically as America is and ever will be by the British Government,
   and at the same time suspected by France, the commerce of America would
   have fallen a prey to both countries

   If the inconsistent conduct of Morris exposed the interest of America to
   some hazard in France, the pusillanimous conduct of Mr. Jay in England has
   rendered the American Government contemptible in Europe. Is it possible
   that any man who has contributed to the independence of America, and to
   free her from tyranny and injustice of the British Government, can read
   without shame and indignation the note of Jay to Grenville? It is a satire
   upon the Declaration of Independence, and an encouragement to the British
   Government to treat America with contempt. At the time this Minister of
   petitions was acting this miserable part he had every means in his hands
   to enable him to have done his business as he ought. The success or
   failure of his mission depended upon the success or failure of the French
   arms.

   Had France failed, Mr. Jay might have put his humble petition in his
   pocket and gone home. The case happened to be otherwise, and he has
   sacrificed the honor and perhaps all the advantages of it by turning
   petitioner. I take it for granted that he was sent over to demand
   indemnification for the captured property; and, in this case, if he
   thought he wanted a preamble to his demand, he might have said, "That,
   though the Government of England might suppose itself under the necessity
   of seizing American property bound to France, yet that supposed necessity
   could not preclude indemnification to the proprietors, who, acting under
   the authority of their own government, were not accountable to any other."
   But Mr. Jay sets out with an implied recognition of the right of the
   British Government to seize and condemn: for he enters his complaint
   against the irregularity of the seizures and the condemnation, as if they
   were reprehensible only by not being conformable to the terms of the
   proclamation under which they were seized.

   Instead of being the envoy of a government, he goes over like a lawyer to
   demand a new trial. I can hardly help thinking that Grenville wrote that
   note himself and Jay signed it; for the style of it is domestic and not
   diplomatic. The term, His Majesty, used without any descriptive epithet,
   always signifies the King, whom the Minister that speaks represents. If
   this sinking of the demand into a petition was a juggle between Grenville
   and Jay, to cover the indemnification, I think it will end in another
   juggle, that of never paying the money, and be made use of afterwards to
   preclude the right of demanding it: for Mr. Jay has virtually disowned the
   right by appealing to the magnanimity of His Majesty against the
   capturers. He has made this magnanimous majesty the umpire in the case,
   and the Government of the United States must abide by the decision. If,
   Sir, I turn some part of this business into ridicule, it is to avoid the
   unpleasant sensation of serious indignation.

   Among other things which I confess I do not understand, is the
   proclamation of neutrality. This has always appeared to me as an
   assumption on the part of the executive not warranted by the Constitution.
   But passing this over, as a disputable case, and considering it only as
   political, the consequence has been that of sustaining the losses of war
   without the balance of reprisals. When the profession of neutrality, on
   the part of America, was answered by hostilities on the part of Britain,
   the object and intention of that neutrality existed no longer; and to
   maintain it after this, was not only to encourage further insults and
   depredations, but was an informal breach of neutrality toward France, by
   passively contributing to the aid of her enemy. That the Government of
   England considered the American Government as pusillanimous, is evident
   from the increasing insolence of the conduct of the former toward the
   latter, till the affair of General Wayne. She then saw that it might be
   possible to kick a government into some degree of spirit.

   So far as the proclamation of neutrality was intended to prevent a
   dissolute spirit of privateering in America under foreign colors, it was
   undoubtedly laudable; but to continue it as a government neutrality, after
   the commerce of America was made war upon, was submission and not
   neutrality. I have heard so much about this thing called neutrality that I
   know not if the ungenerous and dishonorable silence (for I must call it
   such) that has been observed by your part of the Government toward me,
   during my imprisonment, has not in some measure arisen from that policy.

   Though I have written you this letter, you ought not to suppose it has
   been an agreeable undertaking to me. On the contrary, I assure you, it has
   caused me some disquietude. I am sorry you have given me cause to do it;
   for, as I have always remembered your former friendship with pleasure, I
   suffer a loss by your depriving me of that sentiment.

   THOMAS PAINE.

   That this letter was not written in very good temper, is very evident; but
   it was just such a letter as his conduct appeared to me to merit, and
   everything on his part since has served to confirm that opinion. Had I
   wanted a commentary on his silence, with respect to my imprisonment in
   France, some of his faction have furnished me with it. What I here allude
   to is a publication in a Philadelphia paper, copied afterwards into a New
   York paper, both under the patronage of the Washington faction, in which
   the writer, still supposing me in prison in France, wonders at my lengthy
   respite from the scaffold; and he marks his politics still further, by
   saying:

   It appears, moreover, that the people of England did not relish his
   (Thomas Paine's) opinions quite so well as he expected, and that for one
   of his last pieces, as destructive to the peace and happiness of their
   country (meaning, I suppose, the "Rights of Man"), they threatened our
   knight-errant with such serious vengeance, that, to avoid a trip to Botany
   Bay, he fled over to France, as a less dangerous voyage.

   I am not refuting or contradicting the falsehood of this publication, for
   it is sufficiently notorious; neither am I censuring the writer: on the
   contrary, I thank him for the explanation he has incautiously given of the
   principles of the Washington faction. Insignificant, however, as the piece
   is, it was capable of having some ill effects had it arrived in France
   during my imprisonment, and in the time of Robespierre; and I am not
   uncharitable in supposing that this was one of the intentions of the
   writer. (I know not who the writer of the piece is, but some of the
   Americans say it is Phineas Bond, an American refugee, but now a British
   consul; and that he writes under the signature of Peter Skunk or Peter
   Porcupine, or some such signature.-Author.)

   I have now done with Mr. Washington on the score of private affairs. It
   would have been far more agreeable to me had his conduct been such as not
   to have merited these reproaches. Errors or caprices of the temper can be
   pardoned and forgotten; but a cold deliberate crime of the heart such as
   Mr. Washington is capable of acting, is not to be washed away. I now
   proceed to other matter.

   After Jay's note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America, the character
   of everything that was to follow might be easily foreseen; and it was upon
   this anticipation that my letter of February the twenty-second was
   founded. The event has proved that I was not mistaken, except that it has
   been much worse than I expected.

   It would naturally occur to Mr. Washington, that the secrecy of Jay's
   mission to England, where there was already an American Minister, could
   not but create some suspicion in the French Government; especially as the
   conduct of Morris had been notorious, and the intimacy of Mr. Washington
   with Morris was known.

   The character which Mr. Washington has attempted to act in the world is a
   sort of nondescribable, chameleon-colored thing called prudence. It is, in
   many cases, a substitute for principle, and is so nearly allied to
   hypocrisy that it easily slides into it. His genius for prudence furnished
   him in this instance with an expedient that served, as is the natural and
   general character of all expedients, to diminish the embarrassments of the
   moment and multiply them afterwards; for he authorized it to be made known
   to the French Government, as a confidential matter (Mr. Washington should
   recollect that I was a member of the Convention, and had the means of
   knowing what I here state), he authorized it, I say, to be announced, and
   that for the purpose of preventing any uneasiness to France on the score
   of Mr. Jay's mission to England, that the object of that mission, and of
   Mr. Jay's authority, was restricted to that of demanding the surrender of
   the western posts, and indemnification for the cargoes captured in
   American vessels.

   Mr. Washington knows that this was untrue; and knowing this, he had good
   reason to himself for refusing to furnish the House of Representatives
   with copies of the instructions given to Jay, as he might suspect, among
   other things, that he should also be called upon for copies of
   instructions given to other Ministers, and that, in the contradiction of
   instructions, his want of integrity would be detected. Mr. Washington may
   now, perhaps, learn, when it is too late to be of any use to him, that a
   man will pass better through the world with a thousand open errors upon
   his back than in being detected in one sly falsehood. When one is
   detected, a thousand are suspected.

   The first account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being negotiated by
   Mr. Jay (for nobody suspected any), came in an English newspaper, which
   announced that a treaty offensive and defensive had been concluded between
   the United States of America and England. This was immediately denied by
   every American in Paris as an impossible thing; and though it was
   disbelieved by the French, it imprinted a suspicion that some underhand
   business was going forward. At length the treaty itself arrived, and every
   well-affected American blushed with shame. (It was the embarrassment into
   which the affairs and credit of America were thrown at this instant by the
   report above alluded to, that made it necessary to contradict it, and that
   by every means arising from opinion or founded upon authority. The
   Committee of Public Safety, existing at that time, had agreed to the full
   execution, on their part, of the treaty between America and France
   notwithstanding some equivocal conduct on the part of the American
   Government not very consistent with the good faith of an ally; but they
   were not in a disposition to be imposed upon by a counter-treaty. That Jay
   had no instructions beyond the points above stated, or none that could
   possibly be construed to extend to the length the British treaty goes, was
   a matter believed in America, in England and in France; and without going
   to any other source it followed naturally from the message of the
   President to Congress, when he nominated Jay upon that mission. The
   secretary of Mr. Jay came to Paris soon after the treaty with England had
   been concluded, and brought with him a copy of Mr. Jay's instructions,
   which he offered to show to me as a justification of Jay. I advised him,
   as a friend, not to show them to anybody, and did not permit him to show
   them to me. "Who is it," said I to him, "that you intend to implicate as
   censurable by showing those instructions? Perhaps that implication may
   fall upon your own government." Though I did not see the instructions, I
   could not be at a loss to understand that the American Administration had
   been playing a double game.- Author.)

   It is curious to observe how the appearance of characters will change,
   while the root that produces them remains the same. The Washington faction
   having waded through the slough of negotiation, and while it amused France
   with professions of friendship contrived to injure her, immediately throws
   off the hypocrite, and assumes the swaggering air of a bravado. The party
   papers of that imbecile administration were on this occasion filled with
   paragraphs about Sovereignty. A poltroon may boast of his sovereign right
   to let another kick him, and this is the only kind of sovereignty shown in
   the treaty with England. But those daring paragraphs, as Timothy Pickering
   [Secretary of State] well knows, were intended for France; without whose
   assistance, in men, money, and ships, Mr. Washington would have cut but a
   poor figure in the American war. But of his military talents I shall speak
   hereafter.

   I mean not to enter into any discussion of any article of Jay's Treaty; I
   shall speak only upon the whole of it. It is attempted to be justified on
   the ground of its not being a violation of any article or articles of the
   treaty preexisting with France. But the sovereign right of explanation
   does not lie with George Washington and his man Timothy; France, on her
   part, has, at least, an equal right: and when nations dispute, it is not
   so much about words as about things.

   A man, such as the world calls a sharper, and versed as Jay must be
   supposed to be in the quibbles of the law, may find a way to enter into
   engagements, and make bargains, in such a manner as to cheat some other
   party, without that party being able, as the phrase is, to take the law of
   him. This often happens in the cabalistical circle of what is called law.
   But when this is attempted to be acted on the national circle of treaties,
   it is too despicable to be defended, or to be permitted to exist.

   Yet this is the trick upon which Jay's Treaty is founded, so far as it has
   relation to the treaty preexisting with France. It is a counter-treaty to
   that treaty and perverts all the great articles of that treaty to the
   injury of France, and makes them operate as a bounty to England, with whom
   France is at war.

   The Washington Administration shows great desire that the treaty between
   France and the United States be preserved. Nobody can doubt their
   sincerity upon this matter. There is not a British minister, a British
   merchant, or a British agent or sailor in America, that does not anxiously
   wish the same thing. The treaty with France serves now as a passport to
   supply England with naval stores and other articles of American produce,
   while the same articles, when coming to France, are made contraband or
   seizable by Jay's Treaty with England. The treaty with France says that
   neutral ships make neutral property, and thereby gives protection to
   English property on board American ships; and Jay's Treaty delivers up
   French property on board American ships to be seized by the English. It is
   too paltry to talk of faith, of national honor, and of the preservation of
   treaties, while such a barefaced treachery as this stares the world in the
   face.

   The Washington Administration may save itself the trouble of proving to
   the French Government its most faithful intentions of preserving the
   treaty with France; for France has now no desire that it should be
   preserved. She had nominated an envoy extraordinary to America, to make
   Mr. Washington and his Government a present of the treaty, and to have no
   more to do with that, or with him. It was at the same time officially
   declared to the American Minister at Paris, that the French Republic had
   rather have the American Government for an open enemy than a treacherous
   friend. This, Sir, together with the internal distractions caused in
   America, and the loss of character in the world, is the eventful crisis,
   alluded to in the beginning of this letter, to which your double politics
   have brought the affairs of your country. It is time that the eyes of
   America be opened upon you.

   How France would have conducted herself toward America and American
   commerce, after all treaty stipulations had ceased, and under the sense of
   services rendered and injuries received, I know not. It is, however, an
   unpleasant reflection, that in all national quarrels, the innocent and
   even the friendly part of the community become involved with the culpable
   and the unfriendly; and as the accounts that arrived from America
   continued to manifest an invariable attachment in the general mass of the
   people to their original ally, in opposition to the new-fangled Washington
   faction-the resolutions that had been taken in France were suspended. It
   happened also, fortunately enough, that Gouverneur Morris was not minister
   at this time.

   There is, however, one point that still remains an embryo, and which,
   among other things, serves to show the ignorance of Washington
   treaty-makers, and their inattention to preexisting treaties, when they
   were employing themselves in framing or ratifying the new treaty with
   England.

   The second article of the treaty of commerce between the United States and
   France says:

   The most Christian King and the United States engage mutually, not to
   grant any particular favor to other nations in respect of commerce and
   navigation that shall not immediately become common to the other party,
   who" shall enjoy the same favor freely, if the concession was freely made,
   or on allowing the same compensation if the concession was conditional.

   All the concessions, therefore, made to England by Jay's Treaty are,
   through the medium of this second article in the preexisting treaty, made
   to France, and become engrafted into the treaty with France, and can be
   exercised by her as a matter of right, the same as by England.

   Jay's Treaty makes a concession to England, and that unconditionally, of
   seizing naval stores in American ships, and condemning them as contraband.
   It makes also a concession to England to seize provisions and other
   articles in American ships. Other articles are all other articles, and
   none but an ignoramus, or something worse, would have put such a phrase
   into a treaty. The condition annexed in this case is that the provisions
   and other articles so seized are to be paid for at a price to be agreed
   upon.

   Mr. Washington, as President, ratified this treaty after he knew the
   British Government had recommended an indiscriminate seizure of provisions
   and all other articles in American ships; and it is now known that those
   seizures were made to fit out the expedition going to Quiberon Bay, and it
   was known beforehand that they would be made.

   The evidence goes also a good way to prove that Jay and Grenville
   understood each other upon that subject. Mr. Pinckney [U. S. Minister to
   England], when he passed through France on his way to Spain, spoke of the
   recommencement of the seizures as a thing that would take place. The
   French Government had by some means received information from London to
   the same purpose, with the addition that the recommencement of the
   seizures would cause no misunderstanding between the British and American
   Governments.

   Grenville, in defending himself against the opposition in Parliament, on
   account of the scarcity of corn, said (see his speech at the opening of
   the Parliament that met October 29, 1795) that the supplies for the
   Quiberon expedition were furnished out of the American ships, and all the
   accounts received at that time from England stated that those seizures
   were made under the treaty.

   After the supplies for the Quiberon expedition had been procured, and the
   expected success had failed, the seizures were countermanded; and had the
   French seized provision vessels going to England, it is probable that the
   Quiberon expedition could not have been attempted.

   In one point of view, the treaty with England operates as a loan to the
   English Government. It gives permission to that Government to take
   American property at sea, to any amount, and pay for it when it suits her;
   and besides this, the treaty is in every point of view a surrender of the
   rights of American commerce and navigation, and a refusal to France of the
   rights of neutrality. The American flag is not now a neutral flag to
   France; Jay's Treaty of surrender gives a monopoly of it to England.

   On the contrary, the treaty of commerce between America and France was
   formed on the most liberal principles, and calculated to give the greatest
   encouragement to the infant commerce of America. France was neither a
   carrier nor exporter of naval stores or of provisions. Those articles
   belonged wholly to America, and they had all the protection in that treaty
   which a treaty could give. But so much has that treaty been perverted that
   the liberality of it on the part of France has served to encourage Jay to
   form a counter-treaty with England; for he must have supposed the hands of
   France tied up by her treaty with America, when he was making such large
   concessions in favor of England.

   The injury which Mr. Washington's Administration has done to the character
   as well as to the commerce of America is too great to be repaired by him.
   Foreign nations will be shy of making treaties with a government that has
   given the faithless example of perverting the liberality of a former
   treaty to the injury of the party with whom it was made.

   In what a fraudulent light must Mr. Washington's character appear in the
   world, when his declarations and his conduct are compared together! Here
   follows the letter he wrote to the Committee of Public Safety, while Jay
   was negotiating in profound secrecy this treacherous

   treaty:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   George Washington, President of the United States of America, to the
   Representatives of the French people, members of the Committee of Public
   Safety of the French Republic, the great and good friend and ally of the
   United States.

   On the intimation of the wish of the French Republic that a new Minister
   should be sent from the United States, I resolved to manifest my sense of
   the readiness with which my request was fulfilled [that of recalling
   Genet], by immediately fulfilling the request of your Government [that of
   recalling Morris].

   It was some time before a character could be obtained, worthy of the high
   office of expressing the attachment of the United States to the happiness
   of our allies, and drawing closer the bonds of our friendship. I have now
   made choice of James Monroe, one of our distinguished citizens, to reside
   near the French Republic, in quality of Minister Plenipotentiary of the
   United States of America.

   He is instructed to bear to you our sincere solicitude for your welfare,
   and to cultivate with zeal the cordiality so happily subsisting between
   us. From a knowledge of his fidelity, probity, and good conduct, I have
   entire confidence that he will render himself acceptable to you, and give
   effect to your desire of preserving and advancing, on all occasions, the
   interest and connection of the two nations. I beseech you, therefore, to
   give full credence to whatever he shall say to you on the part of the
   United States, and most of all, when he shall assure you that your
   prosperity is an object of our affection. And I pray God to have the
   French Republic in His holy keeping.

   GEORGE WASHINGTON.

   Was it by entering into a treaty with England to surrender French property
   on board American ships to be seized by the English, while English
   property on board American ships was declared by the French treaty not to
   be siezable, that the bonds of friendship between America and France were
   to be drawn the closer?

   Was it by declaring naval stores contraband when coming to France, while
   by the French treaty they were not contraband when going to England, that
   the connection between France and America was to be advanced?

   Was it by opening the American ports to the British navy in the present
   war, from which ports the same navy had been expelled by the aid solicited
   from France in the American war (and that aid gratuitously given) that the
   gratitude of America was to be shown, and the solicitude spoken of in the
   letter demonstrated?

   As the letter was addressed to the Committee of Public Safety, Mr.
   Washington did not expect it would get abroad in the world, or be seen by
   any other eye than that of Robespierre, or be heard by any other ear than
   that of the Committee; that it would pass as a whisper across the
   Atlantic, from one dark chamber to the other, and there terminate. It was
   calculated to remove from the mind of the Committee all suspicion upon
   Jay's mission to England, and, in this point of view, it was suited to the
   circumstances of the movement then passing; but as the event of that
   mission has proved the letter to be hypocritical, it serves no other
   purpose of the present moment than to show that the writer is not to be
   credited.

   Two circumstances serve to make the reading of the letter necessary in the
   Convention. The one was that they who succeeded on the fall of Robespierre
   found it most proper to act with publicity; the other, to extinguish the
   suspicions which the strange conduct of Morris had occasioned in France.

   When the British treaty, and the ratification of it by Mr. Washington, was
   known in France, all further declarations from him of his good disposition
   as an ally and friend passed for so many ciphers; but still it appeared
   necessary to him to keep up the farce of declarations. It is stipulated in
   the British treaty that commissioners are to report at the end of two
   years on the case of neutral ships making neutral property. In the
   meantime, neutral ships do not make neutral property, according to the
   British treaty, and they do according to the French treaty.

   The preservation, therefore, of the French treaty became of great
   importance to England, as by that means she can employ American ships as
   carriers, while the same advantage is denied to France. Whether the French
   treaty could exist as a matter of right after this clandestine perversion
   of it could not but give some apprehensions to the partisans of the
   British treaty, and it became necessary to them to make up, by fine words,
   what was wanting in good actions.

   An opportunity offered to that purpose. The Convention, on the public
   reception of Mr. Monroe, ordered the American flag and the French flags to
   be displayed unitedly in the hall of the Convention. Mr. Monroe made a
   present of an American flag for the purpose. The Convention returned this
   compliment by sending a French flag to America, to be presented by their
   Minister, Mr. Adet, to the American Government. This resolution passed
   long before Jay's Treaty was known or suspected: it passed in the days of
   confidence; but the flag was not presented by Mr. Adet till several months
   after the treaty had been ratified. Mr. Washington made this the occasion
   of saying some fine things to the French Minister; and the better to get
   himself into tune to do this he began by saying the finest things of
   himself.

   Born, Sir (said he), in a land of liberty; having early learned its value;
   having engaged in a perilous conflict to defend it; having, in a word,
   devoted the best years of my life to secure its permanent establishment in
   my own country; my anxious recollections, my sympathetic feelings, and my
   best wishes are irresistibly excited, whenever, in any country, I see an
   oppressed people unfurl the banner of freedom.

   Mr. Washington, having expended so many fine phrases upon himself, was
   obliged to invent a new one for the French, and he calls them "wonderful
   people!" The coalesced powers acknowledged as much.

   It is laughable to hear Mr. Washington talk of his sympathetic feelings,
   who has always been remarked, even among his friends, for not having any.
   He has, however, given no proofs of any to me. As to the pompous encomiums
   he so liberally pays to himself, on the score of the American Revolution,
   the reality of them may be questioned; and since he has forced them so
   much into notice, it is fair to examine his pretensions.

   A stranger might be led to suppose, from the egotism with which Mr.
   Washington speaks, that himself, and himself only, had generated,
   conducted, completed, and established the Revolution: in fine, that it was
   all his own doing.

   In the first place, as to the political part, he had no share in it; and,
   therefore, the whole of that is out of the question with respect to him.
   There remains, then, only the military part; and it would have been
   prudent in Mr. Washington not to have awakened inquiry upon that subject.
   Fame then was cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply; and nobody was disposed to
   take away the laurels that, whether they were acquired or not, had been
   given.

   Mr. Washington's merit consisted in constancy. But constancy was the
   common virtue of the Revolution. Who was there that was inconstant ? I
   know but of one military defection, that of Arnold; and I know of no
   political defection among those who made themselves eminent when the
   Revolution was formed by the Declaration of Independence. Even Silas
   Deane, though he attempted to defraud, did not betray.

   But when we speak of military character, something more is to be
   understood than constancy; and something more ought to be understood than
   the Fabian system of doing nothing. The nothing part can be done by
   anybody. Old Mrs. Thompson, the housekeeper of headquarters (who
   threatened to make the sun and the wind shine through Rivington of New
   York), could not have done it as well as Mr. Washington. Deborah would
   have been as good as Barak.

   Mr. Washington had the nominal rank of Commander-in-Chief, but he was not
   so in fact. He had, in reality, only a separate command. He had no control
   over, or direction of, the army to the northward under Gates, that
   captured Burgoyne; nor of that to the South under [Nathanael] Greene, that
   recovered the Southern States. (See Mr. Winterbotham's valuable History of
   America lately published.-Author.) The nominal rank, however, of
   Commander-in-Chief served to throw upon him the lustre of those actions,
   and to make him appear as the soul and center of all military operations
   in America.

   He commenced his command June, 1775, during the time the Massachusetts
   army lay before Boston, and after the affair of Bunker Hill. The
   commencement of his command was the commencement of inactivity. Nothing
   was afterwards done, or attempted to be done, during the nine months he
   remained before Boston.

   If we may judge from the resistance made at Concord, and afterwards at
   Bunker Hill, there was a spirit of enterprise at that time, which the
   presence of Mr. Washington chilled into cold defense. By the advantage of
   a good exterior he attracts respect, which his habitual silence tends to
   preserve; but he has not the talent of inspiring ardor in an army. The
   enemy removed from Boston in March, 1776, to wait for reinforcements from
   Europe, and to take a more advantageous position at New York.

   The inactivity of the campaign of 1775, on the part of General Washington,
   when the enemy had a less force than in any other future period of the
   war, and the injudicious choice of positions taken by him in the campaign
   of 1776, when the enemy had its greatest force, necessarily produced the
   losses and misfortunes that marked that gloomy campaign. The positions
   taken were either islands or necks of land. In the former, the enemy, by
   the aid of their ships, could bring their whole force against a part of
   General Washington's, as in the affair of Long Island; and in the latter,
   he might be shut up as in the bottom of a bag.

   This had nearly been the case at New York", and it was so in part; it was
   actually the case at Fort Washington; and it would have been the case at
   Fort Lee, if General Greene had not moved precipitately off, leaving
   everything behind, and by gaining Hackensack bridge, got out of the bag of
   Bergen Neck.

   How far Mr. Washington, as general, is blamable for these matters, I am
   not undertaking to determine; but they are evidently defects in military
   geography. The successful skirmishes at the close of that campaign
   (matters that would scarcely be noticed in a better state of things) make
   the brilliant exploits of General Washington's seven campaigns. No wonder
   we see so much pusillanimity in the President, when we see so little
   enterprise in the General!

   The campaign of 1777 became famous, not by anything on the part of General
   Washington, but by the capture of General Burgoyne, and the army under his
   command, by the Northern Army at Saratoga, under General Gates. So totally
   distinct and unconnected were the two armies of Washington and Gates, and
   so independent was the latter of the authority of the nominal
   Commander-in-Chief, that the two generals did not so much as correspond,
   and it was only by a letter of General (since Governor) Clinton, that
   General Washington was informed of that event. The British took possession
   of Philadelphia this year, which they evacuated the next, just time enough
   to save their heavy baggage and fleet of transports from capture by the
   French Admiral d'Estaing, who arrived at the mouth of the Delaware soon
   after.

   The capture of Burgoyne gave an eclat in Europe to the American arms, and
   facilitated the alliance with France. The eclat, however, was not kept up
   by anything on the part of General Washington. The same unfortunate
   languor that marked his entrance into the field, continued always.
   Discontent began to prevail strongly against him, and a party was formed
   in Congress, while sitting at York Town, in Pennsylvania, for removing him
   from the command of the army. The hope, however, of better times, the news
   of the alliance with France, and the unwillingness of showing discontent,
   dissipated the matter.

   Nothing was done in the campaigns of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the part where
   General Washington commanded, except the taking of Stony Point by General
   Wayne. The Southern States in the meantime were over-run by the enemy.
   They were afterwards recovered by General Greene, who had in a very great
   measure created the army that accomplished that recovery.

   In all this General Washington had no share. The Fabian system of war,
   followed by him, began now to unfold itself with all its evils; but what
   is Fabian war without Fabian means to support it? The finances of
   Congress, depending wholly on emissions of paper money, were exhausted.
   Its credit was gone. The Continental Treasury was not able to pay the
   expense of a brigade of wagons to transport the necessary stores to the
   army, and yet the sole object, the establishment of the Revolution, was a
   thing of remote distance. The time I am now speaking of is in the latter
   end of the year 1780.

   In this situation of things it was found not only expedient, but
   absolutely necessary, for Congress to state the whole case to its ally. I
   knew more of this matter (before it came into Congress or was known to
   General Washington), of its progress, and its issue, than I choose to
   state in this letter. Colonel John Laurens was sent to France as an envoy
   extraordinary on this occasion, and by a private agreement between him and
   me I accompanied him. We sailed from Boston in the Alliance frigate,
   February 11, 1781. France had already done much in accepting and paying
   bills drawn by Congress. She was now called upon to do more.

   The event of Colonel Laurens's mission, with the aid of the venerable
   Minister, Franklin, was that France gave in money, as a present, six
   millions of livres, and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to send a
   fleet of not less than thirty sail of the line, at her own expense, as an
   aid to America. Colonel Laurens and myself returned from Brest the first
   of June following, taking with us two millions and a half of livres
   (upwards of one hundred thousand pounds sterling) of the money given, and
   convoying two ships with stores.

   We arrived at Boston the twenty-fifth of August following. De Grasse
   arrived with the French fleet in the Chesapeake at the same time, and was
   afterwards joined by that of Barras, making thirty-one sail of the line.
   The money was transported in wagons from Boston to the bank at
   Philadelphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has since put himself at
   the head of the list of petitioners in favor of the British treaty, was
   then president. And it was by the aid of this money, and this fleet, and
   of Rochambeau's army, that Cornwallis was taken; the laurels of which have
   been unjustly given to Mr. Washington. His merit in that affair was no
   more than that of any other American officer.

   I have had, and still have, as much pride in the American Revolution as
   any man, or as Mr. Washington has a right to have; but that pride has
   never made me forgetful whence the great aid came that completed the
   business. Foreign aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the
   commencement of the Revolution. It is one of the subjects treated of in
   the pamphlet "Common Sense," but as a matter that could not be hoped for,
   unless independence was declared. The aid, however, was greater than could
   have been expected.

   It is as well the ingratitude as the pusillanimity of Mr. Washington, and
   the Washington faction, that has brought upon America the loss of
   character she now suffers in the world, and the numerous evils her
   commerce has undergone, and to which it is yet exposed. The British
   Ministry soon found out what sort of men they had to deal with, and they
   dealt with them accordingly; and if further explanation was wanting, it
   has been fully given since, in the snivelling address of the New York
   Chamber of Commerce to the President, and in that of sundry merchants of
   Philadelphia which was not much better.

   When the Revolution of America was finally established by the termination
   of the war, the world gave her credit for great character; and she had
   nothing to do but to stand firm upon that ground. The British Ministry had
   their hands too full of trouble to have provoked a rupture with her, had
   she shown a proper resolution to defend her rights. But encouraged as they
   were by the submissive character of the American Administration, they
   proceeded from insult to insult, till none more were left to be offered.
   The proposals made by Sweden and Denmark to the American Administration
   were disregarded. I know not if so much as an answer has been returned to
   them.

   The Minister penitentiary (as some of the British prints called him), Mr.
   Jay, was sent on a pilgrimage to London to make up all by penance and
   petition. In the meantime the lengthy and drowsy writer of the pieces
   signed CAMILLUS held himself in reserve to vindicate everything; and to
   sound in America the tocsin of terror upon the inexhaustible re- sources
   of England. Her resources, says he, are greater than those of all the
   other powers. This man is so intoxicated with fear and finance that he
   knows not the difference between plus and minus-between a hundred pounds
   in hand and a hundred pounds worse than nothing.

   The commerce of America, so far as it had been established by all the
   treaties that had been formed prior to that by Jay, was free, and the
   principles upon which it was established were good. That ground ought
   never to have been departed from. It was the justifiable ground of right,
   and no temporary difficulties ought to have induced an abandonment of it.
   The case is now otherwise. The ground, the scene, the pretensions, the
   everything, are changed. The commerce of America is, by Jay's Treaty, put
   under foreign dominion. The sea is not free for her. Her right to navigate
   it is reduced to the right of escaping; that is, until some ship of
   England or France stops her vessels, and carries them into port. Every
   article of American produce, whether from the sea or the sand, fish,
   flesh, vegetable, or manufacture, is, by Jay's Treaty, made either
   contraband or siezable. Nothing is exempt.

   In all other treaties of commerce, the article which enumerates the
   contraband articles, such as firearms, gunpowder, etc., is followed by
   another article which enumerates the articles not contraband: but it is
   not so in Jay's Treaty. There is no exempting article. Its place is
   supplied by the article for seizing and carrying into port; and the
   sweeping phrase of "provisions and other article/' includes everything.
   There never was such a base and servile treaty of surrender since treaties
   began to exist.

   This is the ground upon which America now stands. All her rights of
   commerce and navigation are to begin anew, and that with loss of character
   to begin with. If there is sense enough left in the heart to call a blush
   into the cheek, the Washington Administration must be ashamed to appear.
   And as to you, Sir, treacherous in private friendship (for so you have
   been to me, and that in the day of danger) and a hypocrite in public life,
   the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are an apostate or an
   impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles, or whether you ever
   had any.

   THOMAS PAINE.
