   To Doctor James O'Fallon1  February the 17, 1793

   PASSY, NEAR PARIS,

   DEAR SIR:

   I had the pleasure of your favor from Kentucky, which came in the French
   Resident's dispatches, with which the offers and propositions of General G
   R Clarke, for an expedition against Louisiana, etc. had arrived, and were
   received by the Provisionary Executive Council of the Republic with
   satisfaction.2

   I should have replied sooner; but waited a few days, that I may see what
   the Resident had reported, and after using my best exertions in behalf of
   your friend's design, to discover what was likely to be done, in the event
   of a Spanish war. I have only to inform you, at this early stage of the
   business, that the General's offers and propositions are actually under
   consideration; and a doubt exists not with myself, should a Spanish war
   take place, but that every, or the greater part of his terms will be
   complied with. In my private opinion, a Spanish war is inevitable. You
   may, therefore, in all human probability, expect very soon to hear of the
   General's nomination to the post and command solicited by him. The
   knowledge which report hath brought me of his character, Mr. Jefferson's
   private sentiments respecting him, which the Resident has, as I
   understand, transmitted, and the reliance I have in your narrative,-which
   confirms the whole, will excite every exertion on part, to have the
   expedition promoted as you wish. In a week or two hence, a war against
   Spain will, in all likelihood, be declared. All we fear is, that the
   intrigues of certain personages in the American cabinet, who are friends
   of Britain, and the votaries of Kings, may obstruct the General, in his
   plans of raising men, and procuring officers. The principal characters
   among the French inhabitants of Louisiana, have already petitioned this
   convention, for the reduction of that country from the vile servitude
   under which it actually groans.

   This expedition, if successful, will probably promote every end of your
   Agency, the purposes of which Gouverneur Morris of New York, the present
   American Minister at Paris, has, long since, unfolded to me. I therefore
   submit it to your consideration, whether you ought not, in person, to
   accompany this expedition, to promote it with all your might, and even to
   act in it as a French officer. Such friendly exertions in favor of the
   enterprise, will most certainly recommend you, and the Company you
   represent to the notice and grateful esteem of our magnanimous free
   nation. In the hoped for contingency, that the arms of the Republic shall
   prove victorious in this expedition, and dislodge the Spaniard from all
   the posts which he holds within the three Grants of Georgia; the lands, in
   the first instance, will be considered, by the Republic, as the conquest
   of Spanish territory. In such case, I make not the least doubt, but that
   the Georgia Grants, the lowest down at least, will be confirmed to the
   companies that shall have been assistants in the expedition, by themselves
   or their Agents. This, My dear Sir, I only offer, as the sentiments of a
   private man. Should the Georgia Grant, or Grants ever revert to the United
   States; it must be by treaty, or exchange; and then even, the actual
   possessors, under this Republic, will infallibly become confirmed in their
   rights, under some clause in the deed of cession.

   Your instructive correspondence shall ever be pleasing to me. Give me
   every intelligence and, write often. Please to direct under cover of the
   Ambassador, Mr. Genet's address. He is my sincere friend, and your name is
   already made known to him by me. He is to set out for America speedily3.
   The rulers of this Republic hold him in very high estimation.

   If as yet in the habits of writing; this, My Dear Doctor, is your precious
   time. Never was there a cause so deserving of your pen. I have tried the
   force of mine, and with some success. The first characters in Europe are
   in arms; some with the bayonet, some with the pen, and some with the
   two-edged sword of Declamation, in favor of Liberty. The tyrants of the
   earth are leagued against France; but with little effect. Although
   single-handed and alone, she still stands unshaken, unsubdued,
   unsubdueable, and undaunted: for our brave men fight not, as the troops of
   other nations, like Slaves chained to the oar of compulsory power. They
   fight freely, and for conscience sake. The nation will perish to a man, or
   be free. France can never fall; but by misapplying her own strength.

   This being Sunday, and at my little retreat, a few miles from Paris, where
   I expect some American friends to dinner; I must defer what more I had to
   say. This letter is risked by a private hand, who proceeds immediately to
   New York, and is charged to have it conveyed to you with all the security
   possible. Fail not to write to me, and believe me to be, with unfeigned
   sincerity, and best wishes for your health and prosperity.

   Dear Sir Your true friend and wellwisher

   THOMAS PAINE.

   1. This letter is printed from the original manuscript in the Lyman
   Copeland Draper Collection through the courtesy of the Wisconsin State
   Historical Society.

   James O'Fallon was an Irish adventurer who had been active in the
   Revolutionary movement in North Carolina. After the war he turned to land
   speculation and engaged in intrigues with the Spanish, but during the
   summer of 1791 advocated taking possession of lands which had been granted
   by the State of Georgia to the South Carolina Yazoo Company over which
   Spain claimed jurisdiction. George Rogers Clark, hero of the North-west
   during the American Revolution, was to lead an expedition of one thousand
   armed men to seize this land which extended from the mouth of the Yazoo
   River along the Mississippi to an area close to Natchez. The expedition
   was halted when President Washington issued a proclamation forbidding the
   project. O'Fallon had married Clark's daughter, but by the time Paine's
   letter reached the United States the two men were on anything but friendly
   terms.-P.Foner.

   2. Paine's statement proves that Clark suggested to the French authorities
   late in 1792 that they support his plan to lead a filibustering expedition
   to recover Louisiana, held by Spain, for France, and that his proposal
   received favorable consideration. The French resident at Philadelphia in
   1792, referred to by Paine, was Col. J. B. Ternant. He had been appointed
   by the king in the spring of 1791.-P. Foner

   3. Edmond-Charles-Edouard Genet, wealthy representative of the Girondins,
   went as French minister to the United States. His conduct in this country
   played right into the hands of the reactionary Federalists who hated the
   French Revolution. For one thing, he organized expeditions on American
   soil against Spanish Louisiana and British Florida. For another, he
   threatened an "appeal to the people" over Washington's head to gain
   financial and military support for France. Genet was removed when the
   Jacobins replaced the Girondists in France. The proposed expedition
   against Louisiana failed when Washington demanded that Genet should be
   recalled, and when the President added to this a proclamation which
   forbade any American citizen to enlist in such a project.-P.Foner.
