   Foner's Introduction:  The case brought by the English government against
   Paine was set down in the Calendar for June 8, 1792. Paine was in the
   court that day, but to his disappointment the trial was postponed to
   December 18. Meanwhile he continued to address letters to government
   officials filled with irony and sarcasm.

                                ***************

   LORD LIEUTENANT OF THE COUNTY OF SURRY; ON THE SUBJECT OF THE LATE
   EXCELLENT Proclamation:-OR THE Chairman WHO SHALL PRESIDE AT THE MEETING
   TO BE HELD AT EPSOM, JUNE 18.

   FIRST LETTER, DATED AT LONDON, JUNE 17TH, 1792.

   SIR,

   I HAVE seen in the public newspapers the following advertisement, to wit-

   "To the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, Freeholders, and other Inhabitants of
   the county of Surry.

   "At the requisition and desire of several of the freeholders of the
   county, I am, in the absence of the Sheriff, to desire the favor of your
   attendance, at a meeting to be held at Epsom, on Monday, the 18th instant,
   at 12 o'clock at noon, to consider of an humble address to his MAJESTY, to
   express our grateful approbation of his MAJESTY'S paternal, and well-timed
   attendance to the public welfare, in his late most gracious Proclamation
   against the enemies of our happy Constitution.

   (Signed.) ONSLOW CRANLEY."

   Taking it for granted, that the aforesaid advertisement, equally as
   obscure as the proclamation to which it refers, has nevertheless some
   meaning, and is intended to effect some purpose; and as a prosecution
   (whether wisely or unwisely, justly or unjustly) is already commenced
   against a work entitled RIGHTS OF MAN, of which I have the honor and
   happiness to be the author; I feel it necessary to address this letter to
   you, and to request that it may be read publicly to the gentlemen who
   shall meet at Epsom in consequence of the advertisement.

   The work now under prosecution is, I conceive, the same work which is
   intended to be suppressed by the aforesaid Proclamation. Admitting this to
   be the case, the gentlemen of the County of Surrey are called upon by
   somebody to condemn a work, and they are at the same time forbidden by the
   Proclamation to know what that work is; and they are further called upon
   to give their aid and assistance to prevent other people from knowing it
   also. It is therefore necessary that the author, for his own
   justification, as well as to prevent the gentlemen who shall meet from
   being imposed upon by misrepresentation, should give some outlines of the
   principles and plans which that work contains.

   The work, Sir, in question, contains, first, an investigation of general
   principles of government.

   It also distinguishes government into two classes or systems, the one the
   hereditary system; the other the representative system; and it compares
   these two systems with each other.

   It shows that what is called hereditary government cannot exist as a
   matter of right; because hereditary government always means a government
   yet to come; and the case always is, that those who are to live afterwards
   have always the same right to establish a government for themselves as the
   people who had lived before them.

   It also shows the defect to which hereditary government is unavoidably
   subject: that it must, from the nature of it, throw government into the
   hands of men totally unworthy of it from the want of principle, and
   unfitted for it from want of capacity. James II and many others are
   recorded in the English history as proofs of the former of those cases,
   and instances are to be found all over Europe to prove the truth of the
   latter.

   It then shows that the representation system is the only true system of
   government; that it is also the only system under which the liberties of
   any people can be permanently secure; and, further, that it is the only
   one that can continue the same equal probability at all times of admitting
   of none but men properly qualified, both by principles and abilities, into
   government, and of excluding such as are otherwise.

   The work shows also, by plans and calculations not hitherto denied nor
   controverted, not even by the prosecution that is commenced, that the
   taxes now existing may be reduced at least six millions, that taxes may be
   entirely taken off from the poor, who are computed at one third of the
   nation; and that taxes on the other two thirds may be considerably
   reduced; that the aged poor may be comfortably provided for, and the
   children of poor families properly educated; that fifteen thousand
   soldiers, and the same number of sailors, may be allowed three shillings
   per week during life out of the surplus taxes; and also that a
   proportionate allowance may be made to the officers, and the pay of the
   remaining soldiers and sailors be raised; and that it is better to apply
   the surplus taxes to those purposes, than to consume them on lazy and
   profligate placemen and pensioners; and that the revenue, said to be
   twenty thousand pounds per annum, raised by a tax upon coals, and given to
   the Duke of Richmond, is a gross imposition upon all the people of London,
   and ought to be instantly abolished.

   This, Sir, is a concise abstract of the principles and plans contained in
   the work that is now prosecuted, and for the suppression of which the
   Proclamation appears to be intended; but as it is impossible that I can,
   in the compass of a letter, bring into view all the matters contained in
   the work, and as it is proper that the gentlemen who may compose that
   meeting should know what the merits or demerits of it are, before they
   come to any resolutions, either directly or indirectly relating thereto, I
   request the honor of presenting them with one hundred copies of the second
   part of the "Rights of Man," and also one thousand copies of my letter to
   Mr. Dundas, which I have directed to be sent to Epsom for that purpose;
   and I beg the favor of the chairman to take the trouble of presenting them
   to the gentlemen who shall meet on that occasion, with my sincere wishes
   for their happiness, and for that of the nation in general.

   Having now closed thus much of the subject of my letter, I next come to
   speak of what has relation to me personally. I am well aware of the
   delicacy that attends it, but the purpose of calling the meeting appears
   to me so inconsistent with that justice that is always due between man and
   man, that it is proper I should (as well on account of the gentlemen who
   may meet, as on my own account) explain myself fully and candidly thereon.

   I have already informed the gentlemen, that a prosecution is commenced
   against a work of which I have the honor and happiness to be the author;
   and I have good reasons for believing that the Proclamation which the
   gentlemen are called to consider, and to present an address upon, is
   purposely calculated to give an impression to the jury before whom that
   matter is to come. In short, that it is dictating a verdict by
   proclamation; and I consider the instigators of the meeting to be held at
   Epsom, as aiding and abetting the same improper, and, in my opinion,
   illegal purpose, and that in a manner very artfully contrived, as I shall
   now show.

   Had a meeting been called of the Freeholders of the County of Middlesex,
   the gentlemen who had composed that meeting would have rendered themselves
   objectionable as persons to serve on a jury, before whom a judicial case
   was afterwards to come. But by calling a meeting out of the County of
   Middlesex, that matter is artfully avoided, and the gentlemen of Surrey
   are summoned, as if it were intended thereby to give a tone to the sort of
   verdict which the instigators of the meeting no doubt wish should be
   brought in, and to give countenance to the jury in so doing.

   I am, sir,

   With much respect to the

   Gentlemen who shall meet,

   Their and your obedient and humble servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

    

   SECOND LETTER, DATED AT LONDON, JUNE 21, 1792.

   Sir: When I wrote you the letter which Mr. Home Tooke did me the favor to
   present to you, as chairman of the meeting held at Epsom, Monday, June 18,
   it was not with much expectation that you would do me the justice of
   permitting or recommending it to be publicly read. I am well aware that
   the signature of THOMAS PAINE has something in it dreadful to sinecure
   placemen and pensioners; and when you, on seeing the letter opened,
   informed the meeting that it was signed THOMAS PAINE, and added in a note
   of exclamation, "the common enemy o-L- us all," you spoke one of the
   greatest truths you ever uttered, if you confine the expression to men of
   the same description with yourself; men living in indolence and luxury, on
   the spoil and labors of the public.

   The letter has since appeared in the Argus? and probably in other papers.
   It will justify itself; but if anything on that account has been wanting,
   your conduct at the meeting would have supplied the omission. You there
   sufficiently proved that I was not mistaken in supposing that the meeting
   was called to give an indirect aid to the prosecution commenced against a
   work, the reputation of which will long outlive the memory of the
   Pensioner I am writing to.

   When meetings, Sir, are called by the partisans of the Court, to preclude
   the nation the right of investigating systems and principles of
   government, and of exposing errors and defects, under the pretense of
   prosecuting an individual-it furnishes an additional motive for
   maintaining sacred that violated right.

   The principles and arguments contained in the work in question, "Rights of
   Man," have stood, and they now stand, and I believe ever will stand,
   unrefuted. They are stated in a fair and open manner to the world, and
   they have already received the public approbation of a greater number of
   men, of the best of characters, of every denomination of religion, and of
   every rank in life (placemen and pensioners excepted) than all the juries
   that shall meet in England for ten years to come, will amount to; and I
   have, moreover, good reasons for believing that the approvers of that
   work, as well private as public, are already more numerous than all the
   present electors throughout the nation.

   Not less than forty pamphlets, intended as answers thereto, have appeared,
   and as suddenly disappeared; scarcely are the titles of any of them
   remembered, notwithstanding their endeavors have been aided by all the
   daily abuse which the court and ministerial newspapers, for almost a year
   and a half, could bestow, both upon the work and the author; and now that
   every attempt to refute, and every abuse has failed, the invention of
   calling the work a libel has been hit upon, and the discomfited party has
   pusillanimously retreated to prosecution and a jury, and obscure
   addresses.

   As I well know that a long letter from me will not be agreeable to you, I
   will relieve your uneasiness by making it as short as I conveniently can;
   and will conclude it with taking up the subject at that part where Mr.
   Home Tooke was interrupted from going on when at the meeting.

   That gentleman was stating, that the situation you stood in rendered it
   improper for you to appear actively in a scene in which your private
   interest was too visible: that you were a bedchamber lord at a thousand a
   year, and a pensioner at three thousand pounds a year more- and here he
   was stopped by the little but noisy circle you had collected round. Permit
   me then, Sir, to add an explanation to his words, for the benefit of your
   neighbors, and with which, and a few observations, I shall close my
   letter.

   When it was reported in the English newspapers, some short time since that
   the Empress of Russia had given to one of her minions a large tract of
   country and several thousands of peasants as property, it very justly
   provoked indignation and abhorrence in those who heard it. But if we
   compare the mode practised in England, with that which appears to us so
   abhorrent in Russia, it will be found to amount to very near the same
   thing;-for example-

   As the whole of the revenue in England is drawn by taxes from the pockets
   of the people, those things called gifts and grants (of which kind are all
   pensions and sinecure places) are paid out of that stock. The difference,
   therefore, between the two modes is, that in England the money is
   collected by the government, and then given to the pensioner, and in
   Russia he is left to collect it for himself.

   The smallest sum which the poorest family in a county so near London as
   Surrey, can be supposed to pay annually, of taxes, is not less than five
   pounds and as your sinecure of one thousand, and pension of three thousand
   per annum, are made up of taxes paid by eight hundred such poor families,
   it comes to the same thing as if the eight hundred families had been given
   to you, as in Russia, and you had collected the money on your account.
   Were you to say that you are not quartered particularly on the people of
   Surrey, but on the nation at large, the objection would amount to nothing;
   for as there are more pensioners than counties, every one may be
   considered as quartered on that in which he lives.

   What honor or happiness you can derive from being the PRINCIPAL PAUPER of
   the neighborhood, and occasioning a greater expense than the poor, the
   aged, and the infirm, for ten miles round you, I leave you to enjoy. At
   the same time I can see that it is no wonder you should be strenuous in
   suppressing a book which strikes at the root of those abuses. No wonder
   that you should be against reforms, against the freedom of the press, and
   the right of investigation. To you, and to others of your description,
   these are dreadful things; but you should also consider, that the motives
   which prompt you to act, ought, by reflection, to compel you to be silent.

   Having now returned your compliment, and sufficiently tired your patience,
   I take my leave of you, with mentioning, that if you had not prevented my
   former letter from being read at the meeting, you would not have had the
   trouble of reading this; and also with requesting, that the next time you
   call me "a common enemy" you would add, "of us sinecure placemen and
   pensioners!

   I am, Sir, etc., etc., etc.,

   THOMAS PAINE.
