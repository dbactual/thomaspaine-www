   Crisis III

    

   Foner's introduction:

   The third Crisis was dated April 19, 1777, the second anniversary of the
   Battle of Lexington and Concord. It was aimed primarily at the internal
   enemies of the Revolution. With those who still vacillated Paine had no
   patience. "Here is the touchstone to try men by," the revolutionary
   pamphleteer wrote. "He that is not a supporter of the independent State of
   America . . . is, in the American sense of the word, a TORY; and the
   instant that he endeavors to bring his toryism into practice, he becomes a
   TRAITOR." Tories endeavoring to secure their property by supporting the
   enemy, he suggests, should be made to fear more losing it in the event of
   an American victory. Paine proposes an "oath or affirmation" renouncing
   allegiance to the King, and pledging support to the United States. He also
   suggests that a tax of ten, fifteen, or twenty percent be levied on all
   property. All who took the oath could exempt their property by declaring
   ready to aid the Revolutionary cause whenever they were called upon. Those
   who refused to take the oath would be paying a tax on their insurance with
   the enemy. "It would not only be good policy," Paine points out, "but
   strict justice to raise fifty or one hundred thousand pounds, or more, if
   it is necessary, out of the estates and property of the King of England's
   votaries, resident in Philadelphia, to be distributed as a reward to those
   inhabitants of the city and State who should turn out and repulse the
   enemy should they attempt to march this way." Paine's proposal was
   followed in part on June 13, 1777, when Pennsylvania required an oath of
   allegiance to the State from all over eighteen years of age.

   Two days before the Crisis 111 was published (April 17, 1777), Paine had
   been appointed by Congress Secretary of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

   *************

   IN THE progress of politics, as in the common occurrences of life, we are
   not only apt to forget the ground we have travelled over, but frequently
   neglect to gather up experience as we go. We expend, if I may so say, the
   knowledge of every day on the circumstances that produce it, and journey
   on in search of new matter and new refinements: but as it is pleasant and
   sometimes useful to look back, even to the first periods of infancy, and
   trace the turns and windings through which we have passed, so we may
   likewise derive many advantages by halting a while in our political
   career, and taking a review of the wondrous complicated labyrinth of
   little more than yesterday.

   Truly may we say, that never did men grow old in so short a time! We have
   crowded the business of an age into the compass of a few months, and have
   been driven through such a rapid succession of things, that for the want
   of leisure to think, we unavoidably wasted knowledge as we came, and have
   left nearly as much behind us as we brought with us: but the road is yet
   rich with the fragments, and, before we finally lose sight of them, will
   repay us for the trouble of stopping to pick them up.

   Were a man to be totally deprived of memory, he would be incapable of
   forming any just opinion; every thing about him would seem a chaos: he
   would have even his own history to ask from every one; and by not knowing
   how the world went in his absence, he would be at a loss to know how it
   ought to go on when he recovered, or rather, returned to it again. In like
   manner, though in a less degree, a too great inattention to past
   occurrences retards and bewilders our judgment in everything; while, on
   the contrary, by comparing what is past with what is present, we
   frequently hit on the true character of both, and become wise with very
   little trouble. It is a kind of counter-march, by which we get into the
   rear of time, and mark the movements and meaning of things as we make our
   return. There are certain circumstances, which, at the time of their
   happening, are a kind of riddles, and as every riddle is to be followed by
   its answer, so those kind of circumstances will be followed by their
   events, and those events are always the true solution. A considerable
   space of time may lapse between, and unless we continue our observations
   from the one to the other, the harmony of them will pass away unnoticed:
   but the misfortune is, that partly from the pressing necessity of some
   instant things, and partly from the impatience of our own tempers, we are
   frequently in such a hurry to make out the meaning of everything as fast
   as it happens, that we thereby never truly understand it; and not only
   start new difficulties to ourselves by so doing, but, as it were,
   embarrass Providence in her good designs.

   I have been civil in stating this fault on a large scale, for, as it now
   stands, it does not appear to be levelled against any particular set of
   men; but were it to be refined a little further, it might afterwards be
   applied to the Tories with a degree of striking propriety: those men have
   been remarkable for drawing sudden conclusions from single facts. The
   least apparent mishap on our side, or the least seeming advantage on the
   part of the enemy, have determined with them the fate of a whole campaign.
   By this hasty judgment they have converted a retreat into a defeat;
   mistook generalship for error; while every little advantage purposely
   given the enemy, either to weaken their strength by dividing it, embarrass
   their councils by multiplying their objects, or to secure a greater post
   by the surrender of a less, has been instantly magnified into a conquest.
   Thus, by quartering ill policy upon ill principles, they have frequently
   promoted the cause they designed to injure, and injured that which they
   intended to promote.

   It is probable the campaign may open before this number comes from the
   press. The enemy have long lain idle, and amused themselves with carrying
   on the war by proclamations only. While they continue their delay our
   strength increases, and were they to move to action now, it is a
   circumstantial proof that they have no reinforcement coming; wherefore, in
   either case, the comparative advantage will be ours. Like a wounded,
   disabled whale, they want only time and room to die in; and though in the
   agony of their exit, it may be unsafe to live within the flapping of their
   tail, yet every hour shortens their date, and lessens their power of
   mischief. If any thing happens while this number is in the press, it will
   afford me a subject for the last pages of it. At present I am tired of
   waiting; and as neither the enemy, nor the state of politics have yet
   produced any thing new, I am thereby left in the field of general matter,
   undirected by any striking or particular object. This Crisis, therefore,
   will be made up rather of variety than novelty, and consist more of things
   useful than things wonderful.

   The success of the cause, the union of the people, and the means of
   supporting and securing both, are points which cannot be too much attended
   to. He who doubts of the former is a desponding coward, and he who
   wilfully disturbs the latter is a traitor. Their characters are easily
   fixed, and under these short descriptions I leave them for the present.

   One of the greatest degrees of sentimental union which America ever knew,
   was in denying the right of the British parliament "to bind the colonies
   in all cases whatsoever." The Declaration is, in its form, an almighty
   one, and is the loftiest stretch of arbitrary power that ever one set of
   men or one country claimed over another. Taxation was nothing more than
   the putting the declared right into practice; and this failing, recourse
   was had to arms, as a means to establish both the right and the practice,
   or to answer a worse purpose, which will be mentioned in the course of
   this number. And in order to repay themselves the expense of an army, and
   to profit by their own injustice, the colonies were, by another law,
   declared to be in a state of actual rebellion, and of consequence all
   property therein would fall to the conquerors.

   The colonies, on their part, first, denied the right; secondly, they
   suspended the use of taxable articles, and petitioned against the practice
   of taxation: and these failing, they, thirdly, defended their property by
   force, as soon as it was forcibly invaded, and, in answer to the
   declaration of rebellion and non-protection, published their Declaration
   of Independence and right of self-protection.

   These, in a few words, are the different stages of the quarrel; and the
   parts are so intimately and necessarily connected with each other as to
   admit of no separation. A person, to use a trite phrase, must be a Whig or
   a Tory in a lump. His feelings, as a man, may be wounded; his charity, as
   a Christian, may be moved; but his political principles must go through
   all the cases on one side or the other. He cannot be a Whig in this stage,
   and a Tory in that. If he says he is against the united independence of
   the continent, he is to all intents and purposes against her in all the
   rest; because this last comprehends the whole. And he may just as well
   say, that Britain was right in declaring us rebels; right in taxing us;
   and right in declaring her "right to bind the colonies in all cases
   whatsoever." It signifies nothing what neutral ground, of his own
   creating, he may skulk upon for shelter, for the quarrel in no stage of it
   hath afforded any such ground; and either we or Britain are absolutely
   right or absolutely wrong through the whole.

   Britain, like a gamester nearly ruined, has now put all her losses into
   one bet, and is playing a desperate game for the total. If she wins it,
   she wins from me my life; she wins the continent as the forfeited property
   of rebels; the right of taxing those that are left as reduced subjects;
   and the power of binding them slaves: and the single die which determines
   this unparalleled event is, whether we support our independence or she
   overturn it. This is coming to the point at once. Here is the touchstone
   to try men by. He that is not a supporter of the independent States of
   America in the same degree that his religious and political principles
   would suffer him to support the government of any other country, of which
   he called himself a subject, is, in the American sense of the word, A
   TORY; and the instant that he endeavors to bring his toryism into
   practice, he becomes A TRAITOR. The first can only be detected by a
   general test, and the law hath already provided for the latter.

   It is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who would root up our
   independence to have any share in our legislation, either as electors or
   representatives; because the support of our independence rests, in a great
   measure, on the vigor and purity of our public bodies. Would Britain, even
   in time of peace, much less in war, suffer an election to be carried by
   men who professed themselves to be not her subjects, or allow such to sit
   in Parliament? Certainly not.

   But there are a certain species of Tories with whom conscience or
   principle has nothing to do, and who are so from avarice only. Some of the
   first fortunes on the continent, on the part of the Whigs, are staked on
   the issue of our present measures. And shall disaffection only be rewarded
   with security? Can any thing be a greater inducement to a miserly man,
   than the hope of making his Mammon safe? And though the scheme be fraught
   with every character of folly, yet, so long as he supposes, that by doing
   nothing materially criminal against America on one part, and by expressing
   his private disapprobation against independence, as palliative with the
   enemy, on the other part, he stands in a safe line between both; while, I
   say, this ground be suffered to remain, craft, and the spirit of avarice,
   will point it out, and men will not be wanting to fill up this most
   contemptible of all characters.

   These men, ashamed to own the sordid cause from whence their disaffection
   springs, add thereby meanness to meanness, by endeavoring to shelter
   themselves under the mask of hypocrisy; that is, they had rather be
   thought to be Tories from some kind of principle, than Tories by having no
   principle at all. But till such time as they can show some real reason,
   natural, political, or conscientious, on which their objections to
   independence are founded, we are not obliged to give them credit for being
   Tories of the first stamp, but must set them down as Tories of the last.

   In the second number of the Crisis, I endeavored to show the impossibility
   of the enemy's making any conquest of America, that nothing was wanting on
   our part but patience and perseverance, and that, with these virtues, our
   success, as far as human speculation could discern, seemed as certain as
   fate. But as there are many among us, who, influenced by others, have
   regularly gone back from the principles they once held, in proportion as
   we have gone forward; and as it is the unfortunate lot of many a good man
   to live within the neighborhood of disaffected ones; I shall, therefore,
   for the sake of confirming the one and recovering the other, endeavor, in
   the space of a page or two, to go over some of the leading principles in
   support of independence. It is a much pleasanter task to prevent vice than
   to punish it, and, however our tempers may be gratified by resentment, or
   our national expenses eased by forfeited estates, harmony and friendship
   is, nevertheless, the happiest condition a country can be blessed with.

   The principal arguments in support of independence may be comprehended
   under the four following heads.

   1st, The natural right of the continent to independence.

   2d, Her interest in being independent.

   3d, The necessity,- and

   4th, The moral advantages arising therefrom.

   I. The natural right of the continent to independence, is a point which
   never yet was called in question. It will not even admit of a debate. To
   deny such a right, would be a kind of atheism against nature: and the best
   answer to such an objection would be, "The fool hath said in his heart
   there is no God."

   II. The interest of the continent in being independent is a point as
   clearly right as the former. America, by her own internal industry, and
   unknown to all the powers of Europe, was, at the beginning of the dispute,
   arrived at a pitch of greatness, trade and population, beyond which it was
   the interest of Britain not to suffer her to pass, lest she should grow
   too powerful to be kept subordinate. She began to view this country with
   the same uneasy malicious eye, with which a covetous guardian would view
   his ward, whose estate he had been enriching himself by for twenty years,
   and saw him just arriving at manhood. And America owes no more to Britain
   for her present maturity, than the ward would to the guardian for being
   twenty-one years of age. That America hath flourished at the time she was
   under the government of Britain, is true; but there is every natural
   reason to believe, that had she been an independent country from the first
   settlement thereof, uncontrolled by any foreign power, free to make her
   own laws, regulate and encourage her own commerce, she had by this time
   been of much greater worth than now. The case is simply this: the first
   settlers in the different colonies were left to shift for themselves,
   unnoticed and unsupported by any European government; but as the tyranny
   and persecution of the old world daily drove numbers to the new, and as,
   by the favor of heaven on their industry and perseverance, they grew into
   importance, so, in a like degree, they became an object of profit to the
   greedy eyes of Europe. It was impossible, in this state of infancy,
   however thriving and promising, that they could resist the power of any
   armed invader that should seek to bring them under his authority. In this
   situation, Britain thought it worth her while to claim them, and the
   continent received and acknowledged the claimer. It was, in reality, of no
   very great importance who was her master, seeing, that from the force and
   ambition of the different powers of Europe, she must, till she acquired
   strength enough to assert her own right, acknowledge some one. As well,
   perhaps, Britain as another; and it might have been as well to have been
   under the states of Holland as any. The same hopes of engrossing and
   profiting by her trade, by not oppressing it too much, would have operated
   alike with any master, and produced to the colonies the same effects. The
   clamor of protection, likewise, was all a farce; because, in order to make
   that protection necessary, she must first, by her own quarrels, create us
   enemies. Hard terms indeed!

   To know whether it be the interest of the continent to be independent, we
   need only ask this easy, simple question: Is it the interest of a man to
   be a boy all his life? The answer to one will be the answer to both.
   America hath been one continued scene of legislative contention from the
   first king's representative to the last; and this was unavoidably founded
   in the natural opposition of interest between the old country and the new.
   A governor sent from England, or receiving his authority therefrom, ought
   never to have been considered in any other light than that of a genteel
   commissioned spy, whose private business was information, and his public
   business a kind of civilized oppression. In the first of these characters
   he was to watch the tempers, sentiments, and disposition of the people,
   the growth of trade, and the increase of private fortunes; and, in the
   latter, to suppress all such acts of the assemblies, however beneficial to
   the people, which did not directly or indirectly throw some increase of
   power or profit into the hands of those that sent him.

   America, till now, could never be called a free country, because her
   legislation depended on the will of a man three thousand miles distant,
   whose interest was in opposition to ours, and who, by a single "no," could
   forbid what law he pleased.

   The freedom of trade, likewise, is, to a trading country, an article of
   such importance, that the principal source of wealth depends upon it; and
   it is impossible that any country can flourish, as it otherwise might do,
   whose commerce is engrossed, cramped and fettered by the laws and mandates
   of another- yet these evils, and more than I can here enumerate, the
   continent has suffered by being under the government of England. By an
   independence we clear the whole at once- put an end to the business of
   unanswered petitions and fruitless remonstrances- exchange Britain for
   Europe- shake hands with the world- live at peace with the world- and
   trade to any market where we can buy and sell.

   III. The necessity, likewise, of being independent, even before it was
   declared, became so evident and important, that the continent ran the risk
   of being ruined every day that she delayed it. There was reason to believe
   that Britain would endeavor to make an European matter of it, and, rather
   than lose the whole, would dismember it, like Poland, and dispose of her
   several claims to the highest bidder. Genoa, failing in her attempts to
   reduce Corsica, made a sale of it to the French, and such trafficks have
   been common in the old world. We had at that time no ambassador in any
   part of Europe, to counteract her negotiations, and by that means she had
   the range of every foreign court uncontradicted on our part. We even knew
   nothing of the treaty for the Hessians till it was concluded, and the
   troops ready to embark. Had we been independent before, we had probably
   prevented her obtaining them. We had no credit abroad, because of our
   rebellious dependency. Our ships could claim no protection in foreign
   ports, because we afforded them no justifiable reason for granting it to
   us. The calling ourselves subjects, and at the same time fighting against
   the power which we acknowledged, was a dangerous precedent to all Europe.
   If the grievances justified the taking up arms, they justified our
   separation; if they did not justify our separation, neither could they
   justify our taking up arms. All Europe was interested in reducing us as
   rebels, and all Europe (or the greatest part at least) is interested in
   supporting us as independent States. At home our condition was still
   worse: our currency had no foundation, and the fall of it would have
   ruined Whig and Tory alike. We had no other law than a kind of moderated
   passion; no other civil power than an honest mob; and no other protection
   than the temporary attachment of one man to another. Had independence been
   delayed a few months longer, this continent would have been plunged into
   irrecoverable confusion: some violent for it, some against it, till, in
   the general cabal, the rich would have been ruined, and the poor
   destroyed. It is to independence that every Tory owes the present safety
   which he lives in; for by that, and that only, we emerged from a state of
   dangerous suspense, and became a regular people.

   The necessity, likewise, of being independent, had there been no rupture
   between Britain and America, would, in a little time, have brought one on.
   The increasing importance of commerce, the weight and perplexity of
   legislation, and the entangled state of European politics, would daily
   have shown to the continent the impossibility of continuing subordinate;
   for, after the coolest reflections on the matter, this must be allowed,
   that Britain was too jealous of America to govern it justly; too ignorant
   of it to govern it well; and too far distant from it to govern it at all.

   IV. But what weigh most with all men of serious reflection are, the moral
   advantages arising from independence: war and desolation have become the
   trade of the old world; and America neither could nor can be under the
   government of Britain without becoming a sharer of her guilt, and a
   partner in all the dismal commerce of death. The spirit of duelling,
   extended on a national scale, is a proper character for European wars.
   They have seldom any other motive than pride, or any other object than
   fame. The conquerors and the conquered are generally ruined alike, and the
   chief difference at last is, that the one marches home with his honors,
   and the other without them. 'Tis the natural temper of the English to
   fight for a feather, if they suppose that feather to be an affront; and
   America, without the right of asking why, must have abetted in every
   quarrel, and abided by its fate. It is a shocking situation to live in,
   that one country must be brought into all the wars of another, whether the
   measure be right or wrong, or whether she will or not; yet this, in the
   fullest extent, was, and ever would be, the unavoidable consequence of the
   connection. Surely the Quakers forgot their own principles when, in their
   late Testimony, they called this connection, with these military and
   miserable appendages hanging to it- "the happy constitution."

   Britain, for centuries past, has been nearly fifty years out of every
   hundred at war with some power or other. It certainly ought to be a
   conscientious as well political consideration with America, not to dip her
   hands in the bloody work of Europe. Our situation affords us a retreat
   from their cabals, and the present happy union of the states bids fair for
   extirpating the future use of arms from one quarter of the world; yet such
   have been the irreligious politics of the present leaders of the Quakers,
   that, for the sake of they scarce know what, they would cut off every hope
   of such a blessing by tying this continent to Britain, like Hector to the
   chariot wheel of Achilles, to be dragged through all the miseries of
   endless European wars.

   The connection, viewed from this ground, is distressing to every man who
   has the feelings of humanity. By having Britain for our master, we became
   enemies to the greatest part of Europe, and they to us: and the
   consequence was war inevitable. By being our own masters, independent of
   any foreign one, we have Europe for our friends, and the prospect of an
   endless peace among ourselves. Those who were advocates for the British
   government over these colonies, were obliged to limit both their arguments
   and their ideas to the period of an European peace only; the moment
   Britain became plunged in war, every supposed convenience to us vanished,
   and all we could hope for was not to be ruined. Could this be a desirable
   condition for a young country to be in?

   Had the French pursued their fortune immediately after the defeat of
   Braddock last war, this city and province had then experienced the woeful
   calamities of being a British subject. A scene of the same kind might
   happen again; for America, considered as a subject to the crown of
   Britain, would ever have been the seat of war, and the bone of contention
   between the two powers.

   On the whole, if the future expulsion of arms from one quarter of the
   world would be a desirable object to a peaceable man; if the freedom of
   trade to every part of it can engage the attention of a man of business;
   if the support or fall of millions of currency can affect our interests;
   if the entire possession of estates, by cutting off the lordly claims of
   Britain over the soil, deserves the regard of landed property; and if the
   right of making our own laws, uncontrolled by royal or ministerial spies
   or mandates, be worthy our care as freemen;- then are all men interested
   in the support of independence; and may he that supports it not, be driven
   from the blessing, and live unpitied beneath the servile sufferings of
   scandalous subjection!

   We have been amused with the tales of ancient wonders; we have read, and
   wept over the histories of other nations: applauded, censured, or pitied,
   as their cases affected us. The fortitude and patience of the sufferers-
   the justness of their cause- the weight of their oppressions and
   oppressors- the object to be saved or lost- with all the consequences of a
   defeat or a conquest- have, in the hour of sympathy, bewitched our hearts,
   and chained it to their fate: but where is the power that ever made war
   upon petitioners? Or where is the war on which a world was staked till
   now?

   We may not, perhaps, be wise enough to make all the advantages we ought of
   our independence; but they are, nevertheless, marked and presented to us
   with every character of great and good, and worthy the hand of him who
   sent them. I look through the present trouble to a time of tranquillity,
   when we shall have it in our power to set an example of peace to all the
   world. Were the Quakers really impressed and influenced by the quiet
   principles they profess to hold, they would, however they might disapprove
   the means, be the first of all men to approve of independence, because, by
   separating ourselves from the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, it affords an
   opportunity never given to man before of carrying their favourite
   principle of peace into general practice, by establishing governments that
   shall hereafter exist without wars. O! ye fallen, cringing,
   priest-and-Pemberton-ridden people! What more can we say of ye than that a
   religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a political Quaker a real
   Jesuit.

   Having thus gone over some of the principal points in support of
   independence, I must now request the reader to return back with me to the
   period when it first began to be a public doctrine, and to examine the
   progress it has made among the various classes of men. The area I mean to
   begin at, is the breaking out of hostilities, April 19th, 1775. Until this
   event happened, the continent seemed to view the dispute as a kind of
   law-suit for a matter of right, litigating between the old country and the
   new; and she felt the same kind and degree of horror, as if she had seen
   an oppressive plaintiff, at the head of a band of ruffians, enter the
   court, while the cause was before it, and put the judge, the jury, the
   defendant and his counsel, to the sword. Perhaps a more heart-felt
   convulsion never reached a country with the same degree of power and
   rapidity before, and never may again. Pity for the sufferers, mixed with
   indignation at the violence, and heightened with apprehensions of
   undergoing the same fate, made the affair of Lexington the affair of the
   continent. Every part of it felt the shock, and all vibrated together. A
   general promotion of sentiment took place: those who had drank deeply into
   Whiggish principles, that is, the right and necessity not only of
   opposing, but wholly setting aside the power of the crown as soon as it
   became practically dangerous (for in theory it was always so), stepped
   into the first stage of independence; while another class of Whigs,
   equally sound in principle, but not so sanguine in enterprise, attached
   themselves the stronger to the cause, and fell close in with the rear of
   the former; their partition was a mere point. Numbers of the moderate men,
   whose chief fault, at that time, arose from entertaining a better opinion
   of Britain than she deserved, convinced now of their mistake, gave her up,
   and publicly declared themselves good Whigs. While the Tories, seeing it
   was no longer a laughing matter, either sank into silent obscurity, or
   contented themselves with coming forth and abusing General Gage: not a
   single advocate appeared to justify the action of that day; it seemed to
   appear to every one with the same magnitude, struck every one with the
   same force, and created in every one the same abhorrence. From this period
   we may date the growth of independence.

   If the many circumstances which happened at this memorable time, be taken
   in one view, and compared with each other, they will justify a conclusion
   which seems not to have been attended to, I mean a fixed design in the
   king and ministry of driving America into arms, in order that they might
   be furnished with a pretence for seizing the whole continent, as the
   immediate property of the crown. A noble plunder for hungry courtiers!

   It ought to be remembered, that the first petition from the Congress was
   at this time unanswered on the part of the British king. That the motion,
   called Lord North's motion, of the 20th of February, 1775, arrived in
   America the latter end of March. This motion was to be laid, by the
   several governors then in being, before, the assembly of each province;
   and the first assembly before which it was laid, was the assembly of
   Pennsylvania, in May following. This being a just state of the case, I
   then ask, why were hostilities commenced between the time of passing the
   resolve in the House of Commons, of the 20th of February, and the time of
   the assemblies meeting to deliberate upon it? Degrading and famous as that
   motion was, there is nevertheless reason to believe that the king and his
   adherents were afraid the colonies would agree to it, and lest they
   should, took effectual care they should not, by provoking them with
   hostilities in the interim. They had not the least doubt at that time of
   conquering America at one blow; and what they expected to get by a
   conquest being infinitely greater than any thing they could hope to get
   either by taxation or accommodation, they seemed determined to prevent
   even the possibility of hearing each other, lest America should disappoint
   their greedy hopes of the whole, by listening even to their own terms. On
   the one hand they refused to hear the petition of the continent, and on
   the other hand took effectual care the continent should not hear them.

   That the motion of the 20th February and the orders for commencing
   hostilities were both concerted by the same person or persons, and not the
   latter by General Gage, as was falsely imagined at first, is evident from
   an extract of a letter of his to the administration, read among other
   papers in the House of Commons; in which he informs his masters, "That
   though their idea of his disarming certain counties was a right one, yet
   it required him to be master of the country, in order to enable him to
   execute it." This was prior to the commencement of hostilities, and
   consequently before the motion of the 20th February could be deliberated
   on by the several assemblies.

   Perhaps it may be asked, why was the motion passed, if there was at the
   same time a plan to aggravate the Americans not to listen to it? Lord
   North assigned one reason himself, which was a hope of dividing them. This
   was publicly tempting them to reject it; that if, in case the injury of
   arms should fail in provoking them sufficiently, the insult of such a
   declaration might fill it up. But by passing the motion and getting it
   afterwards rejected in America, it enabled them, in their wicked idea of
   politics, among other things, to hold up the colonies to foreign powers,
   with every possible mark of disobedience and rebellion. They had applied
   to those powers not to supply the continent with arms, ammunition, etc.,
   and it was necessary they should incense them against us, by assigning on
   their own part some seeming reputable reason why. By dividing, it had a
   tendency to weaken the States, and likewise to perplex the adherents of
   America in England. But the principal scheme, and that which has marked
   their character in every part of their conduct, was a design of
   precipitating the colonies into a state which they might afterwards deem
   rebellion, and, under that pretence, put an end to all future complaints,
   petitions and remonstrances, by seizing the whole at once. They had
   ravaged one part of the globe, till it could glut them no longer; their
   prodigality required new plunder, and through the East India article tea
   they hoped to transfer their rapine from that quarter of the world to
   this. Every designed quarrel had its pretence; and the same barbarian
   avarice accompanied the plant to America, which ruined the country that
   produced it.

   That men never turn rogues without turning fools is a maxim, sooner or
   later, universally true. The commencement of hostilities, being in the
   beginning of April, was, of all times the worst chosen: the Congress were
   to meet the tenth of May following, and the distress the continent felt at
   this unparalleled outrage gave a stability to that body which no other
   circumstance could have done. It suppressed too all inferior debates, and
   bound them together by a necessitous affection, without giving them time
   to differ upon trifles. The suffering likewise softened the whole body of
   the people into a degree of pliability, which laid the principal
   foundation-stone of union, order, and government; and which, at any other
   time, might only have fretted and then faded away unnoticed and
   unimproved. But Providence, who best knows how to time her misfortunes as
   well as her immediate favors, chose this to be the time, and who dare
   dispute it?

   It did not seem the disposition of the people, at this crisis, to heap
   petition upon petition, while the former remained unanswered. The measure
   however was carried in Congress, and a second petition was sent; of which
   I shall only remark that it was submissive even to a dangerous fault,
   because the prayer of it appealed solely to what it called the prerogative
   of the crown, while the matter in dispute was confessedly constitutional.
   But even this petition, flattering as it was, was still not so harmonious
   as the chink of cash, and consequently not sufficiently grateful to the
   tyrant and his ministry. From every circumstance it is evident, that it
   was the determination of the British court to have nothing to do with
   America but to conquer her fully and absolutely. They were certain of
   success, and the field of battle was the only place of treaty. I am
   confident there are thousands and tens of thousands in America who wonder
   now that they should ever have thought otherwise; but the sin of that day
   was the sin of civility; yet it operated against our present good in the
   same manner that a civil opinion of the devil would against our future
   peace.

   Independence was a doctrine scarce and rare, even towards the conclusion
   of the year 1775; all our politics had been founded on the hope of
   expectation of making the matter up- a hope, which, though general on the
   side of America, had never entered the head or heart of the British court.
   Their hope was conquest and confiscation. Good heavens! what volumes of
   thanks does America owe to Britain? What infinite obligation to the tool
   that fills, with paradoxical vacancy, the throne! Nothing but the sharpest
   essence of villany, compounded with the strongest distillation of folly,
   could have produced a menstruum that would have effected a separation. The
   Congress in 1774 administered an abortive medicine to independence, by
   prohibiting the importation of goods, and the succeeding Congress rendered
   the dose still more dangerous by continuing it. Had independence been a
   settled system with America, (as Britain has advanced,) she ought to have
   doubled her importation, and prohibited in some degree her exportation.
   And this single circumstance is sufficient to acquit America before any
   jury of nations, of having a continental plan of independence in view; a
   charge which, had it been true, would have been honorable, but is so
   grossly false, that either the amazing ignorance or the wilful dishonesty
   of the British court is effectually proved by it.

   The second petition, like the first, produced no answer; it was scarcely
   acknowledged to have been received; the British court were too determined
   in their villainy even to act it artfully, and in their rage for conquest
   neglected the necessary subtleties for obtaining it. They might have
   divided, distracted and played a thousand tricks with us, had they been as
   cunning as they were cruel.

   This last indignity gave a new spring to independence. Those who knew the
   savage obstinacy of the king, and the jobbing, gambling spirit of the
   court, predicted the fate of the petition, as soon as it was sent from
   America; for the men being known, their measures were easily foreseen. As
   politicians we ought not so much to ground our hopes on the reasonableness
   of the thing we ask, as on the reasonableness of the person of whom we ask
   it: who would expect discretion from a fool, candor from a tyrant, or
   justice from a villain?

   As every prospect of accommodation seemed now to fail fast, men began to
   think seriously on the matter; and their reason being thus stripped of the
   false hope which had long encompassed it, became approachable by fair
   debate: yet still the bulk of the people hesitated; they startled at the
   novelty of independence, without once considering that our getting into
   arms at first was a more extraordinary novelty, and that all other nations
   had gone through the work of independence before us. They doubted likewise
   the ability of the continent to support it, without reflecting that it
   required the same force to obtain an accommodation by arms as an
   independence. If the one was acquirable, the other was the same; because,
   to accomplish either, it was necessary that our strength should be too
   great for Britain to subdue; and it was too unreasonable to suppose, that
   with the power of being masters, we should submit to be servants.* Their
   caution at this time was exceedingly misplaced; for if they were able to
   defend their property and maintain their rights by arms, they,
   consequently, were able to defend and support their independence; and in
   proportion as these men saw the necessity and correctness of the measure,
   they honestly and openly declared and adopted it, and the part that they
   had acted since has done them honor and fully established their
   characters. Error in opinion has this peculiar advantage with it, that the
   foremost point of the contrary ground may at any time be reached by the
   sudden exertion of a thought; and it frequently happens in sentimental
   differences, that some striking circumstance, or some forcible reason
   quickly conceived, will effect in an instant what neither argument nor
   example could produce in an age.

      * In this state of political suspense the pamphlet Common Sense made its
      appearance, and the success it met with does not become me to mention. Dr.
      Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams, were severally spoken of as the
      supposed author. I had not, at that time, the pleasure either of
      personally knowing or being known to the two last gentlemen. The favor of
      Dr. Franklin's friendship I possessed in England, and my introduction to
      this part of the world was through his patronage. I happened, when a
      school-boy, to pick up a pleasing natural history of Virginia, and my
      inclination from that day of seeing the western side of the Atlantic never
      left me. In October, 1775, Dr. Franklin proposed giving me such materials
      as were in his hands, towards completing a history of the present
      transactions, and seemed desirous of having the first volume out the next
      Spring. I had then formed the outlines of Common Sense, and finished
      nearly the first part; and as I supposed the doctor's design in getting
      out a history was to open the new year with a new system, I expected to
      surprise him with a production on that subject, much earlier than he
      thought of; and without informing him what I was doing, got it ready for
      the press as fast as I conveniently could, and sent him the first pamphlet
      that was printed off.- Author

   I find it impossible in the small compass I am limited to, to trace out
   the progress which independence has made on the minds of the different
   classes of men, and the several reasons by which they were moved. With
   some, it was a passionate abhorrence against the king of England and his
   ministry, as a set of savages and brutes; and these men, governed by the
   agony of a wounded mind, were for trusting every thing to hope and heaven,
   and bidding defiance at once. With others, it was a growing conviction
   that the scheme of the British court was to create, ferment and drive on a
   quarrel, for the sake of confiscated plunder: and men of this class
   ripened into independence in proportion as the evidence increased. While a
   third class conceived it was the true interest of America, internally and
   externally, to be her own master, and gave their support to independence,
   step by step, as they saw her abilities to maintain it enlarge. With many,
   it was a compound of all these reasons; while those who were too callous
   to be reached by either, remained, and still remain Tories.

   The legal necessity of being independent, with several collateral reasons,
   is pointed out in an elegant masterly manner, in a charge to the grand
   jury for the district of Charleston, by the Hon. William Henry Drayton,
   chief justice of South Carolina, [April 23, 1776]. This performance, and
   the address of the convention of New York, are pieces, in my humble
   opinion, of the first rank in America.

   The principal causes why independence has not been so universally
   supported as it ought, are fear and indolence, and the causes why it has
   been opposed, are, avarice, down-right villany, and lust of personal
   power. There is not such a being in America as a Tory from conscience;
   some secret defect or other is interwoven in the character of all those,
   be they men or women, who can look with patience on the brutality, luxury
   and debauchery of the British court, and the violations of their army
   here. A woman's virtue must sit very lightly on her who can even hint a
   favorable sentiment in their behalf. It is remarkable that the whole race
   of prostitutes in New York were tories; and the schemes for supporting the
   Tory cause in this city, for which several are now in jail, and one
   hanged, were concerted and carried on in common bawdy-houses, assisted by
   those who kept them.

   The connection between vice and meanness is a fit subject for satire, but
   when the satire is a fact, it cuts with the irresistible power of a
   diamond. If a Quaker, in defence of his just rights, his property, and the
   chastity of his house, takes up a musket, he is expelled the meeting; but
   the present king of England, who seduced and took into keeping a sister of
   their society, is reverenced and supported by repeated Testimonies, while,
   the friendly noodle from whom she was taken (and who is now in this city)
   continues a drudge in the service of his rival, as if proud of being
   cuckolded by a creature called a king.

   Our support and success depend on such a variety of men and circumstances,
   that every one who does but wish well, is of some use: there are men who
   have a strange aversion to arms, yet have hearts to risk every shilling in
   the cause, or in support of those who have better talents for defending
   it. Nature, in the arrangement of mankind, has fitted some for every
   service in life: were all soldiers, all would starve and go naked, and
   were none soldiers, all would be slaves. As disaffection to independence
   is the badge of a Tory, so affection to it is the mark of a Whig; and the
   different services of the Whigs, down from those who nobly contribute
   every thing, to those who have nothing to render but their wishes, tend
   all to the same center, though with different degrees of merit and
   ability. The larger we make the circle, the more we shall harmonize, and
   the stronger we shall be. All we want to shut out is disaffection, and,
   that excluded, we must accept from each other such duties as we are best
   fitted to bestow. A narrow system of politics, like a narrow system of
   religion, is calculated only to sour the temper, and be at variance with
   mankind.

   All we want to know in America is simply this, who is for independence,
   and who is not? Those who are for it, will support it, and the remainder
   will undoubtedly see the reasonableness of paying the charges; while those
   who oppose or seek to betray it, must expect the more rigid fate of the
   jail and the gibbet. There is a bastard kind of generosity, which being
   extended to all men, is as fatal to society, on one hand, as the want of
   true generosity is on the other. A lax manner of administering justice,
   falsely termed moderation, has a tendency both to dispirit public virtue,
   and promote the growth of public evils. Had the late committee of safety
   taken cognizance of the last Testimony of the Quakers and proceeded
   against such delinquents as were concerned therein, they had, probably,
   prevented the treasonable plans which have been concerted since. When one
   villain is suffered to escape, it encourages another to proceed, either
   from a hope of escaping likewise, or an apprehension that we dare not
   punish. It has been a matter of general surprise, that no notice was taken
   of the incendiary publication of the Quakers, of the 20th of November
   last; a publication evidently intended to promote sedition and treason,
   and encourage the enemy, who were then within a day's march of this city,
   to proceed on and possess it. I here present the reader with a memorial
   which was laid before the board of safety a few days after the Testimony
   appeared. Not a member of that board, that I conversed with, but expressed
   the highest detestation of the perverted principles and conduct of the
   Quaker junto, and a wish that the board would take the matter up;
   notwithstanding which, it was suffered to pass away unnoticed, to the
   encouragement of new acts of treason, the general danger of the cause, and
   the disgrace of the state.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To the honorable the Council of Safety of the State of
    Pennsylvania.

   At a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabitants of the city of
   Philadelphia, impressed with a proper sense of the justice of the cause
   which this continent is engaged in, and animated with a generous fervor
   for supporting the same, it was resolved, that the following be laid
   before the board of safety:

   "We profess liberality of sentiment to all men; with this distinction
   only, that those who do not deserve it would become wise and seek to
   deserve it. We hold the pure doctrines of universal liberty of conscience,
   and conceive it our duty to endeavor to secure that sacred right to
   others, as well as to defend it for ourselves; for we undertake not to
   judge of the religious rectitude of tenets, but leave the whole matter to
   Him who made us.

   "We persecute no man, neither will we abet in the persecution of any man
   for religion's sake; our common relation to others being that of
   fellow-citizens and fellow-subjects of one single community; and in this
   line of connection we hold out the right hand of fellowship to all men.
   But we should conceive ourselves to be unworthy members of the free and
   independent States of America, were we unconcernedly to see or to suffer
   any treasonable wound, public or private, directly or indirectly, to be
   given against the peace and safety of the same. We inquire not into the
   rank of the offenders, nor into their religious persuasion; we have no
   business with either, our part being only to find them out and exhibit
   them to justice.

   "A printed paper, dated the 20th of November, and signed 'John Pemberton,'
   whom we suppose to be an inhabitant of this city, has lately been
   dispersed abroad, a copy of which accompanies this. Had the framers and
   publishers of that paper conceived it their duty to exhort the youth and
   others of their society, to a patient submission under the present trying
   visitations, and humbly to wait the event of heaven towards them, they had
   therein shown a Christian temper, and we had been silent; but the anger
   and political virulence with which their instructions are given, and the
   abuse with which they stigmatize all ranks of men not thinking like
   themselves, leave no doubt on our minds from what spirit their publication
   proceeded: and it is disgraceful to the pure cause of truth, that men can
   dally with words of the most sacred import, and play them off as
   mechanically as if religion consisted only in contrivance. We know of no
   instance in which the Quakers have been compelled to bear arms, or to do
   any thing which might strain their conscience; wherefore their advice, 'to
   withstand and refuse to submit to the arbitrary instructions and
   ordinances of men,' appear to us a false alarm, and could only be
   treasonably calculated to gain favor with our enemies, when they are
   seemingly on the brink of invading this State, or, what is still worse, to
   weaken the hands of our defence, that their entrance into this city might
   be made practicable and easy.

   "We disclaim all tumult and disorder in the punishment of offenders; and
   wish to be governed, not by temper but by reason, in the manner of
   treating them. We are sensible that our cause has suffered by the two
   following errors: first, by ill-judged lenity to traitorous persons in
   some cases; and, secondly, by only a passionate treatment of them in
   others. For the future we disown both, and wish to be steady in our
   proceedings, and serious in our punishments.

   "Every State in America has, by the repeated voice of its inhabitants,
   directed and authorized the Continental Congress to publish a formal
   Declaration of Independence of, and separation from, the oppressive king
   and Parliament of Great Britain; and we look on every man as an enemy, who
   does not in some line or other, give his assistance towards supporting the
   same; at the same time we consider the offence to be heightened to a
   degree of unpardonable guilt, when such persons, under the show of
   religion, endeavor, either by writing, speaking, or otherwise, to subvert,
   overturn, or bring reproach upon the independence of this continent as
   declared by Congress.

   "The publishers of the paper signed 'John Pemberton,' have called in a
   loud manner to their friends and connections, 'to withstand or refuse'
   obedience to whatever 'instructions or ordinances' may be published, not
   warranted by (what they call) 'that happy Constitution under which they
   and others long enjoyed tranquillity and peace.' If this be not treason,
   we know not what may properly be called by that name.

   "To us it is a matter of surprise and astonishment, that men with the word
   'peace, peace,' continually on their lips, should be so fond of living
   under and supporting a government, and at the same time calling it
   'happy,' which is never better pleased than when a war- that has filled
   India with carnage and famine, Africa with slavery, and tampered with
   Indians and negroes to cut the throats of the freemen of America. We
   conceive it a disgrace to this State, to harbor or wink at such palpable
   hypocrisy. But as we seek not to hurt the hair of any man's head, when we
   can make ourselves safe without, we wish such persons to restore peace to
   themselves and us, by removing themselves to some part of the king of
   Great Britain's dominions, as by that means they may live unmolested by us
   and we by them; for our fixed opinion is, that those who do not deserve a
   place among us, ought not to have one.

   "We conclude with requesting the Council of Safety to take into
   consideration the paper signed 'John Pemberton,' and if it shall appear to
   them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a treasonable nature, that they
   would commit the signer, together with such other persons as they can
   discover were concerned therein, into custody, until such time as some
   mode of trial shall ascertain the full degree of their guilt and
   punishment; in the doing of which, we wish their judges, whoever they may
   be, to disregard the man, his connections, interest, riches, poverty, or
   principles of religion, and to attend to the nature of his offence only."

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The most cavilling sectarian cannot accuse the foregoing with containing
   the least ingredient of persecution. The free spirit on which the American
   cause is founded, disdains to mix with such an impurity, and leaves it as
   rubbish fit only for narrow and suspicious minds to grovel in. Suspicion
   and persecution are weeds of the same dunghill, and flourish together. Had
   the Quakers minded their religion and their business, they might have
   lived through this dispute in enviable ease, and none would have molested
   them. The common phrase with these people is, 'Our principles are peace.'
   To which may be replied, and your practices are the reverse; for never did
   the conduct of men oppose their own doctrine more notoriously than the
   present race of the Quakers. They have artfully changed themselves into a
   different sort of people to what they used to be, and yet have the address
   to persuade each other that they are not altered; like antiquated virgins,
   they see not the havoc deformity has made upon them, but pleasantly
   mistaking wrinkles for dimples, conceive themselves yet lovely and wonder
   at the stupid world for not admiring them.

   Did no injury arise to the public by this apostacy of the Quakers from
   themselves, the public would have nothing to do with it; but as both the
   design and consequences are pointed against a cause in which the whole
   community are interested, it is therefore no longer a subject confined to
   the cognizance of the meeting only, but comes, as a matter of criminality,
   before the authority either of the particular State in which it is acted,
   or of the continent against which it operates. Every attempt, now, to
   support the authority of the king and Parliament of Great Britain over
   America, is treason against every State; therefore it is impossible that
   any one can pardon or screen from punishment an offender against all.

   But to proceed: while the infatuated Tories of this and other States were
   last spring talking of commissioners, accommodation, making the matter up,
   and the Lord knows what stuff and nonsense, their good king and ministry
   were glutting themselves with the revenge of reducing America to
   unconditional submission, and solacing each other with the certainty of
   conquering it in one campaign. The following quotations are from the
   parliamentary register of the debate's of the House of Lords, March 5th,
   1776:

   "The Americans," says Lord Talbot,* "have been obstinate, undutiful, and
   ungovernable from the very beginning, from their first early and infant
   settlements; and I am every day more and more convinced that this people
   never will be brought back to their duty, and the subordinate relation
   they stand in to this country, till reduced to unconditional, effectual
   submission; no concession on our part, no lenity, no endurance, will have
   any other effect but that of increasing their insolence."

      * Steward of the king's household.

   "The struggle," says Lord Townsend,* "is now a struggle for power; the die
   is cast, and the only point which now remains to be determined is, in what
   manner the war can be most effectually prosecuted and speedily finished,
   in order to procure that unconditional submission, which has been so ably
   stated by the noble Earl with the white staff" (meaning Lord Talbot;) "and
   I have no reason to doubt that the measures now pursuing will put an end
   to the war in the course of a single campaign. Should it linger longer, we
   shall then have reason to expect that some foreign power will interfere,
   and take advantage of our domestic troubles and civil distractions."

      * Formerly General Townsend, at Quebec, and late lord-lieutenant of
      Ireland.

   Lord Littleton. "My sentiments are pretty well known. I shall only observe
   now that lenient measures have had no other effect than to produce insult
   after insult; that the more we conceded, the higher America rose in her
   demands, and the more insolent she has grown. It is for this reason that I
   am now for the most effective and decisive measures; and am of opinion
   that no alternative is left us, but to relinquish America for ever, or
   finally determine to compel her to acknowledge the legislative authority
   of this country; and it is the principle of an unconditional submission I
   would be for maintaining."

   Can words be more expressive than these? Surely the Tories will believe
   the Tory lords! The truth is, they do believe them and know as fully as
   any Whig on the continent knows, that the king and ministry never had the
   least design of an accommodation with America, but an absolute,
   unconditional conquest. And the part which the Tories were to act, was, by
   downright lying, to endeavor to put the continent off its guard, and to
   divide and sow discontent in the minds of such Whigs as they might gain an
   influence over. In short, to keep up a distraction here, that the force
   sent from England might be able to conquer in "one campaign." They and the
   ministry were, by a different game, playing into each other's hands. The
   cry of the Tories in England was, "No reconciliation, no accommodation,"
   in order to obtain the greater military force; while those in America were
   crying nothing but "reconciliation and accommodation," that the force sent
   might conquer with the less resistance.

   But this "single campaign" is over, and America not conquered. The whole
   work is yet to do, and the force much less to do it with. Their condition
   is both despicable and deplorable: out of cash- out of heart, and out of
   hope. A country furnished with arms and ammunition as America now is, with
   three millions of inhabitants, and three thousand miles distant from the
   nearest enemy that can approach her, is able to look and laugh them in the
   face.

   Howe appears to have two objects in view, either to go up the North River,
   or come to Philadelphia.

   By going up the North River, he secures a retreat for his army through
   Canada, but the ships must return if they return at all, the same way they
   went; as our army would be in the rear, the safety of their passage down
   is a doubtful matter. By such a motion he shuts himself from all supplies
   from Europe, but through Canada, and exposes his army and navy to the
   danger of perishing. The idea of his cutting off the communication between
   the eastern and southern states, by means of the North River, is merely
   visionary. He cannot do it by his shipping; because no ship can lay long
   at anchor in any river within reach of the shore; a single gun would drive
   a first rate from such a station. This was fully proved last October at
   Forts Washington and Lee, where one gun only, on each side of the river,
   obliged two frigates to cut and be towed off in an hour's time. Neither
   can he cut it off by his army; because the several posts they must occupy
   would divide them almost to nothing, and expose them to be picked up by
   ours like pebbles on a river's bank; but admitting that he could, where is
   the injury? Because, while his whole force is cantoned out, as sentries
   over the water, they will be very innocently employed, and the moment they
   march into the country the communication opens.

   The most probable object is Philadelphia, and the reasons are many. Howe's
   business is to conquer it, and in proportion as he finds himself unable to
   the task, he will employ his strength to distress women and weak minds, in
   order to accomplish through their fears what he cannot accomplish by his
   own force. His coming or attempting to come to Philadelphia is a
   circumstance that proves his weakness: for no general that felt himself
   able to take the field and attack his antagonist would think of bringing
   his army into a city in the summer time; and this mere shifting the scene
   from place to place, without effecting any thing, has feebleness and
   cowardice on the face of it, and holds him up in a contemptible light to
   all who can reason justly and firmly. By several informations from New
   York, it appears that their army in general, both officers and men, have
   given up the expectation of conquering America; their eye now is fixed
   upon the spoil. They suppose Philadelphia to be rich with stores, and as
   they think to get more by robbing a town than by attacking an army, their
   movement towards this city is probable. We are not now contending against
   an army of soldiers, but against a band of thieves, who had rather plunder
   than fight, and have no other hope of conquest than by cruelty.

   They expect to get a mighty booty, and strike another general panic, by
   making a sudden movement and getting possession of this city; but unless
   they can march out as well as in, or get the entire command of the river,
   to remove off their plunder, they may probably be stopped with the stolen
   goods upon them. They have never yet succeeded wherever they have been
   opposed, but at Fort Washington. At Charleston their defeat was effectual.
   At Ticonderoga they ran away. In every skirmish at Kingsbridge and the
   White Plains they were obliged to retreat, and the instant that our arms
   were turned upon them in the Jerseys, they turned likewise, and those that
   turned not were taken.

   The necessity of always fitting our internal police to the circumstances
   of the times we live in, is something so strikingly obvious, that no
   sufficient objection can be made against it. The safety of all societies
   depends upon it; and where this point is not attended to, the consequences
   will either be a general languor or a tumult. The encouragement and
   protection of the good subjects of any state, and the suppression and
   punishment of bad ones, are the principal objects for which all authority
   is instituted, and the line in which it ought to operate. We have in this
   city a strange variety of men and characters, and the circumstances of the
   times require that they should be publicly known; it is not the number of
   Tories that hurt us, so much as the not finding out who they are; men must
   now take one side or the other, and abide by the consequences: the
   Quakers, trusting to their short-sighted sagacity, have, most unluckily
   for them, made their declaration in their last Testimony, and we ought now
   to take them at their word. They have involuntarily read themselves out of
   the continental meeting, and cannot hope to be restored to it again but by
   payment and penitence. Men whose political principles are founded on
   avarice, are beyond the reach of reason, and the only cure of Toryism of
   this cast is to tax it. A substantial good drawn from a real evil, is of
   the same benefit to society, as if drawn from a virtue; and where men have
   not public spirit to render themselves serviceable, it ought to be the
   study of government to draw the best use possible from their vices. When
   the governing passion of any man, or set of men, is once known, the method
   of managing them is easy; for even misers, whom no public virtue can
   impress, would become generous, could a heavy tax be laid upon
   covetousness.

   The Tories have endeavored to insure their property with the enemy, by
   forfeiting their reputation with us; from which may be justly inferred,
   that their governing passion is avarice. Make them as much afraid of
   losing on one side as on the other, and you stagger their Toryism; make
   them more so, and you reclaim them; for their principle is to worship the
   power which they are most afraid of.

   This method of considering men and things together, opens into a large
   field for speculation, and affords me an opportunity of offering some
   observations on the state of our currency, so as to make the support of it
   go hand in hand with the suppression of disaffection and the encouragement
   of public spirit.

   The thing which first presents itself in inspecting the state of the
   currency, is, that we have too much of it, and that there is a necessity
   of reducing the quantity, in order to increase the value. Men are daily
   growing poor by the very means that they take to get rich; for in the same
   proportion that the prices of all goods on hand are raised, the value of
   all money laid by is reduced. A simple case will make this clear; let a
   man have 100 L. in cash, and as many goods on hand as will to-day sell for
   20 L.; but not content with the present market price, he raises them to 40
   L. and by so doing obliges others, in their own defence, to raise cent.
   per cent. likewise; in this case it is evident that his hundred pounds
   laid by, is reduced fifty pounds in value; whereas, had the market lowered
   cent. per cent., his goods would have sold but for ten, but his hundred
   pounds would have risen in value to two hundred; because it would then
   purchase as many goods again, or support his family as long again as
   before. And, strange as it may seem, he is one hundred and fifty pounds
   the poorer for raising his goods, to what he would have been had he
   lowered them; because the forty pounds which his goods sold for, is, by
   the general raise of the market cent. per cent., rendered of no more value
   than the ten pounds would be had the market fallen in the same proportion;
   and, consequently, the whole difference of gain or loss is on the
   difference in value of the hundred pounds laid by, viz. from fifty to two
   hundred. This rage for raising goods is for several reasons much more the
   fault of the Tories than the Whigs; and yet the Tories (to their shame and
   confusion ought they to be told of it) are by far the most noisy and
   discontented. The greatest part of the Whigs, by being now either in the
   army or employed in some public service, are buyers only and not sellers,
   and as this evil has its origin in trade, it cannot be charged on those
   who are out of it.

   But the grievance has now become too general to be remedied by partial
   methods, and the only effectual cure is to reduce the quantity of money:
   with half the quantity we should be richer than we are now, because the
   value of it would be doubled, and consequently our attachment to it
   increased; for it is not the number of dollars that a man has, but how far
   they will go, that makes him either rich or poor. These two points being
   admitted, viz. that the quantity of money is too great, and that the
   prices of goods can only be effectually reduced by, reducing the quantity
   of the money, the next point to be considered is, the method how to reduce
   it.

   The circumstances of the times, as before observed, require that the
   public characters of all men should now be fully understood, and the only
   general method of ascertaining it is by an oath or affirmation, renouncing
   all allegiance to the king of Great Britain, and to support the
   independence of the United States, as declared by Congress. Let, at the
   same time, a tax of ten, fifteen, or twenty per cent. per annum, to be
   collected quarterly, be levied on all property. These alternatives, by
   being perfectly voluntary, will take in all sorts of people. Here is the
   test; here is the tax. He who takes the former, conscientiously proves his
   affection to the cause, and binds himself to pay his quota by the best
   services in his power, and is thereby justly exempt from the latter; and
   those who choose the latter, pay their quota in money, to be excused from
   the former, or rather, it is the price paid to us for their supposed,
   though mistaken, insurance with the enemy.

   But this is only a part of the advantage which would arise by knowing the
   different characters of men. The Whigs stake everything on the issue of
   their arms, while the Tories, by their disaffection, are sapping and
   undermining their strength; and, of consequence, the property of the Whigs
   is the more exposed thereby; and whatever injury their estates may sustain
   by the movements of the enemy, must either be borne by themselves, who
   have done everything which has yet been done, or by the Tories, who have
   not only done nothing, but have, by their disaffection, invited the enemy
   on.

   In the present crisis we ought to know, square by square and house by
   house, who are in real allegiance with the United Independent States, and
   who are not. Let but the line be made clear and distinct, and all men will
   then know what they are to trust to. It would not only be good policy but
   strict justice, to raise fifty or one hundred thousand pounds, or more, if
   it is necessary, out of the estates and property of the king of England's
   votaries, resident in Philadelphia, to be distributed, as a reward to
   those inhabitants of the city and State, who should turn out and repulse
   the enemy, should they attempt to march this way; and likewise, to bind
   the property of all such persons to make good the damages which that of
   the Whigs might sustain. In the undistinguishable mode of conducting a
   war, we frequently make reprisals at sea, on the vessels of persons in
   England, who are friends to our cause compared with the resident Tories
   among us.

   In every former publication of mine, from Common Sense down to the last
   Crisis, I have generally gone on the charitable supposition, that the
   Tories were rather a mistaken than a criminal people, and have applied
   argument after argument, with all the candor and temper which I was
   capable of, in order to set every part of the case clearly and fairly
   before them, and if possible to reclaim them from ruin to reason. I have
   done my duty by them and have now done with that doctrine, taking it for
   granted, that those who yet hold their disaffection are either a set of
   avaricious miscreants, who would sacrifice the continent to save
   themselves, or a banditti of hungry traitors, who are hoping for a
   division of the spoil. To which may be added, a list of crown or
   proprietary dependants, who, rather than go without a portion of power,
   would be content to share it with the devil. Of such men there is no hope;
   and their obedience will only be according to the danger set before them,
   and the power that is exercised over them.

   A time will shortly arrive, in which, by ascertaining the characters of
   persons now, we shall be guarded against their mischiefs then; for in
   proportion as the enemy despair of conquest, they will be trying the arts
   of seduction and the force of fear by all the mischiefs which they can
   inflict. But in war we may be certain of these two things, viz. that
   cruelty in an enemy, and motions made with more than usual parade, are
   always signs of weakness. He that can conquer, finds his mind too free and
   pleasant to be brutish; and he that intends to conquer, never makes too
   much show of his strength.

   We now know the enemy we have to do with. While drunk with the certainty
   of victory, they disdained to be civil; and in proportion as
   disappointment makes them sober, and their apprehensions of an European
   war alarm them, they will become cringing and artful; honest they cannot
   be. But our answer to them, in either condition they may be in, is short
   and full- "As free and independent States we are willing to make peace
   with you to-morrow, but we neither can hear nor reply in any other
   character."

   If Britain cannot conquer us, it proves that she is neither able to govern
   nor protect us, and our particular situation now is such, that any
   connection with her would be unwisely exchanging a half-defeated enemy for
   two powerful ones. Europe, by every appearance, is now on the eve, nay, on
   the morning twilight of a war, and any alliance with George the Third
   brings France and Spain upon our backs; a separation from him attaches
   them to our side; therefore, the only road to peace, honor and commerce is
   Independence.

   Written this fourth year of the UNION, which God preserve.

   COMMON SENSE.
