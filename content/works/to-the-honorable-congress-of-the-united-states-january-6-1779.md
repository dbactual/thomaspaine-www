   To the Honorable Congress of the United States  January 6, 1779

   PHILADELPHIA,

   HONORABLE SIRS:

   Understanding that exceptions have been taken at some parts of my conduct,
   which exceptions as I am unacquainted with I cannot reply to, I therefore
   humbly beg leave to submit every part of my conduct public and private, so
   far as relate to public measures, to the judgment of this Honorable House,
   to be by them approved or censured as they shall judge proper-at the same
   time reserving to myself that conscious satisfaction of having ever
   intended well and to the best of my abilities executed these intentions.

   The Honorable Congress in April, 1777, were pleased, not only unsolicited
   on my part, but wholly unknown to me, to appoint me unanimously Secretary
   to the Committee for Foreign Affairs, which mode of appointment I conceive
   to be the most honorable that can take place. The salary they were pleased
   to affix to it was 70 dollars per month. It has remained at the same rate
   ever since, and is not at this time equal to the most moderate expenses I
   can live at; yet I have never complained, and always conceiving it my duty
   to bear a share of the inconveniences of the country, have ever cheerfully
   submitted to them. This being my situation, I am at this time conscious of
   no error, unless the cheapness of my services, and the generosity with
   which I have endeavored to do good in other respects, can be imputed to me
   as a crime, by such individuals as may have acted otherwise.

   As my appointment was honorable, therefore whenever it shall appear to
   Congress that I have not fulfilled their expectations, I shall, though
   with concern at any misapprehension that might lead to such an opinion,
   surrender up the books and papers entrusted to my care.

   Were my appointment an office of profit it might become me to resign it,
   but as it is otherwise I conceive that such a step in me might imply a
   dissatisfaction on account of the smallness of the pay. Therefore I think
   it my duty to wait the orders of this honorable House, at the same time
   begging leave to assure them that whatever may be their determination
   respecting me, my disposition to serve in so honorable a cause, and in any
   character in which I can best do it, will suffer no alteration.

   I am, with profound respect, your honors' dutiful and obedient humble
   servant,

   THOMAS PAINE.

   EDITOR:

   (The Reply of M. Gerard, dated January 2, 1779, reads:

   "SIR:

   "The attention which you showed to me in giving me notice of the time of
   the publication which shall take place tomorrow requires my thanks, and I
   deliver them to you with pleasure and confidence.

   "I am fully persuaded that you will remember that all what I had the honor
   to say to you has no reference to any person and that I have care but for
   the direct honor and interest of my court and that my desire is rather
   that all personal reference should be avoided as far as it could start
   questions which would be desirable, should be avoided; but the sentiment
   you profess leave no occasion to fear about this delicate object that
   commands my most serious concern.

   "I am with great regard.

   "M. GERARD")
