   Philip Foner's introduction:

   Paine signed this article, which was published in the Pennsylvania
   Magazine of March, 1775, "Atlanticus." Together with "A Serious Thought"
   and references in Common Sense, it reveals Paine's great interest in the
   struggle of the people of India for freedom and independence.

   AH! The tale is told-The scene is ended-and the curtain falls. As an
   emblem of the vanity of all earthly pomp, let his monument be a globe, but
   be that globe a bubble; let his effigy be a man walking round it in his
   sleep; and let fame, in the character of a shadow, inscribe his honors on
   the air.

   I view him but as yesterday on the burning plains of Plassey1, doubtful of
   life, health, or victory. I see him in the instant when "To be or not to
   be," were equal chances to a human eye. To be a lord or a slave, to return
   loaded with the spoils, or remain mingled with the dust of India. Did
   necessity always justify the severity of a conqueror, the rude tongue of
   censure would be silent, and however painfully he might look back on
   scenes of horror, the pensive reflection would not alarm him. Though his
   feelings suffered, his conscience would be acquitted. The sad remembrance
   would move serenely, and leave the mind without a wound. But oh India!
   thou loud proclaimer of European cruelties, thou bloody monument of
   unnecessary deaths, be tender in the day of inquiry, and show a Christian
   world thou canst suffer and forgive.

   Departed from India, and loaded with plunder, I see him doubling the Cape
   and looking wistfully to Europe. I see him contemplating on years of
   pleasure, and gratifying his ambition with expected honors. I see his
   arrival pompously announced in every newspaper, his eager eye rambling
   through the crowd in quest of homage, and his ear listening lest an
   applause should escape him. Happily for him he arrived before his fame,
   and the short interval was a time of rest. From the crowd I follow him to
   the court, I see him enveloped in the sunshine of sovereign favor,
   rivaling the great in honors, the proud in splendor, and the rich in
   wealth. From the court I trace him to the country, his equipage moves like
   a camp; every village bell proclaims his coming; the wondering peasants
   admire his pomp, and his heart runs over with joy.

   But, alas! not satisfied with uncountable thousands, I accompany him again
   to India. I mark the variety of countenances which appear at his landing.
   Confusion spreads the news. Every passion seems alarmed. The wailing
   widow, the crying orphan, and the childless parent remember and lament;
   the rival nabobs court his favor; the rich dread his power, and the poor
   his severity. Fear and terror march like pioneers before his camp, murder
   and rapine accompany it, famine and wretchedness follow in the rear.

   Resolved on accumulating an unbounded fortune, he enters into all the
   schemes of war, treaty, and intrigue. The British sword is set up for
   sale; the heads of contending nabobs are offered at a price, and the bribe
   taken from both sides. Thousands of men or money are trifles in an India
   bargain. The field is an empire, and the treasure almost without end. The
   wretched inhabitants are glad to compound for offences never committed,
   and to purchase at any rate the privilege to breathe; while he, the sole
   lord of their lives and fortunes, disposes of either as he pleases, and
   prepares for Europe2.

   Uncommon fortunes require an uncommon date of life to enjoy them in. The
   usual period is spent in preparing to live: And unless nature prolongs the
   time, fortune bestows her excess of favors in vain.

   The conqueror of the east having nothing more to expect from the one, has
   all his court to make to the other. Anxiety for wealth gives place to
   anxiety for life; and wisely recollecting that the sea is no respecter of
   persons, resolves on taking his route to Europe by land. Little beings
   move unseen, or unobserved, but he engrosses whole kingdoms in his march,
   and is gazed at like a comet. The burning desert, the pathless mountains,
   and the fertile valleys, are in their turns explored and passed over. No
   material accident distresses his progress, and England once more receives
   the spoiler.

   How sweet is rest to the weary traveler; the retrospect heightens the
   enjoyment; and if the future prospect be serene, the days of ease and
   happiness are arrived. An uninquiring observer might have been inclined to
   consider Lord Clive, under all these agreeable circumstances, one whose
   every care was over, and who had nothing to do but sit down and say, Soul,
   take thine ease, thou hast goods laid up in store for many years.

   The reception which he met with on his second arrival, was in every
   instance equal to, and in many exceeded, the honors of the first. 'Tis the
   peculiar temper of the English to applaud before they think. Generous of
   their praise, they frequently bestow it unworthily: but when once the
   truth arrives, the torrent stops, and rushes back again with the same
   violence3. Scarcely had the echo of the applause ceased upon the ear, then
   the rude tongue of censure took up the tale. The newspapers, fatal enemies
   to ill-gotten wealth! began to buzz a general suspicion of his conduct,
   and the inquisitive public soon refined it into particulars. Every post
   gave a stab to his fame-a wound to his peace-and a nail to his coffin.
   Like spectres from the grave they haunted him in every company, and
   whispered murder in his ear. A life chequered with uncommon varieties is
   seldom a long one. Action and care will in time wear down the strongest
   frame, but guilt and melancholy are poisons of quick despatch.

   Say, cool deliberate reflection was the prize, though abstracted from the
   guilt, worthy of the pains? Ah no! Fatigued with victory he sat down to
   rest, and while he was recovering breath he lost it. A conqueror more
   fatal than himself beset him, and revenged the injuries done to India.

   As a cure for avarice and ambition let us take a view of him in his latter
   years. Ha! what gloomy being wanders yonder? How visibly is the melancholy
   heart delineated on his countenance. He mourns no common care-his very
   steps are timed to sorrow-he trembles with a kind of mental palsy. Perhaps
   'tis some broken hearted parent, some David mourning for his Absalom, or
   some Heraclitus weeping for the world. I hear him mutter something about
   wealth. Perhaps he is poor, and has not wherewithal to hide his head. Some
   debtor started from his sleepless pillow, to ruminate on poverty and
   ponder on the horrors of a jail. Poor man! I'll to him and relieve him.
   Ha! 'tis Lord Clive himself! Bless me, what a change! He makes, I see, for
   yonder cypress shade-fit scene for melancholy hearts! I'll watch him there
   and listen to his story.

   LORD CLIVE. "Can I but suffer when a beggar pities me. Erewhile I heard a
   ragged wretch, who every mark of poverty had on, say to a sooty sweep. Ah,
   poor Lord Clive! While he the Negro-colored vagrant, more mercifully
   cruel, cursed me in my hearing.

   "There was a time when fortune, like a yielding mistress, courted me with
   smiles-She never waited to be told my wishes, but studied to discover
   them, and seemed not happy to herself, but when she had some favor to
   bestow. Ah! little did I think the fair enchantress would desert me thus;
   and after lavishing her smiles upon me, turn my reproacher, and publish me
   in folio to the world. Volumes of morality are dull and spiritless
   compared to me. Lord Clive is himself a treatise upon vanity, printed in a
   golden type. The most unlettered clown writes explanatory notes thereon,
   and reads them to his children. Yet I could bear these insults could I but
   bear myself. A strange unwelcome something hangs about me. In company I
   seem no company at all. The festive board appears to me a stage, the
   crimson colored port resembles blood. Each glass is strangely
   metamorphosed to a man in armor, and every bowl appears a nabob. The
   joyous toast is like the sound of murder, and the loud laughs are groans
   of dying men. The scenes of India are all rehearsed, and no one sees the
   tragedy but myself. Ah! I discover things which are not, and hear
   unuttered sounds-

   "O peace, thou sweet companion of the calm and innocent! Whither art thou
   fled? Here take my gold, and all the world calls mine, and come thou in
   exchange. Or thou, thou noisy sweep, who mix thy food with soot and relish
   it, who canst descend from lofty heights and walk the humble earth again,
   without repining at the change, come teach that mystery to me. Or thou,
   thou ragged wandering beggar, who, when thou canst not beg successfully,
   will pilfer from the hound, and eat the dirty morsel sweetly; be thou Lord
   Clive, and I will beg, so I may laugh like thee.

   "Could I unlearn what I've already learned-unact what I've already
   acted-or would some sacred power convey me back to youth and innocence,
   I'd act another part-I'd keep within the value of humble life, nor wish
   for what the world calls pomp.

   "But since this cannot be,

   And only a few days and sad remain for me,

   I'll haste to quit the scene; for what is life

   When every passion of the soul's at strife?"4

   ATLANTICUS.

   1. Battle of Plassey, in the East Indies, where Lord Clive, at that time
   Colonel Clive, acquired an immense fortune, and from which place his title
   is taken.-Author.

   2. In April, 1773, a Committee of the House of Commons, under the name of
   the Select Committee, were appointed to inquire into the state of the East
   India affairs, and the conduct of the several Governors of Bengal. The
   Committee having gone through the examinations, General Burgoyne, the
   chairman, prefaced their report to the House, informing them, "that the
   reports contained accounts shocking to human nature, that the most
   infamous designs had been carried into execution by perfidy and murder."
   He recapitulated the wretched situation of the East-Indian princes, who
   held their dignities on the precarious condition of being the highest
   bribers. No claim, however just on their part, he said, could be admitted
   without being introduced with enormous sums of rupees, nor any prince
   suffered to reign long, who did not quadrate with this idea; and that Lord
   Clive, over and above the enormous sums he might with some appearance of
   justice lay claim to, had obtained others to which he could have no title.
   He (General Burgoyne) therefore moved, "That it appears to this house,
   that Robert Lord Clive, Baron of Plassey, about the time of deposing
   Surajah Dowla, nabob of Bengal, and establishing Meer Jaffier in his room,
   did, through the influence of the power with which he was entrusted, as
   member of the Select Committee in India, and Commander-in-Chief of the
   British forces there, obtain and possess himself of two lacks of rupees,
   as member of the Select Committee; a further sum of two lacks and 80,000
   rupees, as member of the Select Committee; a further sum of two lacks of
   rupees, as Commander-in-Chief; a further sum of 16 lacks of rupees, or
   more, under the denomination of private donations; which sums, amounting
   together to 20 lacks and 80,000 rupees, were of the value, in English
   money, of -L-234,000, (equal to -L-340,000 Pennsylvania currency), and
   that in so doing, the said Robert Lord Clive abused the powers with which
   he was entrusted, to the evil example of the servants of the
   public."-Author.

   3. Lord Clive, in the defence which he made in the House of Commons,
   against the charges mentioned in the preceding note, very positively
   insists on his innocence, and very pathetically laments his situation; and
   after informing the House of the thanks which he had some years before
   received, for the same actions which they are now endeavoring to censure
   him for, he says, "After such certificates as these, Sir, am I to be
   brought here like a criminal, and the very best part of my conduct
   construed into crimes against the State? Is this the reward that is now
   held out to persons who have performed such important services to their
   country? If it is, Sir, the future consequences that will attend the
   execution of any important trust, committed to the persons who have the
   care of it, will be fatal indeed; and I am sure the noble Lord upon the
   treasury bench, whose great humanity and abilities I revere, would never
   have consented to the resolutions that passed the other night, if he had
   thought on the dreadful consequences that would attend them. Sir, I cannot
   say that I either sit or rest easy, when I find that all I have in the
   world is likely to be confiscated, and that no one will take my security
   for a shilling. These, Sir, are dreadful apprehensions to remain under,
   and I cannot but look upon myself as a bankrupt. I have not anything left
   which I can call my own, except my paternal fortune of -L-500 per annum,
   and which has been in the family for ages past. But upon this I am
   contented to live, and perhaps I shall find more real content of mind and
   happiness than in the trembling affluence of an unsettled fortune. But,
   Sir, I must make one more observation, that, if the definition of the Hon.
   Gentleman, [General Burgoyne,] and of this House, is that the State, as
   expressed in these resolutions is, quoad hoc, the company, then, Sir,
   every farthing that I enjoy is granted to me. But to be called, after
   sixteen years have elapsed, to account for my conduct in this manner, and
   after an uninterrupted enjoyment of my property, to be questioned and
   considered as obtaining it unwarrantably, is hard minded! and a treatment
   I should not think the British Senate capable of. But if it should be the
   case, I have a conscious innocence within me, that tells me my conduct is
   irreproachable. Frangas, non flectes. They may take from me what I have;
   they may, as they think, make me poor, but I will be happy I I mean not
   this as my defence. My defence will be made at the bar; and before I sit
   down, I have one request to make to the House, that when they come to
   decide upon my honor, they will not forget their own."-Author.

   4. Some time before his death he became very melancholy-subject to strange
   imaginations-and was found dead at last.-Author.
