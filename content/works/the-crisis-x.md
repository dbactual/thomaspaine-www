   Crisis X

    

   Foner's introduction:

   On October 19, 1781, Lord Cornwallis, outnumbered three to one on land and
   cut off from fresh supplies by sea, surrendered his army of 7,000 men at
   Yorktown. A month later, November 27, 1781, King George the Third
   delivered a bellicose speech at the opening of Parliament, and Parliament
   voted to continue the war. In Crisis X, March 5, 1782, Paine replied to
   the King's speech.

   In the second part of this article Paine placed great stress upon the need
   for united national action and centralized government as against the
   particularism of the separate states, and stressed the supremacy of the
   Federal Government: "Each State is to the United States what each
   individual is to the state he lives in. And it is on this grand point,
   this movement upon one centre, that our existence as a nation, our
   happiness as a people, and our safety as individuals, depend."

   ON THE KING OF ENGLAND'S SPEECH

   OF all the innocent passions which actuate the human mind there is none
   more universally prevalent than curiosity. It reaches all mankind, and in
   matters which concern us, or concern us not, it alike provokes in us a
   desire to know them.

   Although the situation of America, superior to every effort to enslave
   her, and daily rising to importance and opulence, has placed her above the
   region of anxiety, it has still left her within the circle of curiosity;
   and her fancy to see the speech of a man who had proudly threatened to
   bring her to his feet, was visibly marked with that tranquil confidence
   which cared nothing about its contents. It was inquired after with a
   smile, read with a laugh, and dismissed with disdain.

   But, as justice is due, even to an enemy, it is right to say, that the
   speech is as well managed as the embarrassed condition of their affairs
   could well admit of; and though hardly a line of it is true, except the
   mournful story of Cornwallis, it may serve to amuse the deluded commons
   and people of England, for whom it was calculated.

   "The war," says the speech, "is still unhappily prolonged by that restless
   ambition which first excited our enemies to commence it, and which still
   continues to disappoint my earnest wishes and diligent exertions to
   restore the public tranquillity."

   How easy it is to abuse truth and language, when men, by habitual
   wickedness, have learned to set justice at defiance. That the very man who
   began the war, who with the most sullen insolence refused to answer, and
   even to hear the humblest of all petitions, who has encouraged his
   officers and his army in the most savage cruelties, and the most
   scandalous plunderings, who has stirred up the Indians on one side, and
   the negroes on the other, and invoked every aid of hell in his behalf,
   should now, with an affected air of pity, turn the tables from himself,
   and charge to another the wickedness that is his own, can only be equalled
   by the baseness of the heart that spoke it.

   To be nobly wrong is more manly than to be meanly right, is an expression
   I once used on a former occasion, and it is equally applicable now. We
   feel something like respect for consistency even in error. We lament the
   virtue that is debauched into a vice, but the vice that affects a virtue
   becomes the more detestable: and amongst the various assumptions of
   character, which hypocrisy has taught, and men have practised, there is
   none that raises a higher relish of disgust, than to see disappointed
   inveteracy twisting itself, by the most visible falsehoods, into an
   appearance of piety which it has no pretensions to.

   "But I should not," continues the speech, "answer the trust committed to
   the sovereign of a free people, nor make a suitable return to my subjects
   for their constant, zealous, and affectionate attachment to my person,
   family and government, if I consented to sacrifice, either to my own
   desire of peace, or to their temporary ease and relief, those essential
   rights and permanent interests, upon the maintenance and preservation of
   which, the future strength and security of this country must principally
   depend."

   That the man whose ignorance and obstinacy first involved and still
   continues the nation in the most hopeless and expensive of all wars,
   should now meanly flatter them with the name of a free people, and make a
   merit of his crime, under the disguise of their essential rights and
   permanent interests, is something which disgraces even the character of
   perverseness. Is he afraid they will send him to Hanover, or what does he
   fear? Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who
   pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?

   What those essential rights and permanent interests are, on which the
   future strength and security of England must principally depend, are not
   so much as alluded to. They are words which impress nothing but the ear,
   and are calculated only for the sound.

   But if they have any reference to America, then do they amount to the
   disgraceful confession, that England, who once assumed to be her
   protectress, has now become her dependant. The British king and ministry
   are constantly holding up the vast importance which America is of to
   England, in order to allure the nation to carry on the war: now, whatever
   ground there is for this idea, it ought to have operated as a reason for
   not beginning it; and, therefore, they support their present measures to
   their own disgrace, because the arguments which they now use, are a direct
   reflection on their former policy.

   "The favorable appearance of affairs," continues the speech, "in the East
   Indies, and the safe arrival of the numerous commercial fleets of my
   kingdom, must have given you satisfaction."

   That things are not quite so bad every where as in America may be some
   cause of consolation, but can be none for triumph. One broken leg is
   better than two, but still it is not a source of joy: and let the
   appearance of affairs in the East Indies be ever so favorable, they are
   nevertheless worse than at first, without a prospect of their ever being
   better. But the mournful story of Cornwallis was yet to be told, and it
   was necessary to give it the softest introduction possible.

   "But in the course of this year," continues the speech, "my assiduous
   endeavors to guard the extensive dominions of my crown have not been
   attended with success equal to the justice and uprightness of my views."-
   What justice and uprightness there was in beginning a war with America,
   the world will judge of, and the unequalled barbarity with which it has
   been conducted, is not to be worn from the memory by the cant of
   snivelling hypocrisy.

   "And it is with great concern that I inform you that the events of war
   have been very unfortunate to my arms in Virginia, having ended in the
   loss of my forces in that province."- And our great concern is that they
   are not all served in the same manner.

   "No endeavors have been wanted on my part," says the speech, "to
   extinguish that spirit of rebellion which our enemies have found means to
   foment and maintain in the colonies; and to restore to my deluded subjects
   in America that happy and prosperous condition which they formerly derived
   from a due obedience to the laws."

   The expression of deluded subjects is become so hacknied and contemptible,
   and the more so when we see them making prisoners of whole armies at a
   time, that the pride of not being laughed at would induce a man of common
   sense to leave it off. But the most offensive falsehood in the paragraph
   is the attributing the prosperity of America to a wrong cause. It was the
   unremitted industry of the settlers and their descendants, the hard labor
   and toil of persevering fortitude, that were the true causes of the
   prosperity of America. The former tyranny of England served to people it,
   and the virtue of the adventurers to improve it. Ask the man, who, with
   his axe, has cleared a way in the wilderness, and now possesses an estate,
   what made him rich, and he will tell you the labor of his hands, the sweat
   of his brow, and the blessing of heaven. Let Britain but leave America to
   herself and she asks no more. She has risen into greatness without the
   knowledge and against the will of England, and has a right to the
   unmolested enjoyment of her own created wealth.

   "I will order," says the speech, "the estimates of the ensuing year to be
   laid before you. I rely on your wisdom and public spirit for such supplies
   as the circumstances of our affairs shall be found to require. Among the
   many ill consequences which attend the continuation of the present war, I
   most sincerely regret the additional burdens which it must unavoidably
   bring upon my faithful subjects."

   It is strange that a nation must run through such a labyrinth of trouble,
   and expend such a mass of wealth to gain the wisdom which an hour's
   reflection might have taught. The final superiority of America over every
   attempt that an island might make to conquer her, was as naturally marked
   in the constitution of things, as the future ability of a giant over a
   dwarf is delineated in his features while an infant. How far providence,
   to accomplish purposes which no human wisdom could foresee, permitted such
   extraordinary errors, is still a secret in the womb of time, and must
   remain so till futurity shall give it birth.

   "In the prosecution of this great and important contest," says the speech,
   "in which we are engaged, I retain a firm confidence in the protection of
   divine providence, and a perfect conviction in the justice of my cause,
   and I have no doubt, but, that by the concurrence and support of my
   Parliament, by the valour of my fleets and armies, and by a vigorous,
   animated, and united exertion of the faculties and resources of my people,
   I shall be enabled to restore the blessings of a safe and honorable peace
   to all my dominions."

   The King of England is one of the readiest believers in the world. In the
   beginning of the contest he passed an act to put America out of the
   protection of the crown of England, and though providence, for seven years
   together, has put him out of her protection, still the man has no doubt.
   Like Pharaoh on the edge of the Red Sea, he sees not the plunge he is
   making, and precipitately drives across the flood that is closing over his
   head.

   I think it is a reasonable supposition, that this part of the speech was
   composed before the arrival of the news of the capture of Cornwallis: for
   it certainly has no relation to their condition at the time it was spoken.
   But, be this as it may, it is nothing to us. Our line is fixed. Our lot is
   cast; and America, the child of fate, is arriving at maturity. We have
   nothing to do but by a spirited and quick exertion, to stand prepared for
   war or peace. Too great to yield, and too noble to insult; superior to
   misfortune, and generous in success, let us untaintedly preserve the
   character which we have gained, and show to future ages an example of
   unequalled magnanimity. There is something in the cause and consequence of
   America that has drawn on her the attention of all mankind. The world has
   seen her brave. Her love of liberty; her ardour in supporting it; the
   justice of her claims, and the constancy of her fortitude have won her the
   esteem of Europe, and attached to her interest the first power in that
   country.

   Her situation now is such, that to whatever point, past, present or to
   come, she casts her eyes, new matter rises to convince her that she is
   right. In her conduct towards her enemy, no reproachful sentiment lurks in
   secret. No sense of injustice is left upon the mind. Untainted with
   ambition, and a stranger to revenge, her progress has been marked by
   providence, and she, in every stage of the conflict, has blest her with
   success.

   But let not America wrap herself up in delusive hope and suppose the
   business done. The least remissness in preparation, the least relaxation
   in execution, will only serve to prolong the war, and increase expenses.
   If our enemies can draw consolation from misfortune, and exert themselves
   upon despair, how much more ought we, who are to win a continent by the
   conquest, and have already an earnest of success?

   Having, in the preceding part, made my remarks on the several matters
   which the speech contains, I shall now make my remarks on what it does not
   contain.

   There is not a syllable in its resp

   ecting alliances. Either the injustice of Britain is too glaring, or her
   condition too desperate, or both, for any neighboring power to come to her
   support. In the beginning of the contest, when she had only America to
   contend with, she hired assistance from Hesse, and other smaller states of
   Germany, and for nearly three years did America, young, raw, undisciplined
   and unprovided, stand against the power of Britain, aided by twenty
   thousand foreign troops, and made a complete conquest of one entire army.
   The remembrance of those things ought to inspire us with confidence and
   greatness of mind, and carry us through every remaining difficulty with
   content and cheerfulness. What are the little sufferings of the present
   day, compared with the hardships that are past? There was a time, when we
   had neither house nor home in safety; when every hour was the hour of
   alarm and danger; when the mind, tortured with anxiety, knew no repose,
   and every thing, but hope and fortitude, was bidding us farewell.

   It is of use to look back upon these things; to call to mind the times of
   trouble and the scenes of complicated anguish that are past and gone. Then
   every expense was cheap, compared with the dread of conquest and the
   misery of submission. We did not stand debating upon trifles, or
   contending about the necessary and unavoidable charges of defence. Every
   one bore his lot of suffering, and looked forward to happier days, and
   scenes of rest.

   Perhaps one of the greatest dangers which any country can be exposed to,
   arises from a kind of trifling which sometimes steals upon the mind, when
   it supposes the danger past; and this unsafe situation marks at this time
   the peculiar crisis of America. What would she once have given to have
   known that her condition at this day should be what it now is? And yet we
   do not seem to place a proper value upon it, nor vigorously pursue the
   necessary measures to secure it. We know that we cannot be defended, nor
   yet defend ourselves, without trouble and expense. We have no right to
   expect it; neither ought we to look for it. We are a people, who, in our
   situation, differ from all the world. We form one common floor of public
   good, and, whatever is our charge, it is paid for our own interest and
   upon our own account.

   Misfortune and experience have now taught us system and method; and the
   arrangements for carrying on the war are reduced to rule and order. The
   quotas of the several states are ascertained, and I intend in a future
   publication to show what they are, and the necessity as well as the
   advantages of vigorously providing for them.

   In the mean time, I shall conclude this paper with an instance of British
   clemency, from Smollett's History of England, vol. xi., printed in London.
   It will serve to show how dismal the situation of a conquered people is,
   and that the only security is an effectual defence.

   We all know that the Stuart family and the house of Hanover opposed each
   other for the crown of England. The Stuart family stood first in the line
   of succession, but the other was the most successful.

   In July, 1745, Charles, the son of the exiled king, landed in Scotland,
   collected a small force, at no time exceeding five or six thousand men,
   and made some attempts to re-establish his claim. The late Duke of
   Cumberland, uncle to the present King of England, was sent against him,
   and on the 16th of April following, Charles was totally defeated at
   Culloden, in Scotland. Success and power are the only situations in which
   clemency can be shown, and those who are cruel, because they are
   victorious, can with the same facility act any other degenerate character.

   "Immediately after the decisive action at Culloden, the Duke of Cumberland
   took possession of Inverness; where six and thirty deserters, convicted by
   a court martial, were ordered to be executed: then he detached several
   parties to ravage the country. One of these apprehended The Lady
   Mackintosh, who was sent prisoner to Inverness, plundered her house, and
   drove away her cattle, though her husband was actually in the service of
   the government. The castle of Lord Lovat was destroyed. The French
   prisoners were sent to Carlisle and Penrith: Kilmarnock, Balmerino,
   Cromartie, and his son, The Lord Macleod, were conveyed by sea to London;
   and those of an inferior rank were confined in different prisons. The
   Marquis of Tullibardine, together with a brother of the Earl of Dunmore,
   and Murray, the pretender's secretary, were seized and transported to the
   Tower of London, to which the Earl of Traquaire had been committed on
   suspicion; and the eldest son of Lord Lovat was imprisoned in the castle
   of Edinburgh. In a word, all the jails in Great Britain, from the capital,
   northwards, were filled with those unfortunate captives; and great numbers
   of them were crowded together in the holds of ships, where they perished
   in the most deplorable manner, for want of air and exercise. Some rebel
   chiefs escaped in two French frigates that arrived on the coast of
   Lochaber about the end of April, and engaged three vessels belonging to
   his Britannic majesty, which they obliged to retire. Others embarked on
   board a ship on the coast of Buchan, and were conveyed to Norway, from
   whence they travelled to Sweden. In the month of May, the Duke of
   Cumberland advanced with the army into the Highlands, as far as Fort
   Augustus, where he encamped; and sent off detachments on all hands, to
   hunt down the fugitives, and lay waste the country with fire and sword.
   The castles of Glengary and Lochiel were plundered and burned; every
   house, hut, or habitation, met with the same fate, without distinction;
   and all the cattle and provision were carried off; the men were either
   shot upon the mountains, like wild beasts, or put to death in cold blood,
   without form of trial; the women, after having seen their husbands and
   fathers murdered, were subjected to brutal violation, and then turned out
   naked, with their children, to starve on the barren heaths. One whole
   family was enclosed in a barn, and consumed to ashes. Those ministers of
   vengeance were so alert in the execution of their office, that in a few
   days there was neither house, cottage, man, nor beast, to be seen within
   the compass of fifty miles; all was ruin, silence, and desolation."

   I have here presented the reader with one of the most shocking instances
   of cruelty ever practised, and I leave it, to rest on his mind, that he
   may be fully impressed with a sense of the destruction he has escaped, in
   case Britain had conquered America; and likewise, that he may see and feel
   the necessity, as well for his own personal safety, as for the honor, the
   interest, and happiness of the whole community, to omit or delay no one
   preparation necessary to secure the ground which we so happily stand upon.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   To THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA

   On the expenses, arrangements and disbursements for carrying on

   the war, and finishing it with honor and advantage

   When any necessity or occasion has pointed out the convenience of
   addressing the public, I have never made it a consideration whether the
   subject was popular or unpopular, but whether it was right or wrong; for
   that which is right will become popular, and that which is wrong,

   though by mistake it may obtain the cry or fashion of the day, will soon
   lose the power of delusion, and sink into disesteem.

   A remarkable instance of this happened in the case of Silas Deane; and I
   mention this circumstance with the greater ease, because the poison of his
   hypocrisy spread over the whole country, and every man, almost without
   exception, thought me wrong in opposing him. The best friends I then had,
   except Mr. Laurens, stood at a distance, and this tribute, which is due to
   his constancy, I pay to him with respect, and that the readier, because he
   is not here to hear it. If it reaches him in his imprisonment, it will
   afford him an agreeable reflection.

   "As he rose like a rocket, he would fall like a stick," is a metaphor
   which I applied to Mr. Deane, in the first piece which I published
   respecting him, and he has exactly fulfilled the description. The credit
   he so unjustly obtained from the public, he lost in almost as short a
   time. The delusion perished as it fell, and he soon saw himself stripped
   of popular support. His more intimate acquaintances began to doubt, and to
   desert him long before he left America, and at his departure, he saw
   himself the object of general suspicion. When he arrived in France, he
   endeavored to effect by treason what he had failed to accomplish by fraud.
   His plans, schemes and projects, together with his expectation of being
   sent to Holland to negotiate a loan of money, had all miscarried. He then
   began traducing and accusing America of every crime, which could injure
   her reputation. "That she was a ruined country; that she only meant to
   make a tool of France, to get what money she could out of her, and then to
   leave her and accommodate with Britain." Of all which and much more,
   Colonel Laurens and myself, when in France, informed Dr. Franklin, who had
   not before heard of it. And to complete the character of traitor, he has,
   by letters to his country since, some of which, in his own handwriting,
   are now in the possession of Congress, used every expression and argument
   in his power, to injure the reputation of France, and to advise America to
   renounce her alliance, and surrender up her independence. [Mr. William
   Marshall, of this city [Philadelphia], formerly a pilot, who had been
   taken at sea and carried to England, and got from thence to France,
   brought over letters from Mr. Deane to America, one of which was directed
   to "Robert Morris, Esq." Mr. Morris sent it unopened to Congress, and
   advised Mr. Marshall to deliver the others there, which he did. The
   letters were of the same purport with those which have been
   alreadypublished under the signature of S. Deane, to which they had
   frequent reference.-Author.]

   Thus in France he abuses America, and in his letters to America he abuses
   France; and is endeavoring to create disunion between two countries, by
   the same arts of double-dealing by which he caused dissensions among the
   commissioners in Paris, and distractions in America. But his life has been
   fraud, and his character has been that of a plodding, plotting, cringing
   mercenary, capable of any disguise that suited his purpose. His final
   detection has very happily cleared up those mistakes, and removed that
   uneasiness, which his unprincipled conduct occasioned. Every one now sees
   him in the same light; for towards friends or enemies he acted with the
   same deception and injustice, and his name, like that of Arnold, ought now
   to be forgotten among us. As this is the first time that I have mentioned
   him since my return from France, it is my intention that it shall be the
   last. From this digression, which for several reasons I thought necessary
   to give, I now proceed to the purport of my address.

   I consider the war of America against Britain as the country's war, the
   public's war, or the war of the people in their own behalf, for the
   security of their natural rights, and the protection of their own
   property. It is not the war of Congress, the war of the assemblies, or the
   war of government in any line whatever. The country first, by mutual
   compact, resolved to defend their rights and maintain their independence,
   at the hazard of their lives and fortunes; they elected their
   representatives, by whom they appointed their members of Congress, and
   said, act you for us, and we will support you. This is the true ground and
   principle of the war on the part of America, and, consequently, there
   remains nothing to do, but for every one to fulfil his obligation.

   It was next to impossible that a new country, engaged in a new
   undertaking, could set off systematically right at first. She saw not the
   extent of the struggle that she was involved in, neither could she avoid
   the beginning. She supposed every step that she took, and every resolution
   which she formed, would bring her enemy to reason and close the contest.
   Those failing, she was forced into new measures; and these, like the
   former, being fitted to her expectations, and failing in their turn, left
   her continually unprovided, and without system. The enemy, likewise, was
   induced to prosecute the war, from the temporary expedients we adopted for
   carrying it on. We were continually expecting to see their credit
   exhausted, and they were looking to see our currency fail; and thus,
   between their watching us, and we them, the hopes of both have been
   deceived, and the childishness of the expectation has served to increase
   the expense.

   Yet who, through this wilderness of error, has been to blame? Where is the
   man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his? They were the
   natural, unavoidable errors of the day. They were the errors of a whole
   country, which nothing but experience could detect and time remove.
   Neither could the circumstances of America admit of system, till either
   the paper currency was fixed or laid aside. No calculation of a finance
   could be made on a medium failing without reason, and fluctuating without
   rule.

   But there is one error which might have been prevented and was not; and as
   it is not my custom to flatter, but to serve mankind, I will speak it
   freely. It certainly was the duty of every assembly on the continent to
   have known, at all times, what was the condition of its treasury, and to
   have ascertained at every period of depreciation, how much the real worth
   of the taxes fell short of their nominal value. This knowledge, which
   might have been easily gained, in the time of it, would have enabled them
   to have kept their constituents well informed, and this is one of the
   greatest duties of representation. They ought to have studied and
   calculated the expenses of the war, the quota of each state, and the
   consequent proportion that would fall on each man's property for his
   defence; and this must have easily shown to them, that a tax of one
   hundred pounds could not be paid by a bushel of apples or an hundred of
   flour, which was often the case two or three years ago. But instead of
   this, which would have been plain and upright dealing, the little line of
   temporary popularity, the feather of an hour's duration, was too much
   pursued; and in this involved condition of things, every state, for the
   want of a little thinking, or a little information, supposed that it
   supported the whole expenses of the war, when in fact it fell, by the time
   the tax was levied and collected, above three-fourths short of its own
   quota. Impressed with a sense of the danger to which the country was
   exposed by this lax method of doing business, and the prevailing errors of
   the day, I published, last October was a twelvemonth, the Crisis
   Extraordinary, on the revenues of America, and the yearly expense of
   carrying on the war. My estimation of the latter, together with the civil
   list of Congress, and the civil list of the several states, was two
   million pounds sterling, which is very nearly nine millions of dollars.

   Since that time, Congress have gone into a calculation, and have estimated
   the expenses of the War Department and the civil list of Congress
   (exclusive of the civil list of the several governments) at eight millions
   of dollars; and as the remaining million will be fully sufficient for the
   civil list of the several states, the two calculations are exceedingly
   near each other.

   The sum of eight millions of dollars have called upon the states to
   furnish, and their quotas are as follows, which I shall preface with the
   resolution itself.

   "By the United States in Congress assembled.

   "October 30, 1781.

   "Resolved, That the respective states be called upon to furnish the
   treasury

   of the United States with their quotas of eight millions of dollars, for
   the

   War Department and civil list for the ensuing year, to be paid quarterly,
   in

   equal proportions, the first payment to be made on the first day of April
   next.

   "Resolved, That a committee, consisting of a member from each state,

   be appointed to apportion to the several states the quota of the above
   sum.

   "November 2d. The committee appointed to ascertain the proportions of

   the several states of the monies to be raised for the expenses of the
   ensuing

   year, report the following resolutions:

   "That the sum of eight millions of dollars, as required to be raised by
   the

   resolutions of the 30th of October last, be paid by the states in the
   following

   proportion:

   New Hampshire $373,598

   Massachusetts 1,307,596

   Rhode Island 216,684

   Connecticut 747,196

   New York 373*598

   New Jersey 485,679

   Pennsylvania 1,120,794

   Delaware 112,085

   Maryland 933,096

   Virginia 1,307,594

   North Carolina 622,677

   South Carolina 373,598

   Georgia 24,905

   $8,000,000

   "Resolved, That it be recommended to the several states, to lay taxes for
   raising their quotas of money for the United States, separate from those
   laid for their own particular use."

   On these resolutions I shall offer several remarks.

   1st, On the sum itself, and the ability of the country.

   2d, On the several quotas, and the nature of a union. And,

   3d, On the manner of collection and expenditure.

   1st, On the sum itself, and the ability of the country. As I know my own
   calculation is as low as possible, and as the sum called for by congress,
   according to their calculation, agrees very nearly therewith, I am
   sensible it cannot possibly be lower. Neither can it be done for that,
   unless there is ready money to go to market with; and even in that case,
   it is only by the utmost management and economy that it can be made to do.

   By the accounts which were laid before the British Parliament last spring,
   it appeared that the charge of only subsisting, that is, feeding their
   army in America, cost annually four million pounds sterling, which is very
   nearly eighteen millions of dollars. Now if, for eight millions, we can
   feed, clothe, arm, provide for, and pay an army sufficient for our
   defence, the very comparison shows that the money must be well laid out.

   It may be of some use, either in debate or conversation, to attend to the
   progress of the expenses of an army, because it will enable us to see on
   what part any deficiency will fall.

   The first thing is, to feed them and prepare for the sick.

   Second, to clothe them.

   Third, to arm and furnish them.

   Fourth, to provide means for removing them from place to place. And,

   Fifth, to pay them.

   The first and second are absolutely necessary to them as men. The third
   and fourth are equally as necessary to them as an army. And the fifth is
   their just due. Now if the sum which shall be raised should fall short,
   either by the several acts of the states for raising it, or by the manner
   of collecting it, the deficiency will fall on the fifth head, the
   soldiers' pay, which would be defrauding them, and eternally disgracing
   ourselves. It would be a blot on the councils, the country, and the
   revolution of America, and a man would hereafter be ashamed to own that he
   had any hand in it.

   But if the deficiency should be still shorter, it would next fall on the
   fourth head, the means of removing the army from place to place; and, in
   this case, the army must either stand still where it can be of no use, or
   seize on horses, carts, wagons, or any means of transportation which it
   can lay hold of; and in this instance the country suffers. In short, every
   attempt to do a thing for less than it can be done for, is sure to become
   at last both a loss and a dishonor.

   But the country cannot bear it, say some. This has been the most expensive
   doctrine that ever was held out, and cost America millions of money for
   nothing. Can the country bear to be overrun, ravaged, and ruined by an
   enemy? This will immediately follow where defence is wanting, and defence
   will ever be wanting where sufficient revenues are not provided. But this
   is only one part of the folly. The second is, that when the danger comes,
   invited in part by our not preparing against it, we have been obliged, in
   a number of instances, to expend double the sums to do that which at first
   might have been done for half the money. But this is not all. A third
   mischief has been, that grain of all sorts, flour, beef, fodder, horses,
   carts, wagons, or whatever was absolutely or immediately wanted, have been
   taken without pay. Now, I ask, why was all this done, but from that
   extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that the country could not bear it?
   That is, that she could not bear, in the first instance, that which would
   have saved her twice as much at last; or, in proverbial language, that she
   could not bear to pay a penny to save a pound; the consequence of which
   has been, that she has paid a pound for a penny. Why are there so many
   unpaid certificates in almost every man's hands, but from the parsimony of
   not providing sufficient revenues? Besides, the doctrine contradicts
   itself; because, if the whole country cannot bear it, how is it possible
   that a part should? And yet this has been the case: for those things have
   been had; and they must be had; but the misfortune is, that they have been
   obtained in a very unequal manner, and upon expensive credit, whereas,
   with ready money, they might have been purchased for half the price, and
   nobody distressed.

   But there is another thought which ought to strike us, which is, how is
   the army to bear the want of food, clothing and other necessaries? The man
   who is at home, can turn himself a thousand ways, and find as many means
   of ease, convenience or relief: but a soldier's life admits of none of
   those: their wants cannot be supplied from themselves: for an army, though
   it is the defence of a state, is at the same time the child of a country,
   or must be provided for in every thing.

   And lastly, the doctrine is false. There are not three millions of people
   in any part of the universe, who live so well, or have such a fund of
   ability, as in America. The income of a common laborer, who is
   industrious, is equal to that of the generality of tradesmen in England.
   In the mercantile line, I have not heard of one who could be said to be a
   bankrupt since the war began, and in England they have been without
   number. In America almost every farmer lives on his own lands, and in
   England not one in a hundred does. In short, it seems as if the poverty of
   that country had made them furious, and they were determined to risk all
   to recover all.

   Yet, notwithstanding those advantages on the part of America, true it is,
   that had it not been for the operation of taxes for our necessary defence,
   we had sunk into a state of sloth and poverty: for there was more wealth
   lost by neglecting to till the earth in the years 1776, '77, and '78, than
   the quota of taxes amounts to. That which is lost by neglect of this kind,
   is lost for ever: whereas that which is paid, and continues in the
   country, returns to us again; and at the same time that it provides us
   with defence, it operates not only as a spur, but as a premium to our
   industry.

   I shall now proceed to the second head, viz., on the several quotas, and
   the nature of a union.

   There was a time when America had no other bond of union, than that of
   common interest and affection. The whole country flew to the relief of
   Boston, and, making her cause their own, participated in her cares and
   administered to her wants. The fate of war, since that day, has carried
   the calamity in a ten-fold proportion to the southward; but in the mean
   time the union has been strengthened by a legal compact of the states,
   jointly and severally ratified, and that which before was choice, or the
   duty of affection, is now likewise the duty of legal obligation.

   The union of America is the foundation-stone of her independence; the rock
   on which it is built; and is something so sacred in her constitution, that
   we ought to watch every word we speak, and every thought we think, that we
   injure it not, even by mistake. When a multitude, extended, or rather
   scattered, over a continent in the manner we were, mutually agree to form
   one common centre whereon the whole shall move to accomplish a particular
   purpose, all parts must act together and alike, or act not at all, and a
   stoppage in any one is a stoppage of the whole, at least for a time.

   Thus the several states have sent representatives to assemble together in
   Congress, and they have empowered that body, which thus becomes their
   centre, and are no other than themselves in representation, to conduct and
   manage the war, while their constituents at home attend to the domestic
   cares of the country, their internal legislation, their farms, professions
   or employments, for it is only by reducing complicated things to method
   and orderly connection that they can be understood with advantage, or
   pursued with success. Congress, by virtue of this delegation, estimates
   the expense, and apportions it out to the several parts of the empire
   according to their several abilities; and here the debate must end,
   because each state has already had its voice, and the matter has undergone
   its whole portion of argument, and can no more be altered by any
   particular state, than a law of any state, after it has passed, can be
   altered by any individual. For with respect to those things which
   immediately concern the union, and for which the union was purposely
   established, and is intended to secure, each state is to the United States
   what each individual is to the state he lives in. And it is on this grand
   point, this movement upon one centre, that our existence as a nation, our
   happiness as a people, and our safety as individuals, depend.

   It may happen that some state or other may be somewhat over or under
   rated, but this cannot be much. The experience which has been had upon the
   matter, has nearly ascertained their several abilities. But even in this
   case, it can only admit of an appeal to the United States, but cannot
   authorise any state to make the alteration itself, any more than our
   internal government can admit an individual to do so in the case of an act
   of assembly; for if one state can do it, then may another do the same, and
   the instant this is done the whole is undone.

   Neither is it supposable that any single state can be a judge of all the
   comparative reasons which may influence the collective body in arranging
   the quotas of the continent. The circumstances of the several states are
   frequently varying, occasioned by the accidents of war and commerce, and
   it will often fall upon some to help others, rather beyond what their
   exact proportion at another time might be; but even this assistance is as
   naturally and politically included in the idea of a union as that of any
   particular assigned proportion; because we know not whose turn it may be
   next to want assistance, for which reason that state is the wisest which
   sets the best example.

   Though in matters of bounden duty and reciprocal affection, it is rather a
   degeneracy from the honesty and ardor of the heart to admit any thing
   selfish to partake in the government of our conduct, yet in cases where
   our duty, our affections, and our interest all coincide, it may be of some
   use to observe their union. The United States will become heir to an
   extensive quantity of vacant land, and their several titles to shares and
   quotas thereof, will naturally be adjusted according to their relative
   quotas, during the war, exclusive of that inability which may
   unfortunately arise to any state by the enemy's holding possession of a
   part; but as this is a cold matter of interest, I pass it by, and proceed
   to my third head, viz., on the manner of collection and expenditure.

   It has been our error, as well as our misfortune, to blend the affairs of
   each state, especially in money matters, with those of the United States;
   whereas it is our case, convenience and interest, to keep them separate.
   The expenses of the United States for carrying on the war, and the
   expenses of each state for its own domestic government, are distinct
   things, and to involve them is a source of perplexity and a cloak for
   fraud. I love method, because I see and am convinced of its beauty and
   advantage. It is that which makes all business easy and understood, and
   without which, everything becomes embarrassed and difficult.

   There are certain powers which the people of each state have delegated to
   their legislative and executive bodies, and there are other powers which
   the people of every state have delegated to Congress, among which is that
   of conducting the war, and, consequently, of managing the expenses
   attending it; for how else can that be managed, which concerns each state,
   but by a delegation from each? When a state has furnished its quota, it
   has an undoubted right to know how it has been applied, and it is as much
   the duty of Congress to inform the state of the one, as it is the duty of
   the state to provide the other.

   In the resolution of Congress already excited, it is recommended to the
   several states to lay taxes for raising their quotas of money for the
   United States, separate from those laid for their own particular use.

   This is a most necessary point to be observed, and the distinction should
   follow all the way through. They should be levied, paid and collected,
   separately, and kept separate in every instance. Neither have the civil
   officers of any state, nor the government of that state, the least right
   to touch that money which the people pay for the support of their army and
   the war, any more than Congress has to touch that which each state raises
   for its own use.

   This distinction will naturally be followed by another. It will occasion
   every state to examine nicely into the expenses of its civil list, and to
   regulate, reduce, and bring it into better order than it has hitherto
   been; because the money for that purpose must be raised apart, and
   accounted for to the public separately. But while the monies of both were
   blended, the necessary nicety was not observed, and the poor soldier, who
   ought to have been the first, was the last who was thought of.

   Another convenience will be, that the people, by paying the taxes
   separately, will know what they are for; and will likewise know that those
   which are for the defence of the country will cease with the war, or soon
   after. For although, as I have before observed, the war is their own, and
   for the support of their own rights and the protection of their own
   property, yet they have the same right to know, that they have to pay, and
   it is the want of not knowing that is often the cause of dissatisfaction.

   This regulation of keeping the taxes separate has given rise to a
   regulation in the office of finance, by which it is directed:

   "That the receivers shall, at the end of every month, make out an exact
   account of the monies received by them respectively, during such month,
   specifying therein the names of the persons from whom the same shall have
   been received, the dates and the sums; which account they shall
   respectively cause to be published in one of the newspapers of the state;
   to the end that every citizen may know how much of the monies collected
   from him, in taxes, is transmitted to the treasury of the United States
   for the support of the war; and also, that it may be known what monies
   have been at the order of the superintendent of finance. It being proper
   and necessary, that, in a free country, the people should be as fully
   informed of the administration of their

   affairs as the nature of things will admit."

   It is an agreeable thing to see a spirit of order and economy taking
   place, after such a series of errors and difficulties. A government or an
   administration, who means and acts honestly, has nothing to fear, and
   consequently has nothing to conceal; and it would be of use if a monthly
   or quarterly account was to be published, as well of the expenditures as
   of the receipts. Eight millions of dollars must be husbanded with an
   exceeding deal of care to make it do, and, therefore, as the management
   must be reputable, the publication would be serviceable.

   I have heard of petitions which have been presented to the assembly of
   this state (and probably the same may have happened in other states)
   praying to have the taxes lowered. Now the only way to keep taxes low is,
   for the United States to have ready money to go to market with: and though
   the taxes to be raised for the present year will fall heavy, and there
   will naturally be some difficulty in paying them, yet the difficulty, in
   proportion as money spreads about the country, will every day grow less,
   and in the end we shall save some millions of dollars by it. We see what a
   bitter, revengeful enemy we have to deal with, and any expense is cheap
   compared to their merciless paw. We have seen the unfortunate Carolineans
   hunted like partridges on the mountains, and it is only by providing means
   for our defence, that we shall be kept from the same condition. When we
   think or talk about taxes, we ought to recollect that we lie down in peace
   and sleep in safety; that we can follow our farms or stores or other
   occupations, in prosperous tranquillity; and that these inestimable
   blessings are procured to us by the

   taxes that we pay. In this view, our taxes are properly our insurance
   money; they are what we pay to be made safe, and, in strict policy, are
   the best money we can lay out.

   It was my intention to offer some remarks on the impost law of five per
   cent, recommended by Congress, and to be established as a fund for the
   payment of the loan-office certificates, and other debts of the United
   States; but I have already extended my piece beyond my intention. And as
   this fund will make our system of finance complete, and is strictly just,
   and consequently requires nothing but honesty to do it, there needs but
   little to be said upon it.

   COMMON SENSE.
