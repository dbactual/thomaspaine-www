   Foner claims Paine wrote this, but there is no evidence, and it doesnâ€™t test that way at all. The two components are
   the Preamble, that appears to be written by Rush, and the Regulations. The Society was a collection of mostly conservative
   people with the common interest of preparing for the Constitutional Convention and insuring their interests. Franklin
   was the figurehead to give it legitimacy. Rush is the writer of the Preamble.

   The Society for Political Inquiries

   THE moral character and happiness of mankind are so interwoven with the
   operations of government, and the progress of the arts and sciences is so
   dependent on the nature of our political institutions that it is essential
   to the advancement of civilized society to give ample discussion to these
   topics.

   But important as these inquiries are to all, to the inhabitants of these
   republics they are objects of peculiar magnitude and necessity. Accustomed
   to look up to those nations, from whom we have derived our origin, for our
   laws, our opinions and our manners, we have retained with undistinguishing
   reverence their errors with their improvements have blended with our
   public institutions the policy of dissimilar countries; and have grafted
   on an infant commonwealth the manners of ancient and corrupted monarchies.
   In having effected a separate government, we have as yet effected but a
   partial independence. The Revolution can only be said to be complete, when
   we shall have freed ourselves, no less from the influence of foreign
   prejudices than from the fetters of foreign power. When breaking through
   the bounds, in which a dependent people have been accustomed to think and
   act, we shall probably comprehend the character we have assumed and adopt
   those maxims of policy which are suited to our new situation. While
   objects of subordinate importance have employed the associated labors of
   learned and ingenious men, the arduous and complicated science of
   government has been generally left to the care of practical politicians,
   or the speculations of individual theorists. From a desire of supplying
   this deficiency, and of promoting the welfare of our country, it is now
   proposed to establish a society for mutual improvement in the knowledge of
   government, and for the advancement of political science.

   With these views, the subscribers associate themselves under the title of
   THE SOCIETY FOR POLITICAL INQUIRIES, and under the following laws and
   regulations:
