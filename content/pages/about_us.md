Founded January 29, 1884 in New York City, TPNHA is among the oldest
historical associations in the United States, and the single most
respected source for accurate information about Thomas Paine. Our
mission is designed to ensure Paine's rightful place in history as a
preeminent founder of the United States of America, and the key
political theorist in the age of democratic revolutions around the
world.  In the course of his lifetime, Paine was the most influential
political, philosophical, and social figure in the entire world.

In 1925, under the leadership of President William van der Weyde and
Vice-President Thomas Alva Edison, the Association undertook the
initiative to build the Thomas Paine Memorial Building to honor Paine
and serve as the headquarters and gathering place for the Association.
