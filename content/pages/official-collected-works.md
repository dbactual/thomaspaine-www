Title: The Official Collected Works of Thomas Paine Project
Authors: 7


The Official Collected Works of Thomas Paine Project is being launched.

An international Editorial Board has been formed and work will begin
in late 2020. We need your help in locating Paine's privately-held
manuscript letters. Please contact us at
<a href="mailto:thomaspainecollectedworks@gmail.com">thomaspainecollectedworks@gmail.com</a>.

Editorial Board

- Gregory Claeys, University of London, Royal Holloway - Editor-in-Chief
- Scott Cleary, Iona College - Secretary
- Gary Berton, Thomas Paine National Historical Association - Research Director
- Carine Lounissi, University of Rouen, University of Paris
- Marc Belissa, University of Paris Nanterre
- Yannick Bosc, University of Rouen

This will be a comprehensive, accurate accounting of 50 years of
Paine's writings, with extensive previously unpublished
works. Although the correspondence located has been increased already
by 40%, we know most of his surviving letters are in private hands.

We need help in two areas:

1. Most missing Paine correspondence remains in private hands. If you
   hold a manuscript letter, or know someone who does, please refer them
   to us.

2. We need help in financing the Project. None of the members of the
   Editorial Board are being paid for their time or expertise, they are
   all volunteers. We have obtained small grants, but not nearly enough
  to see it to completion. Costs of travel, proofreading, supplies and
   materials, clerical help, etc. still need financing.
