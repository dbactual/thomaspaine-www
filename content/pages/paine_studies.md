The Institute has developed methods of author attribution using
software and statistical analysis. The Project seeks to properly
attribute works of Paine, and de-attribute falsely attributed
works. The results as we post them can be followed under [“Writings”](/pages/writings.html) on
this site, where there are “Newly discovered” and “Deattributed”
categories. For further information please contact us.
