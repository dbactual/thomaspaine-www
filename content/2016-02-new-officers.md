FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 

Thomas Paine National Historical Association Board Meeting Announces New Officers, 

Expanded Board

<i>New Rochelle, NY - February 10, 2016</i> – The Thomas Paine National
Historical Association (TPNHA), has announced an expanded Board of
Directors and new officers, both decided upon at its annual Directors
meeting held on January 29th, Thomas Paine’s birthday.

Secretary Gary Berton, the long-time driving force of the Association,
announced the results, and cited the great progress made over the last
few years: “I’m perhaps most proud of our establishment of the
Institute of Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College, where the study of
Thomas Paine’s life and political writings helps introduce a new
generation of scholars to his ideas.”  Incoming President Matthew
Jacobs thanked the board for the opportunity to head the Association,
noting “It’s humbling to take charge of the legacy of Paine’s memory.
He was an extraordinary historical figure, and a man of great
conviction and honor.  He always stood up for his ideas and
principles, even in the face of great personal harm.  Together we will
continue to further the studies of Paine, and to sustain the legacy of
this great man.”

Founded in 1884, TPNHA is America’s oldest society dedicated to
keeping alive the ideas, memory and spirit of founding father Thomas
Paine (1737-1809).  The celebrated author of Common Sense, Rights of
Man, and other famous works played an active role in both the American
and French Revolutions, and has been an inspiring figure to patriots
and lovers of liberty for generations.
