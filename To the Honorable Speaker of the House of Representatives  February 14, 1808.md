From the records of the Annals of Congress, 10th Congress, 2nd Session.

New York, February, 14, 1808.

CITIZEN REPRESENTATIVES:

In my memorial to Congress of the 21st of January, I spoke of a resolve of the old Congress 
of three thousand dollars to me, and said that the resolve had relation to a matter it did 
not express; that Elbridge Gerry was chairman of the committee that brought in that resolve; 
and that if Congress referred the memorial to a committee, I would write to that committee, 
and inform them of the particulars of it. It has relation to my conduct in the affair of 
Silas Dean and Beaumarchais. The case is as follows:

When I was appointed secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, all the papers of the 
secret committee, none of which had been seen by Congress, came into my hands. I saw, by 
the correspondence of that committee with persons in Europe, particularly with Arthur Lee, 
that the stores which Silas Dean and Beaumarchais pretended they had purchased were a 
present from the Court of France, and came out of the  King's arsenals. But, as this was 
prior to the alliance, and while the English ambassador (Stormont) was at Paris, the 
court of France wished it not to be known, and therefore proposed that "a small quantity 
of tobacco, or some other produce, should be sent to the Cape (Cape Francois) to give it 
the air of a mercantile transaction, repeating over and over again that it was for a 
cover only, and not for payment, as the whole remittance was gratuitous." (See Arthur Lee's 
letters to the secret committee; see also Benjamin Franklin's.)

Knowing these things, and seeing that the public were deceived and imposed upon by the 
pretensions of Dean, I took the subject up, and published three pieces in Dunlap's 
Philadelphia paper, headed with the title of "Common Sense to the Public on Mr. Dean's 
affairs." John Jay was then President of Congress, Mr. Laurens having resigned in disgust.

After the third piece appeared, I received an order, dated Congress, and signed John Jay, 
that "Thomas Paine do attend at the bar of this House immediately," which I did.

Mr. Jay took up a newspaper, and said, "Here is Mr. Dunlap's paper of December 29. In it 
is a piece entitled 'Common Sense to the Public on Mr. Dean's affairs;' I am directed by 
Congress to ask you if you are the author." "Yes, sir, I am the author of that piece." 
Mr. Jay put the same question on the other two pieces, and received the same answer. 
He then said, you may withdraw.

As soon as I was gone, John Pen, of North Carolina, moved that "Thomas Paine be discharged 
from the office of secretary of the Committee for Foreign Affairs," and prating Gouverneur 
Morris seconded the motion; but it was lost when put to the vote, the States being equally 
divided. I then wrote to Congress, requesting a hearing, and Mr. Laurens made a motion for 
that purpose, which was negatived. The next day I sent in my resignation, saying, that 
"as I cannot, consistently with my character as a freeman, submit to be censured unheard, 
therefore, to preserve that character and maintain that right, I think it my duty to 
resign the office of secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs, and I do hereby 
resign the same."

After this I lived as well as I could, hiring myself as a clerk to Owen Biddle, of 
Philadelphia, till the Legislature of Pennsylvania appointed me clerk of the General 
Assembly. But I still went on with my publications on Dean's affairs, till the fraud 
became so obvious, that Congress were ashamed of supporting him, and he absconded. He 
went from Philadelphia to Virginia, and took shipping for France, and got over to England, 
where he died. Doctor Cutting told me he took poison.  Gouverneur Morris, by way of making 
apology for his conduct in that affair, said to me, after my return from France with 
Colonel Laurens, "Well! we were all duped, and I among the rest."

As the salary I had as secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs was but small, 
being only $800 a year, and as that had been fretted down by the depreciation to less 
than a fifth of its nominal value, I wrote to Congress, then sitting at New York 
(it was after the war,) to make up the depreciation of my salary, and also for some 
incidental expenses I had been at. This letter was referred to a committee, of which 
Elbridge Gerry was chairman.

Mr. Gerry then came to me, and said that the committee had consulted on the subject, and 
they intended to bring in a handsome report, but that they thought it best not to take 
any notice of your letter or make any reference to Dean's affair or your salary. They 
will indemnify you, said he, without it. The case is, there are some motions on the 
Journal of Congress, for censuring you with respect to Dean's affair, which cannot now 
be recalled, because they have been printed. Therefore, we will bring in a report that 
will supersede them, without mentioning the purport of your letter.

This, citizen representatives, is an explanation of the resolve of the old Congress. 
It was an indemnity to me for some injustice done me, for Congress had acted dishonorably 
to me. However, I prevented Dean's fraudulent demand being paid, and so far the country 
is obliged to me; but I became the victim of my integrity.

I preferred stating this explanation to the committee rather than to make it public in 
my memorial to Congress.

THOMAS PAINE.
